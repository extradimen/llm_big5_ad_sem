**Evaluation Notes:**

1. **Ad Attitude**:  
   - *Like*: Neutral, as the ad appeals but doesn't strike a strong emotional chord given my personality traits and concerns about fatigue.
   - *Interesting*: Agree, due to its relevance in addressing common issues related to energy levels and appearance.
   - *Good*: Strongly Agree, because the ad effectively conveys benefits (energy boost, improved look), aligning with both practical needs and general trust in health-focused products.
   - *Attractive*: Agree, finding it visually engaging but not overly compelling given my reserved nature.

2. **Purchase Intention**:  
   - *Intend to purchase*: Disagree, despite believing the product is good; ongoing education (student) and current circumstances make immediate purchase less likely.
   - *Try to buy*: Neutral, open to trying if contextually appropriate or after further consideration.
   - *Consider buying*: Strongly Agree, considering its potential benefits, especially during times of stress or when feeling fatigued.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad's persuasiveness and message alignment with my health-consciousness, personal circumstances, lifestyle factors, and cautious approach mean that immediate purchase is less likely but consideration remains high.
