**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - *I like the ad.* (2): The statement feels a bit exaggerated and lacks resonance for my reserved nature.
  - *I think the ad is interesting.* (3): Neutral; it's not particularly engaging given my preference for straightforward information over hyped-up claims.
  - *I believe the ad is good.* (4): Somewhat positive, but cautious due to its emphasis on negative consequences rather than clear benefits or credibility.
  - *I find the ad attractive.* (1): Not appealing; it's too fear-based and doesn't align with my generally trusting yet critical mindset.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *I intend to purchase this product.* (1): Strongly disagree. The persuasive tactics donâ€™t convince me as a cautious, careful consumer.
  - *I will try to buy this product.* (2): Mild curiosity but low intent; the ad doesn't provide enough information or personal relevance for an immediate trial.
  - *I will consider buying this product.* (2): Neutral-to-mild consideration only if I see additional details about efficacy, ingredients, and user feedback.

Overall, while understanding its intention to prevent fatigue and dullness, my reserved nature and preference for more substantiated claims lead me to be skeptical of the ad's appeal. Hence, a low tendency towards purchase despite some mild interest in exploring further information.
