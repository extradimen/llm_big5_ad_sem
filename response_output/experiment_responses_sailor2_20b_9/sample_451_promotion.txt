**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: 
  - **Like (3/7)**: The overall concept is neutral to me; I don't strongly dislike but also not inclined.
  - **Interesting (4/7)**: It seems slightly engaging due to its promise of energy and appearance benefits, though it doesn’t grab my full attention.
  - **Good (2/7)**: While the message aims for positive outcomes like staying energized and looking good, I find it generic and not exceptionally compelling given my preferences.
  - **Attractive (5/7)**: The promise of visual appeal somewhat catches my eye, but overall presentation doesn't strongly attract me.

- **Purchase intention**: 
  - **Intend to purchase this product (1/7)**: While the features might be useful, there's no strong incentive for immediate action or loyalty.
  - **Will try to buy this product (2/7)**: I'm mildly curious and may consider a single trial out of convenience rather than excitement.
  - **Consider buying this product (3/7)**: There is minimal consideration as my needs aren’t strongly aligned with the ad, but it’s not ruled out entirely.

Given my reserved nature and lack of strong emotional or social triggers from the advertisement, these scores reflect a balanced yet cautious response. Though I acknowledge its potential benefits, personal preferences and current context don't drive a high purchase intent.
