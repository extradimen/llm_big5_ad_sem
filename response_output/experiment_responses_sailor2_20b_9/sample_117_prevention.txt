**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
   - **I like the ad:** Neutral (Score of 5) – The claim about feeling tired and looking dull is attention-grabbing but doesn't resonate strongly given my active lifestyle.
   - **Interesting:** Mildly Agree (4) – It’s a standard health-related message, somewhat interesting for someone concerned with energy levels and appearance.
   - **Good Ad:** Neutral-to-Negative (3) – While effective in targeting concerns about fatigue and lethargy, it lacks novelty or emotional engagement for me.
   - **Attractive:** Disagree (2) – The appeal feels more obligatory than attractive; I'm not drawn to the ad's style or creativity.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Neutral-to-Low (3) – There’s a consideration but not enough convincing factors based on my current habits and skepticism.
   - **Will Try Buy:** Low (2) – Without strong personal need, I’m unlikely to act upon the ad alone.
   - **Consider Buying:** Neutral (3) – The product does address common issues; hence it's worth considering as a potential option if other factors align.

This evaluation reflects my balanced skepticism and practicality given my personality traits and background. While acknowledging its relevance, the advertisement doesn't strongly compel me to make an immediate purchase decision.
