**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad (score: 2):** The talkative nature of the ad doesn't appeal to me much.
   - **Interesting (score: 3):** It holds some intrigue but not enough given my slightly neutral outlook on sociability.
   - **Good (score: 4):** Provides a clear message about energy and appearance, which is somewhat relevant.
   - **Attractive (score: 3):** Not highly attractive due to personal reservations about trust and thoroughness.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product (score: 1):** Strongly disagree; the advertisement doesn't inspire me enough given my cautious nature and financial constraints.
   - **Try to buy this product (score: 2):** Slightly agree, might give it a try but not immediately or frequently due to budget concerns.
   - **Consider buying this product (score: 3):** Neutral/agree; the idea of alleviating fatigue is worth considering in my daily routine.

Overall, while there's some recognition of its utility and potential benefit, personal traits like being cautious and worried about finances keep the purchase intention relatively low. The ad is not compelling enough to override these factors.
