**Evaluation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - *I like the ad (Score 3):* The advertisement's claims about fatigue and dullness resonate somewhat due to daily stress, but it doesn't excite me greatly.
   - *Interesting (Score 4):* It introduces an issue clearly, which makes it moderately interesting.
   - *Good (Score 5):* I see the relevance in addressing tiredness; hence, I find this ad generally good without being overly convincing.
   - *Attractive (Score 2):* The design and messaging don't strongly appeal to my reserved nature.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *Intend to purchase (Score 2):* While the concerns are relatable, a strong intent isnâ€™t there given my financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND/month).
   - *Try to buy (Score 3):* I might consider sampling it if affordable and accessible.
   - *Consider buying (Score 4):* Despite some hesitations, the product could be a thoughtful investment for sustained energy given its relevance.

Overall, though the ad makes valid points about fatigue, my reserved personality and limited budget moderate my inclination to buy. Hence, I have balanced scores reflecting consideration but not strong commitment.
