**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad:** (3) Neutral. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull resonates with common consumer fears but lacks personal engagement due to my reserved nature.
- **I think the ad is interesting:** (4) Somewhat Agree. It piques curiosity as it addresses a concern, though not exceptionally engaging for me.
- **I believe the ad is good:** (2) Disagree. While effective in highlighting a problem, I see room for more compelling evidence or differentiation from similar products.
- **I find the ad attractive:** (3) Neutral. It meets basic standards of appealing messaging but doesn't strongly attract my attention.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product:** (1) Strongly Disagree. Despite acknowledging potential benefits, other factors like price, brand loyalty, and personal priorities weigh against immediate intention.
- **I will try to buy this product:** (1) Strongly Disagree. I have no motivation or urgency to give it a trial based on the ad alone.
- **I will consider buying this product:** (1) Strongly Disagree. While some concerns are addressed, my strong reservation and existing brand preferences make consideration minimal.

In summary, while moderately acknowledging the ad's effectiveness in addressing consumer fears, I find its appeal limited due to my reserved nature and lack of compelling features for immediate or considered purchase intention.
