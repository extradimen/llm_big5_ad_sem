**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - *Like (Neutral):* While the ad is somewhat engaging due to its straightforward message, my preference for directness and occasional rudeness makes it not entirely likable.
   - *Interesting (Agree):* The prevention aspect appeals because it addresses potential fatigue and dullness—problems that resonant with a busy office worker's reality.
   - *Good (Strongly Agree):* Given its clear benefit of combating tiredness, the ad effectively communicates a valuable solution despite my reservations about marketing tactics.
   - *Attractive (Disagree):* The visual or emotional appeal is lacking; it might feel too clinical and not align well with my outgoing but sometimes rude nature.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *Intend to Purchase:* Neutral leaning towards Agree, as the potential benefits are significant for maintaining energy levels.
   - *Try to Buy:* Slightly higher at Agree due to the ad's persuasive message about preventing fatigue—driving curiosity but not an immediate urgency.
   - *Consider Buying:* Strongly Consider, reflecting a balance between skepticism and recognizing its relevance. My need to stay alert is high, making this product worthy of consideration despite my critical nature.

Overall, while I have mixed feelings about the ad's presentation, the compelling message resonates with my practical needs as an office worker facing daily fatigue challenges. Thus, it encourages thoughtful evaluation rather than immediate purchase.
