**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **I like the ad (5)**: The claim of staying energized and looking good resonates moderately with my desire for well-being but isn't a strong emotional hook.
   - **It's interesting (4)**: Offers appealing benefits, making it engaging to an extent.
   - **I believe itâ€™s good (3)**: Neutral belief due to mixed feelings about health product ads' credibility and effectiveness.
   - **Find it attractive (2)**: Slightly lower attractiveness as I prioritize thorough verification over quick visual appeal.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase:** Although not strongly, a score of 6 indicates some inclination because the benefits align with personal goals.
   - **Will try to buy:** Stronger (7) due to curiosity and previous positive experiences with similar health beverages.
   - **Consider buying:** Balanced score of 6 reflecting moderate consideration; though I'm cautious, potential value justifies further evaluation.

Overall, while my skepticism on trustworthiness nudges the ad's attractiveness downward, its practical benefits drive a strong likelihood towards considering or trying the product. My tendency to make plans (Strongly Agree) aligns with exploring this as part of routine management.
