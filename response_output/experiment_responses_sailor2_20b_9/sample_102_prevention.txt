**Evaluation Details:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - *Like the Ad (2)*: Neutral because, as a reserved individual who prioritizes practicality over superficial appeal, I find it neither overwhelmingly positive nor negative.
   - *Interesting (3)*: Disagree; prevention-focused ads are not typically engaging for me given my preference for more direct and relevant content.
   - *Good Quality (4)*: Agree; the message about fatigue alleviation aligns with practical benefits, making it seem credible despite being cautious of general claims.
   - *Attractive (3)*: Disagree; while appealing to health concerns is important, its presentation doesn’t resonate strongly enough.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *Intend to Purchase (5)*: Neutral; I’m open to the idea but need more information and reassurance about quality.
   - *Try to Buy (4)*: Disagree; direct purchase intent is low due to reservations regarding the product's effectiveness, based on past experiences with similar offerings.
   - *Consider Buying (4)*: Agree; although cautious, I acknowledge it as a possible solution for fatigue management and would review more details before making a decision.

In summary, while acknowledging its potential benefits, my balanced but somewhat reserved outlook leads to moderate interest without strong immediate purchase intent. The ad must address concerns about trustworthiness and practical value better to sway me towards action.
