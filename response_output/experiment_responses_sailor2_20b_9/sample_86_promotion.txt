**Evaluation and Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **I like the ad (Score = 4):** While I appreciate energetic promotions, my reserved nature means it doesn't fully resonate with me.
  - **Interesting (Score = 3):** The claims about energy and appearance might interest someone more outgoing or younger; for me, it’s somewhat engaging but not thrilling.
  - **Good (Score = 2):** As a civil servant, I value practicality. This ad lacks specific benefits that appeal to my needs directly, making its quality seem average.
  - **Attractive (Score = 3):** My sociable side sees potential in the message, but it falls short due to lack of depth and personal relevance.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product (Score = 1):** Given my strong preference for being unselfish over self-care products, I’m unlikely to prioritize such an item.
  - **Will try to buy this product (Score = 1):** No compelling reason or urgency exists in the ad to drive a trial purchase.
  - **Consider buying this product (Score = 1):** Even though I have high monthly income and artistic creativity, daily energy drinks do not fit my current priorities or lifestyle.

Overall, while understanding its appeal for others, this advertisement does not effectively persuade me due to personal values and lifestyle factors. The score reflects a generally neutral-to-negative reaction with no significant purchase intention from someone like myself.
