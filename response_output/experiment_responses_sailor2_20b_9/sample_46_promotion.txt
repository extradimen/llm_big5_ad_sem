**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3)** - While I appreciate energetic and appealing messaging, it doesn't strongly resonate with me personally.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)** - The concept of staying energized does draw some attention; however, it’s not particularly captivating for my routine or interests.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5)** - On a general level, promoting wellness and appearance can be beneficial, so I find it somewhat effective but not groundbreaking.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)** - Being more reserved and focused on practicality rather than aesthetics, this part of the message doesn't significantly attract me.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)** - While I value energy drinks for certain situations, my current routine is stable with established options.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 1)** - Given that it's not a top priority and doesn’t align closely with my preferences or needs, trying it feels less likely.
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3)** - If there’s an occasion where I need additional energy and convenience, I might give it a thought but not actively seek out.

In summary, the ad is moderately well-received in terms of interest and goodness but lacks strong attraction to me as someone who values thoroughness over flashy marketing. Purchase intention remains low due to existing routines and lack of compelling reason for change.
