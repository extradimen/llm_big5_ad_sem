**Evaluation and Reasoning:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**  
   - *Like (Score: 4)*: I find it somewhat appealing since feeling tired is relatable.
   - *Interesting (Score: 5)*: The concept of preventing fatigue resonates, making it an engaging premise.
   - *Good (Score: 6)*: While not perfect, the message effectively addresses common concerns about energy and appearance.
   - *Attractive (Score: 3)*: It has some charm but isn't extremely appealing due to potential overstatement or lack of personal connection.

2. **Purchase Intention:**  
   - *Intend (Score: 2)*: I'm not strongly committed to buying right now, as there are other factors like brand trust and cost.
   - *Try (Score: 2)*: There's a slight inclination to give it a try if the price is reasonable or recommended by peers.
   - *Consider (Score: 4)*: It warrants consideration alongside alternative options; I'm open-minded but cautious.

Overall, while I appreciate its relevance and messaging, my tendency towards careful decision-making means strong purchase intent isn't immediate. The ad effectively targets concerns about tiredness and appearance, making it moderately persuasive yet not entirely convincing to prompt an instant buy.
