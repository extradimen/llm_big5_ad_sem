**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (Score: 3)  
   While it sounds appealing and aligned with wanting to stay energized, my sociable nature doesn't strongly connect me emotionally to ads that focus solely on appearance.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (Score: 4)  
   The promise of energy and looking good sparks curiosity but feels slightly generic without specific details or personal relevance.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Neutral (Score: 5)  
   It's a standard claim, balancing between effectiveness for me personally and its overall presentation quality.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree (Score: 2)  
   The emphasis on appearance doesn't strongly resonate with my values; I value practical benefits over aesthetic promises more deeply.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (Score: 1)  
   Despite finding the concept interesting, there's no strong impetus to make a decision given other competing priorities and routine purchases.

2. **Will try to buy this product:** Neutral (Score: 3)  
   I might consider giving it a chance if recommended by friends or in special offers, but not actively seeking it out.

3. **Will consider buying this product:** Disagree (Score: 2)  
   Though open to new experiences, the ad isn't compelling enough for me to prioritize over my existing routines and budget constraints.

In summary, while I acknowledge its appeal due to being outgoing and sociable, the advertisement doesnâ€™t drive a strong purchase intention given my conservative planning habits and tendency towards practical benefits.
