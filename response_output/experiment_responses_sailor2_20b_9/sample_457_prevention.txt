**Evaluation Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
   - **Like (Score 4):** Neutral-leaning towards agreement. The ad resonates on a basic level but doesn't excite me greatly.
   - **Interesting (Score 5):** Agree; the idea of avoiding tiredness and dull appearance is appealing as it relates to daily well-being, especially for someone balancing work with family responsibilities.
   - **Good (Score 3):** Neutral. The ad's claim seems reasonable but lacks a compelling reason or emotional connection beyond surface-level benefits.
   - **Attractive (Score 4):** Slightly agree; the messaging is clear and straightforward, making it somewhat attractive despite being typical for this product category.

- **Purchase Intentions:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Score 2 (Disagree). While I appreciate staying active and vibrant, my current budget constraints (30 million VND monthly) put higher priority on essential needs. Plus, the ad's generic nature doesn't create a strong enough incentive.
   - **Try to Buy:** Score 1 (Strongly Disagree); given limited disposable income, trying the product isn't feasible unless there are significant discounts or compelling long-term benefits offered elsewhere.
   - **Consider Buying:** Score 3 (Neutral). Despite personal and financial reservations, I acknowledge that products aimed at energy levels can be useful. Thus, if conditions change (e.g., special offers), it might enter my consideration list.

Overall, the advertisement has a moderately positive reception but falls short in converting to immediate purchase intention due to budget constraints and an unexceptional presentation of benefits. It's seen as helpful advice rather than a compelling reason for spending now.
