**Explanation:**

### Attitudes Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (score = 4)**: Neutral leaning toward liking it slightly as the message is straightforward but doesn't strongly connect with me personally.
   
2. **Interesting (score = 5)**: I find the idea engaging since fatigue and appearance are relatable concerns, making it somewhat interesting.

3. **Good (score = 6)**: The ad effectively highlights a common issue, which feels informative without being overly manipulative—thus viewed as good content.

4. **Attractive (score = 3)**: Although not unappealing, the appeal is minimal due to my reserved nature and preference for more direct communication styles over persuasive tactics alone.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product (score = 2)**: Neutral leaning toward a low intent as I am practical and would require additional information beyond the ad's claims.

2. **Will try to buy this product (score = 1.5)**: Slightly less inclined due to my reserved nature and preference for proven products, not just marketing promises.
  
3. **Consider buying this product (score = 2)**: While I acknowledge it as a potential solution, there's hesitation; thus, the consideration is moderate but open.

Overall, while finding some value in the ad’s messaging, practicality and personal preferences lead to cautious attitudes toward purchasing action.
