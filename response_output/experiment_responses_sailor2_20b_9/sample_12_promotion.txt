**Evaluation and Justification:**

**Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
1. **Like (3):** While talkative by nature, I find the message somewhat engaging but not particularly exciting given my daily routine as a blue-collar worker.
2. **Interesting (4):** The promise of energy boost is relevant, making it moderately interesting despite being slightly overplayed in similar ads.
3. **Good (2):** As a generally careful and thorough individual, I question the credibility without solid evidence or personal testimonials – thus lowering my perception of its quality.
4. **Attractive (1):** The ad’s aesthetics may appeal to younger demographics; for me, it doesn't resonate strongly due to practical concerns about efficacy over appearance.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **Intend (2):** Though the idea seems beneficial, I'm not convinced enough by this advertisement alone.
2. **Try (2):** There's a willingness to consider testing based on its utility for daily energy needs but no strong impulse drive.
3. **Consider (3):** The product merits further evaluation, especially considering peer recommendations or direct experience before making a purchase.

Overall, while the ad sparks mild interest and consideration, my cautious nature and lack of emotional connection limit both attraction and immediate purchasing intent. Further information would likely shift these scores slightly higher.
