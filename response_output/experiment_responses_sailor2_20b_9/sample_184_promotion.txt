**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - **Like (Score 4):** While I appreciate the concept of staying energized and looking good, it doesn't particularly excite me due to my preference for more practical benefits.
  - **Interesting (Score 3):** The message is straightforward but not novel enough. It's a common claim in many energy drinks, so the novelty factor isnâ€™t high.
  - **Good (Score 5):** I see value and utility in maintaining good health and appearance; thus, it aligns with my belief in taking care of myself.
  - **Attractive (Score 4):** The ad is moderately appealing but lacks a strong emotional connection or personal relevance for me.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to Purchase:** Despite the positive sentiment towards health and energy benefits, I don't feel compelled enough to purchase without more specific incentives.
  - **Try to Buy (Score 1):** Given my cautious approach ("Strongly Disagree" with being careless) and worries about financial investments on uncertain products, I'm unlikely to make an immediate effort to buy it.
  - **Consider Buying:** While I acknowledge the benefits presented, external factors like price points, brand reputation, and personal needs would heavily influence a potential purchase. Hence, there is a moderate consideration but no strong commitment.

Overall, while acknowledging its worthiness in theory, practical considerations and my balanced perspective lead to modest scores reflecting caution rather than enthusiasm.
