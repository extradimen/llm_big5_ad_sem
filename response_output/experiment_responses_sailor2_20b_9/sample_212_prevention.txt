3. **I believe the ad is good:** Slightly Positive (scored as 4) - The messaging effectively addresses fatigue and appearance concerns, which can be relevant for daily life.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Strongly Disagree (scored as 1) – Despite its relevance, my strong anxiety makes me uncomfortable with high-pressure statements.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (scored as 1) - Emotional unease outweighs practical appeal.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Neutral leaning towards Disagreement (scored as 2) – There's no immediate desire, but openness might be influenced by additional information or trust-building content.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** Slightly Positive (scored as 2) - While cautious, the potential benefits could make me reconsider after further research.
