**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
- **Like (score = 3):**
  - Neutral talkativeness and being helpful indicate I'm open to good messages but not overly enthusiastic.
  
- **Interesting (score = 4):**
  - While slightly agreeable, as a civil servant with daily responsibilities, practicality trumps immediate appeal.

- **Good (score = 5):**
  - Agree that the message about staying energized and looking your best is positive, aligning with maintaining health, but not overly persuasive on its own.
  
- **Attractive (score = 2):**
  - Strongly disagreeing being reserved makes it less visually appealing or engaging for me.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend to purchase this product (score = 1):** 
  - Given my cautious nature and not finding the ad particularly compelling, I have no immediate intention.
  
- **Try to buy this product (score = 1):**
  - Strongly disagree; current stable routine doesn't prompt experimentation without more convincing factors.

- **Consider buying this product (score = 2):**
  - Slightly agree as health-oriented benefits are good, but not enough to make an active purchase consideration right now due to my existing lifestyle balance and budget constraints. 

Overall, while recognizing the ad's positive intentions, its appeal falls short for me given my personality traits and current state of affairs. The lackluster attractiveness and lower intent scores reflect a neutral-to-negative reaction despite acknowledging its value proposition.
