**Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **Like the ad (Score = 4)** - The energy and appearance benefits appeal to my desire for staying active and looking good.
2. **Interesting (Score = 5)** - It's engaging but not groundbreaking since similar products exist in Southeast Asia with comparable claims.
3. **Believe it's good (Score = 6)** - While I trust the idea of improved energy, skepticism remains about its real impact without further evidence or reviews from trusted sources.
4. **Attractive (Score = 3)** - The visual and messaging are acceptable but not compelling enough to make me feel emotionally drawn in.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **Intend to purchase** (Score = 2) - I'm cautious; while the ad resonates, my budget-conscious mindset makes me hesitant without concrete proof of effectiveness.
2. **Try to buy** (Score = 3) - There's a moderate interest due to its benefits aligning with personal goals, but it doesn't compel an immediate purchase.
3. **Consider buying** (Score = 3) - I'll definitely look into customer reviews and compare prices before deciding if it fits within my budget.

Overall, while the ad is decently persuasive for someone like me, it doesnâ€™t sway me enough to act impulsively or strongly consider a buy without further evaluation. The balance between benefits, credibility, and personal financial constraints are key factors guiding my cautious approach.
