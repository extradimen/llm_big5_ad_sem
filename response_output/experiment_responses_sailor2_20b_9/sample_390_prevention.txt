**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** Disagree (Score = 2)
   - My reserved nature and general mistrust make me skeptical of health-related claims.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Neutral to Agree (Score = 3-4)
   - While I find it somewhat engaging, especially as a civil servant needing energy, it lacks novelty for my taste.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Agree (Score = 4)
   - The message aims at preventing fatigue and dullness which appeals on some level; however, it feels generic rather than compelling.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** Strongly Disagree (Score = 1)
   - It lacks visual appeal or emotional connection to me personally due to its overused tired-looking stereotype.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Neutral to Slightly Agree (Score = 2-3)
   - The ad's claims resonate with the need for energy, but my cautious nature and lack of strong interest prevent a solid intention.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** Considered Try (Score = 3)
   - I'm open to giving it a chance if others report positive results or if there are trustworthy endorsements from colleagues.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** Agree (Score = 4)
   - Overall, the ad does encourage consideration for those who experience fatigue regularly but doesn't push me over the edge to an immediate purchase decision. 

Balancing skepticism with practicality keeps my intention moderately inclined towards exploration rather than definitive commitment.
