**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **I like the ad:** (Score = 3)
   - While I appreciate its attempt to address fatigue and appearance concerns, my reserved nature means it doesn't strike me as particularly engaging.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score = 4)
   - It does highlight a real problem that resonates with busy individuals like civil servants, making it slightly intriguing but not compelling enough for strong interest.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score = 2)
   - Despite being somewhat relevant, I find its straightforward messaging lacks creativity and may come across as manipulative, hence a low score.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score = 5)
   - The focus on preventing tiredness and looking dull appeals to my sense of responsibility for personal well-being; it's moderately attractive but not overwhelmingly so.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score = 2)
   - I value thorough work, but given the current level of trust in products from advertisements (Strongly Disagree), thereâ€™s little intent without further research or personal experience.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score = 2.5)
   - Slightly higher than intention due to curiosity about its effectiveness; I might give it a trial, but not actively seek it out immediately.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score = 3)
   - The ad prompts consideration as dealing with fatigue aligns with my values and work demands. However, cautiousness from past experiences prevents full commitment without additional evidence or recommendations. 

Overall, while the ad has some appeal due to its relevance, it doesn't fully convince me given my reserved nature and skepticism toward advertisements. Further proof of efficacy would likely sway consideration towards actual purchase intent.
