**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:** 
  - **Like (3)**: While not strongly negative, I have a neutral to mildly positive view. The ad does its job in highlighting the consequences of lacking energy.
  - **Interesting (4)**: It piques curiosity but doesn't wow me; it's straightforward and functional rather than engaging.
  - **Good (3)**: Adequate messaging but lacks emotional depth or creative flair, so I find it somewhat mediocre.
  - **Attractive (2)**: The ad isn’t visually compelling for me. Its focus on negative outcomes can be off-putting due to my general nervousness and tendency towards caution.

- **Purchase Intention:** 
  - **Intend (2)**: Despite the neutral-to-good messaging, I'm not strongly motivated enough to intend a purchase.
  - **Try (1)**: Given past experiences with similar products being oversold, skepticism pushes me toward lower intent despite some acknowledgment of its potential benefits.
  - **Consider (3)**: I am open-minded and might consider giving it a try if reviews or other factors later reinforce the product’s efficacy.

Overall, while the ad is reasonably well-crafted in conveying necessity, my cautious nature and preference for thoroughness make me inclined towards lower purchase intention without additional reassurances.
