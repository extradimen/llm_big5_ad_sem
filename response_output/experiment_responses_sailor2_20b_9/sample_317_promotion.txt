**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
- **Like the ad (score = 3)**: While not strongly positive, I find it mildly enjoyable due to its straightforward messaging.
  
- **Interesting**: Neutral leaning slightly towards interesting (`4`). It doesn't captivate me deeply but does pique curiosity briefly.

- **Good quality of ad** (`2`): The message is clear—energizing and looking good—but feels generic. It lacks personal appeal given my reserved nature and preference for originality.

- **Attractive**: Mildly attractive (`3`). Although the visuals might be engaging, they don’t fully resonate with me emotionally or align well with my cautious and slightly critical mindset.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend to purchase (score = 1)**: Strongly disagree. Despite understanding its benefits, I'm not inclined to buy due to several factors including budget constraints, skepticism about quick fixes, and a generally reserved approach to trying new products without thorough research.
  
- **Try to buy** (`2`): Neutral leaning towards negative; it's unlikely that this ad alone will prompt an immediate purchase attempt.

- **Consider buying (score = 3)**: Mildly agree. There might be a future consideration if I encounter more positive reviews or personal need for energy and appearance boosts, but the initial impact is minimal.

In summary, while not outright dismissive, my scores reflect cautious optimism with reservations—balancing pragmatic concerns against the ad's promises.
