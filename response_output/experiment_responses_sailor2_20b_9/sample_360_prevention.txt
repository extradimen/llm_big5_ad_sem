**Evaluation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - I like the ad (Score: 3): The message about avoiding tiredness and looking dull resonates with practicality but doesn't generate strong personal excitement.
  - I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4): It captures attention due to the potential benefits, although it's not gripping or innovative enough for my taste.
  - I believe the ad is good (Score: 3): The message seems credible and health-focused, but its appeal falls short of convincing me strongly.
  - I find the ad attractive (Score: 2): As a civil servant with strong focus on thoroughness and reliability, the aesthetics or emotional pull are minimal.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1): Despite acknowledging the benefits, my current financial situation (monthly income range) makes spontaneous high-cost purchases less likely.
  - I will try to buy this product (Score: 1): There's no compelling reason or urgency for me to actively seek it out despite fatigue being an issue.
  - I will consider buying this product (Score: 2): If the price aligns with my budget and there are assurances about effectiveness, consideration might happen after further evaluation.

Overall, while understanding its appeal in terms of health benefits, the ad lacks emotional connection or immediate relevance to significantly influence a purchase decision for someone like myself. Hence, I'm moderately inclined but not committed to buying it.
