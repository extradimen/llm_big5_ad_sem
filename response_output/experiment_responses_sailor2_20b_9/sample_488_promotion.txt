**Explanation:**
- **Ad Attitude Scores:**  
  - *Like (2):* Disagree slightly; it doesn't excite me personally.  
  - *Interesting (3):* Neutral but somewhat engaging as staying energized and looking good are universal needs.  
  - *Good (4):* Slightly agree, finds the proposition decently presented though not very compelling for my taste.  
  - *Attractive (3):* Somewhat appealing but lacks strong emotional draw.
- **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
  - *Intend (1):* Strongly Disagree; I'm not motivated enough to make a purchase based on this ad alone.  
  - *Try (2):* Mild interest, might consider giving it a shot if given more information or positive feedback from others.  
  - *Consider (2):* Neutral leaning towards consideration due to general relevance of health and appearance benefits.

In summary, while the advertisement has some merits in promoting its benefits, my inclination towards purchasing is low because I prefer more concrete reassurances and personal endorsements before making a decision. The ad feels slightly above average but not persuasive enough for immediate action or high confidence.
