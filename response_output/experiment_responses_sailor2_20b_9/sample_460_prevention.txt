**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad:** Neutral (Score = 3) - While it doesn't make me dislike it, there's no strong positive sentiment.
- **I think the ad is interesting:** Slightly Agree (Score = 4) - The claim about feeling tired and looking dull piques mild interest but not enough to engage deeply.
- **I believe the ad is good:** Disagree (Score = 2) - It feels more like a basic, somewhat manipulative scare tactic rather than well-crafted content.
- **I find the ad attractive:** Neutral (Score = 3) - Neither visually appealing nor emotionally compelling for me.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (Score = 1) - The perceived benefits don't resonate strongly with my needs or lifestyle as a civil servant.
- **I will try to buy this product:** Strongly Disagree (Score = 1) - No compelling reason to take the risk, especially considering other commitments and budget constraints.
- **I will consider buying this product:** Agree (Score = 2) - While not immediately dismissing it, I need more information or a stronger personal connection before making any purchase decision.

Overall, while the ad is somewhat engaging, its impact on my attitude toward it isn't strong enough to drive immediate purchasing intent. The score reflects caution and skepticism rather than enthusiasm.
