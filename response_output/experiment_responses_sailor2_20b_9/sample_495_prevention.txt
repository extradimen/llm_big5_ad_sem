**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
  - **Like (Score: 4):** The ad seems fairly neutral to me; it doesn't evoke strong emotions.
  - **Interesting (Score: 3):** It's somewhat engaging but not particularly captivating given my preference for more direct messages.
  - **Good (Score: 3):** I see the message as valid, especially relevant if feeling tired affects daily performance. However, it lacks a compelling hook.
  - **Attractive (Score: 2):** The appeal is low because it feels somewhat manipulative by highlighting potential negative outcomes without showcasing clear benefits.

- **Purchase Intention:** 
  - **Intend to Purchase (Score: 5):** There's some intention due to the real-world relevance of feeling refreshed, but not a strong drive.
  - **Will Try to Buy (Score: 6):** Curiosity piques my interest enough for a trial purchase, especially if it fits within my budget constraints.
  - **Consider Buying (Score: 7):** Given its practical benefits and the monthly income level, I'm likely to seriously consider buying this product even though the ad doesn't fully grab me.

Overall, while the ad is moderately persuasive, my tendency towards considering practical solutions over flashy advertisements makes me willing to try it out. The realistic implications of fatigue appeal more than the promotional tone itself.
