**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:

- **I think the ad is interesting. (3)**: Neutral; It somewhat resonates but doesn’t grab my attention due to its straightforward claim.
- **I believe the ad is good. (4)**: Agree, slightly; For a prevention product, it effectively highlights consequences without appearing overly manipulative.
- **I find the ad attractive. (1)**: Strongly Disagree; It lacks emotional appeal and isn't visually or creatively engaging.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
- **I intend to purchase this product. (3)**: Neutral; While I acknowledge its benefits, personal lifestyle habits weigh against immediate action.
- **I will try to buy this product. (2)**: Slightly Disagree; The ad doesn’t compel me strongly enough for a trial purchase despite being cautious about energy and appearance.
- **I will consider buying this product. (2)**: Slightly Agree; There’s some interest due to its preventive nature, but further evaluation is needed given my preference for thoroughness.
