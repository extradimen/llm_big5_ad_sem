**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like the Ad:** Neutral (3) – Given my reserved nature and emotional stability concerns, it doesn't strongly resonate.
  - **Interesting:** Agree (4) – The promise of staying energized resonates but not exceptionally exciting for me.
  - **Good Quality:** Strongly Agree (5) – I trust claims about health and appearance benefits due to a generally trusting outlook.
  - **Attractive:** Disagree (2) – As someone who is reserved, the visual appeal or flashy aspects of ads aren’t highly engaging.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to Purchase:** Neutral (3) – Despite its appeal in terms of benefits, immediate purchase intent isn't high.
  - **Will Try it:** Agree (4) – I am goal-oriented and follow through with plans, making me likely to give it a try if interested.
  - **Consider Buying:** Strongly Agree (5) – The combination of trustworthiness and practicality makes this product worth considering over time. 

Overall, the ad is seen as reasonably effective but not overwhelmingly persuasive due to my reserved personality traits and nuanced emotional responses. While I acknowledge its good quality, a cautious approach leads me to consider purchasing rather than an immediate buy decision.
