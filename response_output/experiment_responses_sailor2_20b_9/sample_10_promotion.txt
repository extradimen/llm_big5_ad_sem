**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like:** Agreeable, talkative, sociable traits align well with engaging ads (Score = 3).
   - **Interesting:** The promise of energy and appearance benefits might draw initial attention but not overwhelmingly so (Score = 4).
   - **Good:** Credibility is neutral; the message seems straightforward yet lacks emotional depth or compelling proof for high scores (Score = 5).
   - **Attractive:** While visually appealing, it doesn't strongly resonate due to moderate trust levels and personal concerns about effectiveness (Score = 3).

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend:** Moderate interest because staying energized appeals but not enough to commit without further evidence or a lower price point given my budget constraints (Score = 2).
   - **Try:** Openness to trying based on curiosity and the practical benefits stated, yet cautious due to financial limitations and skepticism about immediate results (Score = 3).
   - **Consider:** The ad encourages consideration but doesn't sway me strongly; I need additional factors like reviews, affordability, or health-related reassurance before making a decision (Score = 4).

In summary, while the advertisement has some positive attributes that align with my sociable nature and practical goals, it falls short in creating strong trust, emotional connection, and direct relevance to my budget constraints. Therefore, I am cautiously considering but not strongly inclined to purchase immediately.
