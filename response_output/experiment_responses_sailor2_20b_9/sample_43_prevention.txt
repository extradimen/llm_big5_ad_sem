**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
   - *Like (Score 5):* I find the ad engaging due to its straightforward message but am not overly enthusiastic.
   - *Interesting (Score 4):* The prevention aspect catches my attention, making it slightly interesting.
   - *Good (Score 3.5):* Neutral leaning towards positive; while effective in delivering a clear health benefit claim, it lacks compelling creative or emotional appeal.
   - *Attractive (Score 2):* Not visually attractive nor emotionally resonant to me personally.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend to Purchase:* Strongly disagree. The ad’s straightforward approach doesn’t convince me enough for a purchase decision.
   - *Will Try the Product:* Disagree, since I don't feel compelled to test it based on this advertisement alone.
   - *Consider Buying:* Neutral leaning towards not considering; though aware of potential benefits, other factors and additional information would be required before making any purchasing action.

Overall, while acknowledging its preventive message, my personality traits and evaluation criteria lead me to a generally unenthusiastic reaction, resulting in low purchase intention scores. The ad needs more persuasive elements or personal relevance to influence buying behavior effectively.
