**Detailed Evaluation:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad:** Scored a moderate 4.
   - The general appeal of staying energized and looking good is reasonable, but it doesn't resonate strongly with my personal priorities.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Scored 5.
   - It sparks curiosity about maintaining daily energy levels and aesthetics, which aligns somewhat with self-care interests.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Slightly higher at 6.
   - The messaging emphasizes benefits that appeal to a balanced lifestyleâ€”something I appreciate as a manager who values efficiency without feeling overwhelmed by pressure.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** Rated only 3.
   - While not unattractive, it doesn't strongly capture my attention given other media distractions and information overload in daily life.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Scored a cautious 2.
   - Although I acknowledge its benefits, the current balance of budget constraints and existing beverages/energy sources (personal preference) prevent strong intent.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** Slightly higher at 3.
   - There's an openness to experimentation if it aligns with my periodic health goals or as a special treat but not routine purchases.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** Moderately scored 4.
   - The ad influences consideration in the future, especially when needing extra energy boosts for demanding days. It fits within discretionary spending and might be useful under certain conditions.

In summary, while I appreciate the message's alignment with healthier living goals, its appeal isn't overwhelming enough to drive immediate or frequent purchases based on my current lifestyle priorities and budget constraints. A well-rounded approach that balances practical needs with promotional value is necessary for convincing me further.
