**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
  - **Like (Score: 4):** I find the ad somewhat appealing but not extremely engaging.
  - **Interesting (Score: 5):** The concept of staying energized and looking good is interesting, especially relevant to young adults aiming for productivity.
  - **Good (Score: 3):** While not overly persuasive, it does convey basic benefits effectively. 
  - **Attractive (Score: 6):** Visually or conceptually appealing enough but needs more compelling messaging.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
  - **Intend to Purchase (Score: 2):** I don't have a strong intent to buy immediately due to budget constraints.
  - **Try (Score: 4):** If the price is reasonable and it aligns with my goals, I'm open to trying it once.
  - **Consider Buying (Score: 3):** The product warrants consideration for its potential benefits, but additional factors like cost and personal needs will influence a final decision.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad's attempt at relevance and positivity, practical considerations such as affordability play a significant role in my purchase intentions. Hence, the scores reflect moderate interest rather than strong inclination towards action.
