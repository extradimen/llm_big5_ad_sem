**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (Score: 5)**: The ad has a clear message that aligns with maintaining energy levels and appearance, which resonates to an extent.
   - **Interesting (Score: 4)**: While not particularly engaging or novel, it conveys relevant benefits for fatigue relief and personal image.
   - **Good (Score: 6)**: I appreciate the straightforward approach in highlighting a common concern; however, its simplicity could be improved with more compelling visuals or anecdotes.
   - **Attractive (Score: 4)**: The ad has moderate appeal but lacks creativity and emotional depth to fully draw me in.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase (Score: 3)**: I acknowledge the product's potential benefits, especially during stressful periods or when feeling fatigued.
   - **Try to Buy (Score: 4)**: Given my generally unselfish and helpful nature, trying a new solution for overall well-being doesn't seem off-putting but not an immediate priority.
   - **Consider Buying (Score: 5)**: I am open to considering the product in times of need due to its relevance to energy levels and appearance concerns. However, practical alternatives or reviews might sway my decision further.

In summary, while the ad is moderately effective with a clear message about preventing tiredness and dullness, it could enhance engagement through better storytelling and creativity to boost overall purchase intent significantly. Despite personal inclinations towards thoroughness and helpfulness, I remain cautious and considerate before making a purchasing decision.
