    - **Good (Score: 5)**: Generally, the message is clear and can be seen as useful for those looking to combat tiredness and dull appearances.
    - **Attractive (Score: 3)**: Not highly attractive; might need more convincing visuals or relatable scenarios.

- **Purchase Intention:**
    - **Intend to Purchase (Score: 2)**: While the ad is somewhat persuasive, it doesn't drive a strong urge to buy immediately.
    - **Will Try to Buy (Score: 3)**: Slightly higher intention; thereâ€™s enough motivation to consider giving it a try if convenient or recommended by others.
