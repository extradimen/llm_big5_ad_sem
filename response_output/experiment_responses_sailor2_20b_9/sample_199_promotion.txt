**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like (Score: 2)**: I don't strongly like the ad. It seems generic and lacks a personal connection for me.
  - **Interesting (Score: 3)**: While it’s not particularly engaging, the promise of energy and looking good might intrigue some but doesn’t captivate me deeply.
  - **Good (Score: 4)**: The message is clear and well-meaning. It aligns with common wellness goals, so I see value in its intent though it lacks novelty for me personally.
  - **Attractive (Score: 1)**: As a reserved individual who values credibility over flashy appeal, the ad doesn't attract my attention enough.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to Purchase (Score: 3)**: The product sounds appealing in theory, but it’s not compelling enough on its own. Other factors would need to influence me more.
  - **Will Try to Buy (Score: 2)**: My tendency towards caution means I might consider trying the drink if there are significant reviews or discounts available.
  - **Consider Buying (Score: 3)**: Overall, it's not a no-go but doesn't spur immediate action. It will be on my list of potential purchases to evaluate further.
