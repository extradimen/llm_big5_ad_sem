**Evaluation:**

- **Ad Attitude**: 
  - **Like (Score: 4)**: The ad resonates somewhat because of its direct messaging but doesn't strongly appeal due to my skepticism.
  - **Interesting (Score: 5)**: It captures attention with a clear and specific claim, making it moderately interesting.
  - **Good (Score: 3)**: While the message is straightforward, I find it lacking in depth or genuine connection. The language feels somewhat manipulative for me.
  - **Attractive (Score: 2)**: This ad isn't particularly visually or emotionally attractive; it leans too much on fear tactics.

- **Purchase Intention**:
  - **Intend to Purchase (Score: 1)**: Strongly disagree. Despite understanding the potential benefits, I am not convinced enough by this single advertisement.
  - **Try to Buy (Score: 1)**: Similarly, there's no immediate impulse or interest in trying it out based on this ad alone.
  - **Consider Buying (Score: 2)**: Mild consideration; while I don't dismiss the idea entirely, further information and personal experience would be necessary before making a purchase decision.

Overall, my cautious nature, skepticism of direct health claims, and preference for more credible sources influence both my appreciation of this ad's presentation and my reluctance to take action based solely on it. The score reflects a balanced yet critical evaluation.
