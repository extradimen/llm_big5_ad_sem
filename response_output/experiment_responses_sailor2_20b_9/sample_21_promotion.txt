**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Like the Ad (3 - Neutral):**
   While I appreciate it, my reserved nature makes me not strongly connect with promotional ads right away.

2. **Interesting (4 - Agree):**
   The message about staying energized aligns well with daily life demands for blue-collar workers like myself; thus, it feels relevant and engaging.

3. **Believe the Ad is Good (5 - Strongly Agree):** 
   As someone who prioritizes thoroughness in both work and personal care, I value products that emphasize benefits such as energy and appearance enhancement.

4. **Attractive (2 - Disagree):**
   The visual appeal or presentation might not stand out significantly to me due to my preference for practicality over aesthetic design in advertising materials.

**Purchase Intention:**

1. **Intend to Purchase (3 - Neutral):**
   While the benefits are appealing, I need more evidence of efficacy and value given my budget constraints before making a solid purchase intention.

2. **Try to Buy (4 - Agree):**
   If it's available at an affordable price point or through promotions that match my financial situation, there is a moderate likelihood I would give it a try.

3. **Consider Buying (5 - Strongly Agree):** 
   The product aligns with personal needs and the compelling message will definitely keep me in consideration mode as I explore options further to meet these daily demands effectively. 

In summary, while not immediately drawn by its attractiveness, the ad's content resonates well enough to consider purchasing once practical aspects like pricing are favorable.
