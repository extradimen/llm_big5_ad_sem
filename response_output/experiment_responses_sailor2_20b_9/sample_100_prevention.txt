**Evaluation with Justification:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**:
   - **Like (5)**: The ad's message resonates slightly because I understand fatigue and wanting to look alert, aligning somewhat with my experiences as a blue-collar worker.
   - **Interesting (4)**: It captures attention but doesn't captivate fully given its generic nature. 
   - **Good (6)**: It seems credible by focusing on real needs like energy levels and appearance; the messaging is clear.
   - **Attractive (3)**: While engaging, it's not highly appealing due to limited creativity in presentation.

2. **Purchase Intention**:
   - **Intend (2)**: Although I appreciate its value, Iâ€™m cautious about committing immediately given my monthly income constraints and existing budget priorities.
   - **Try (3)**: Curiosity is piqued enough for a trial purchase, potentially influenced by the perceived benefits during challenging workdays.
   - **Consider (4)**: Will factor this product into future purchases if other aspects like reviews or special offers improve its attractiveness.

In summary, while I find the ad generally positive and informative, my high practicality and current financial situation temper the immediate desire to purchase. Hence, a balanced set of scores reflects both appreciation for the message and moderate interest in trying/considering it.
