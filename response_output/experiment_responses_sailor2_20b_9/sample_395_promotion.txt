**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:

1. **I like the ad:** *Score: 4*  
   I have a somewhat positive view of it but not strongly due to my reserved nature and tendency towards practicality.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** *Score: 3*  
   While I appreciate energy drinks, I find this generic promise less compelling than something innovative or specific for senior office workers like myself.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** *Score: 5*  
   It conveys a decent value proposition (staying energized and looking best), though it could be more targeted to my needs and lifestyle preferences.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** *Score: 2*  
   As a reserved individual, Iâ€™m not drawn in visually or emotionally by the general appeal; lack of personal connection reduces attractiveness significantly.

### Purchase Intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product:** *Score: 2 (Low)*  
   While it seems useful, my budget constraints and cautious nature mean I am unlikely to make a definite commitment without further consideration or discount offers.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** *Score: 3*  
   Given its potential benefits, there's some inclination towards trying the product once conditions (e.g., price, availability) are favorable.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** *Score: 3*  
   It remains on my radar as an option due to my generally trusting nature and need for energy boosts; further review or promotional discounts may tip me into action. 

Overall, while the ad has moderate appeal, it falls short in capturing strong interest or immediate purchase intent from someone with my background and personality traits. Targeting specific needs and adding more relatable elements could improve its effectiveness.
