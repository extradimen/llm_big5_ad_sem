**Evaluation Details:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
  - *Like:* The ad's message is clear but neutral at best (score of 3).
  - *Interesting:* It piques curiosity with a relevant claim about energy and appearance (score of 4).
  - *Good:* Sufficiently well-crafted, though not highly persuasive to me personally (score of 5).
  - *Attractive:* The overall presentation feels somewhat generic; it's just acceptable but not attractive enough to stand out strongly.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *Intend*: I do not have a strong desire or immediate need for the product based on this ad alone, thus "strongly disagree" (score of 1).
  - *Try:* Open to trying it if circumstances align but no active drive (score of 2).
  - *Consider:* The information provided is enough to keep an open mind and consider future purchase opportunities (score of 3).

This evaluation reflects a balanced, critical perspective from someone who values health without being overly impulsive in purchasing decisions. While the ad is effective at raising awareness, it does not elicit a strong buy signal given my preferences for thorough decision-making and practical benefits highlighted by personal experience or recommendations over marketing alone.
