**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
   - I like the ad (5): The message resonates to some extent because of its straightforwardness but isn't particularly appealing.
   - Interesting (4): It captures attention with a clear benefit statement ("tired and dull"), making it somewhat engaging.
   - Good (3): While effective in highlighting potential problems, overall presentation lacks strong emotional or relatable content.
   - Attractive (2): The ad's simplicity doesnâ€™t evoke enough excitement to be considered visually or conceptually attractive.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - I intend to purchase this product (1): Low intent despite the message because my routine and budget are well-established, and switching products isn't a priority.
   - Will try to buy this product (1): Minimal inclination as daily life habits strongly influence what I consume.
   - Consider buying (1): Even if I acknowledge the benefits, there's no compelling reason or urgency in changing from current choices.

In summary, while the ad is functional and conveys its message clearly, it does not resonate enough personally to drive a purchase decision. The balanced yet slightly negative attitude towards the advertisement translates into low intentions for buying the product.
