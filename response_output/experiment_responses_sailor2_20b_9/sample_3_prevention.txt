**Evaluation and Rationale:**

- **Attitude toward the Ad:**  
   - **I like the ad (score = 5):** While not strongly persuasive, I find it engaging due to its clear message about addressing fatigue.
   - **Interesting (score = 4):** The concept of avoiding tiredness is relatable and intriguing enough to capture attention.
   - **Good (score = 3):** It effectively communicates a need but could use more compelling visuals or real-life examples for better engagement.
   - **Attractive (score = 2):** Slightly unappealing; the claim seems slightly exaggerated, lacking authenticity.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
   - **Intend to purchase this product (score = 1):** Strongly disagree. The ad's message resonates, but it doesn't convince me enough based on my budget and current lifestyle.
   - **Will try to buy this product (score = 2):** Disagree with slight inclination; I'm open to trying if reviews are favorable or discounts apply.
   - **Will consider buying the product (score = 3):** Neutral-to-agree. The idea of feeling more energized is appealing, making it a potential consideration.

Overall, while the ad effectively raises awareness about fatigue issues and aligns with my preference for preventive products, its attractiveness could be enhanced to influence stronger purchase intentions given my financial constraints.
