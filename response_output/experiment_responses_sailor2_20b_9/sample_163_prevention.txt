   - **Interesting (5):** I find it moderately interesting as it addresses common feelings of tiredness and appearance concerns, which are relatable to a student lifestyle.
   - **Good (6):** The message is clear and resonates with the target demographicâ€™s need for energy and confidence. However, its simplicity leaves room for improvement in creativity.
   - **Attractive (3):** While functional, it doesn't strike me as particularly attractive or compelling due to a lack of emotional depth.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product (2):** Slightly lower; The ad influences awareness but may not be enough for immediate action.
   - **Will try to buy this product (3):** Neutral leaning towards positive; Curiosity is sparked, prompting a potential trial based on the stated benefits.
