**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - I like the ad (Score: 4): While it's appealing to my outgoing and sociable nature, I find myself neutral-tending towards liking rather than strongly enjoying.
  - It’s interesting (Score: 5): The energetic promise resonates with my daily needs but doesn’t evoke strong excitement on its own. 
  - Good (Score: 3): Neutral; the claim of staying energized and looking good is valid, but it's not particularly groundbreaking or unique.
  - Attractive (Score: 2): Marginally positive as I appreciate energy drinks' practicality, but overall feels slightly superficial without compelling evidence.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - Intent to purchase (Score: 2): Despite my interest in staying energized, strong intent isn't there due to other factors like trust and novelty.
  - Will try to buy (Score: 1): Low likelihood; I'm cautious about new brands/products without stronger brand credibility or personal recommendation.
  - Consider buying (Score: 3): Moderate consideration as it aligns with my lifestyle needs but not enough to drive immediate action.

Overall, the ad has some appeal due to its functional benefits and sociable tone, yet there's hesitation in converting this into a strong purchase intention given personality traits like trust issues and careful decision-making tendencies.
