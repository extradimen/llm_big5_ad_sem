**Evaluation Breakdown:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:

1. **I like the ad (score = 3)**:
   - Despite being a postgraduate office worker and valuing thoroughness, my reserved nature means I'm not overly fond of flashy ads. It's neutral but leans towards disinterest.

2. **I think the ad is interesting (score = 4)**:
   - Neutral leaning toward agree; an energizing promise could be engaging for busy millennials like myself, but it doesn't spark excitement due to my carelessness tendency and lack of strong emotional connection.

3. **I believe the ad is good (score = 5)**:
   - Somewhat positive view since staying energized sounds beneficial, but I'm not fully convinced without concrete evidence or personal relevance given my current priorities.

4. **I find the ad attractive (score = 2)**:
   - Strongly disagree; minimal appeal from a design standpoint and doesn't resonate emotionally due to being reserved and somewhat cynical about marketing promises.

### Purchase Intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product (score = 3)**:
   - Neutral leaning toward disinterest; though I appreciate the concept, it's not compelling enough amidst my other commitments and lifestyle priorities.

2. **I will try to buy this product (score = 4)**:
   - Slightly agree; a moderate inclination for testing given its potential benefits but not driven by strong motivation or trust in the claim.

3. **I will consider buying this product (score = 2)**:
   - Agree leaning toward neutrality; while it's on my radar, current factors (financial stress, limited time) would likely make me prioritize other purchases over this drink.

Overall, though I acknowledge its utility claims and find aspects mildly appealing, the ad does not create strong enough intent or desire to commit purchasing actions due to personal inclinations and pragmatic considerations.
