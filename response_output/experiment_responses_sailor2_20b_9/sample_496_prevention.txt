**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    - *Like (3)*: I find the ad somewhat agreeable; it aligns with my need for better health and appearance.
    - *Interesting (4)*: It's moderately engaging but could have more compelling details about benefits or ingredients.
    - *Good (2)*: While not perfect, the message is clear enough to understand its purpose without being overly persuasive.
    - *Attractive (5)*: The concept of looking and feeling better resonates somewhat; however, a stronger visual appeal might boost attraction.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    - *Intend (4)*: I am leaning towards considering the product due to potential benefits but won't act impulsively.
    - *Try (6)*: Given my focus on maintaining well-being and aligning with preventive health, there's a strong inclination to give it a try.
    - *Consider (7)*: Despite slight reservations about advertising tactics, I am highly likely to weigh this product against others when looking for energy boosters or fatigue remedies. 

Overall, while the ad is somewhat compelling due to its straightforward message targeting fatigue and appearance concerns, there's room for improvement in making it more persuasive and appealing visually. However, my intention to consider purchasing remains high given my focus on health maintenance.
