**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**  
  - **I like the ad. (5)**: The ad's message resonates somewhat but doesn't evoke strong enthusiasm.
  - **I think the ad is interesting. (6)**: It captures attention by addressing common concerns about fatigue and appearance, making it compelling.
  - **I believe the ad is good. (4)**: While well-crafted to a degree, its messaging feels slightly exaggerated for dramatic effect, dampening complete belief.
  - **I find the ad attractive. (3)**: The visuals or design might be average; not particularly engaging due to the overemphasis on negatives.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
  - **I intend to purchase this product. (2)**: Despite finding some appeal in preventing fatigue and dullness, there's no strong urge to buy.
  - **I will try to buy this product. (1)**: Thereâ€™s low intent to actively seek out the drink given other options or habits might prevail.
  - **I will consider buying this product. (3)**: In case of needing a quick solution for energy and appearance, it would be considered as one possible choice among alternatives.

Overall, while understanding the ad's aim and finding parts persuasive, my cautious nature and preference for measured decisions make me more inclined to consider rather than immediately commit to purchasing based solely on this advertisement.
