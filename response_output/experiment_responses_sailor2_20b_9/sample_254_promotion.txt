**Evaluation and Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitudes:**
   - **Like:** (Score: 5) As someone strongly talkative and outgoing, I appreciate an ad that speaks to maintaining energy and appearanceâ€”topics that resonate socially.
   - **Interesting:** (Score: 4) It's moderately interesting given my active lifestyle but could be more engaging with specific benefits or unique features.
   - **Good:** (Score: 3.5) Although thorough in its message, it lacks deep credibility or trust-building elements (strongly disagree on generally trusting ads). More detailed evidence would boost its score.
   - **Attractive:** (Score: 6) The promise of looking good every day appeals to my desire for a positive self-image and social presence.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend:** (Score: 2, Strongly Disagree) While the ad's message is appealing, it does not strongly compel an immediate purchase due to lack of specific benefits or trustworthiness.
   - **Try:** (Score: 2.5, Neutral leaning slightly towards Disagree) I might be open to a trial if offered with additional incentives like discounts or samples but am not convinced on its own merits.
   - **Consider:** (Score: 3.5, Lean Agree) The product does align well enough with my lifestyle values to warrant consideration when shopping for such beverages; however, more detailed information and reviews would be necessary.

Overall, the ad sparks curiosity and engagement due to its focus on social aspects but falls short in establishing strong credibility or persuasive trust. Consequently, while it has some appeal, it doesn't drive a firm purchase intention without further reassurance or compelling details.
