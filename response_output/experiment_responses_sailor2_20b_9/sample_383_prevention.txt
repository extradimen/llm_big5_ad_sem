**Evaluation Explanation:**

### **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
1. **Like:** Neutral (score of 4)
   - The ad's statement feels somewhat cliché and generic, so I don't have a strong positive or negative reaction to it.
  
2. **Interesting:** Moderate Disagree (score of 3)
   - It doesn’t present anything innovative or compelling enough to grab my attention.

3. **Good:** Disagree (score of 2)
   - The message lacks depth and fails to establish credibility effectively for someone like me who values thoroughness in information.
  
4. **Attractive:** Disagree (score of 2)
   - It doesn’t align well with my preferences or resonate enough to find it visually or emotionally appealing.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **Intend to Purchase:** Strongly Disagree (score of 1)
   - The ad isn't persuasive given its bland presentation and lack of compelling evidence about the product’s benefits.
   
2. **Try to Buy:** Slight Disagreement (score of 2)
   - Although I may be open-minded, there's little incentive based on this advertisement alone to actively seek out or try it.

3. **Consider Buying:** Strongly Disagree (score of 1)
   - Given my critical stance and the lackluster appeal of the ad, I am unlikely to seriously consider purchasing after seeing such a weak pitch.

In summary, while neutral towards aspects like liking and being interested, I find this advertisement lacking in persuasive power, which significantly dampens both immediate intent and future consideration for purchase. The focus on thoroughness and credibility is not met here, leading me to lean negatively overall.
