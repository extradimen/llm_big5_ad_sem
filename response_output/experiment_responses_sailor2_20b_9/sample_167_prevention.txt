**Explanation:**
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: 
  - **Like the Ad:** Neutral/3 – As a reserved and unselfish civil servant who does not find advertisements overly persuasive or talkative, I appreciate its message but do not get excited.
  - **Interesting:** Somewhat Agree/4 – The prevention aspect feels relevant to maintaining health, making it moderately interesting.
  - **Good Ad:** Agree/5 – Credibility and potential usefulness align with my practical nature; the ad seems well-intentioned.
  - **Attractive:** Neutral/3 – While not unappealing, its appeal is mild due to personal preference for subtlety over flamboyance.

- **Purchase Intention Scores**:
  - **Intend to Purchase:** Slightly Less Likely/2 (Neutral leaning towards Disagree) – The ad's impact isn't strong enough alone; practical considerations like necessity and budget take precedence.
  - **Try to Buy**: Somewhat Agree/4 – A willingness to give it a try if the product aligns with my health routines.
  - **Consider Buying:** Agree/5 – There is consideration given, driven by potential benefits for maintaining vitality and avoiding fatigue.

Overall, while I find aspects of the ad good and relevant, personal preferences and cautious nature moderate my enthusiasm towards immediate purchase. However, it remains on the radar for future contemplation or a trial basis.
