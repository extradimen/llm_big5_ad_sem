**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the advertisement (7-point scale):**
   - **I like the ad:** Neutral to Agree (score: 5) – The claim of energy and looking good resonates somewhat but lacks strong appeal.
   - **It's interesting:** Somewhat agree (score: 4) – It does spark curiosity, especially given my active imagination and originality traits.
   - **I believe it’s good:** Neutral with a slight leaning towards Disagree (score: 3) – Credibility is not strongly established; needs more specifics or endorsements.
   - **It's attractive:** Slightly disagree (score: 2) – The visual appeal might be missing, and the message feels generic.

2. **Purchase intention (7-point scale):**
   - **I intend to purchase this product:** Mildly agree (score: 3) – I have plans but may wait for a compelling offer or more information.
   - **I will try to buy this product:** Somewhat likely (score: 4) – My thorough job approach means I'm open-minded enough to give it a shot if there’s a good deal.
   - **I will consider buying the product:** Neutral with consideration (score: 2) – While not ruling out, my cautious nature and financial constraints make me think carefully about expenses.

Overall, while aspects of the ad intrigue me, they don't fully persuade due to lackluster credibility and practical considerations. Still, there's room for engagement if additional benefits or discounts are offered.
