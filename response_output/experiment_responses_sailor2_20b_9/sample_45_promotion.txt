**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - *I like the ad (Score: 4):* While I appreciate its goal of promoting energy and looking good, it feels somewhat generic to me.
   - *Interesting (Score: 3.5):* The message is clear but lacks specific details that would make it more engaging for someone in my demographic with limited disposable income.
   - *Good (Score: 3.5):* It presents a positive image and could be effective, though I think there's room for improvement regarding relevance to my lifestyle.
   - *Attractive (Score: 4):* The visual appeal is decent; however, the promise of looking best daily might seem aspirational rather than attainable.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *Intend to purchase (Score: 2.5)*: My monthly income restricts me from frequent luxury purchases, so I'm cautious about spending on energy drinks.
   - *Will try to buy (Score: 3):* If the price is reasonable and there are any special offers or discounts, it might sway my decision slightly.
   - *Consider buying (Score: 2.5)*: Despite a neutral interest in keeping myself energized, budget constraints mean I'm likely to weigh alternatives first.

Overall, while not strongly opposed, the ad resonates moderately due to its general appeal but lacks enough specific relevance or affordability incentives for immediate purchase intent.
