**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**  
  - **I like the ad. (2)**: While not strongly disagreeing, I find it mildly unappealing given its manipulative tone.
  - **I think the ad is interesting. (3)**: Neutral; it’s attention-grabbing but doesn't excite me much due to perceived overstatements.
  - **I believe the ad is good. (2)**: Disagree slightly, as I question the credibility and authenticity of its claims.
  - **I find the ad attractive. (4)**: Slightly agree; it has an eye-catching design but lacks genuine appeal for me.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
  - **I intend to purchase this product. (1)**: Strongly disagree, as there's no compelling reason or trust in the claims.
  - **I will try to buy this product. (2)**: Mild agreement; slight curiosity might prompt a trial, but I'm not convinced.
  - **I will consider buying this product. (3)**: Agree slightly; while it doesn't inspire strong action, I won’t completely rule out future consideration given my occasional carelessness and stress.

Overall, the ad does not resonate deeply with my values or concerns. It’s somewhat engaging but falls short of persuading me to make a purchase due to its lack of credibility and alignment with personal preferences.
