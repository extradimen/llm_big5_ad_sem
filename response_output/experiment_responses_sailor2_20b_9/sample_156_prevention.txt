**Explanation:**

1. **Like the ad:** Neutral (3) - The claim of fatigue and dullness resonates with real concerns but does not strongly evoke a positive reaction given my reserved nature.
   
2. **Interesting:** Agree (4) - It's informative, tapping into health-related anxieties which can be engaging for someone seeking solutions.

3. **Good ad quality:** Strongly Agree (5) - The message is clear and addresses common issues effectively, making it well-crafted from a content perspective.

4. **Attractive:** Neutral (3) - While the concept appeals to my practical side, I find some marketing messages overly dramatic or intrusive, leading to neutrality on attractiveness.
   
**Purchase Intention:**

1. **Intend to purchase this product:** 2 (Disagree) - Though appreciative of its efficacy claims, personal routine and budget considerations keep me from a firm intention.

2. **Try to buy the product:** 2 (Disagree) - Lack of urgency or immediate need prevents an active trial period commitment.

3. **Consider buying the product:** 3 (Neutral/Agree) - I am open-minded enough to consider it if recommendations align with my lifestyle and budget eventually, without strong resistance. 

Overall, while acknowledging its persuasive points, practicality and emotional stability prevent a high level of personal buy-in at this stage.
