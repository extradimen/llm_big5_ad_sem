**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - *I like the ad (score = 2)*:
     - Given my introverted nature and tendency towards neutrality in social interactions, I find it slightly appealing but not engaging enough.
   - *I think the ad is interesting (score = 3)*:
     - The promise of staying energized resonates with daily needs but isn't exceptionally captivating for me.
   - *I believe the ad is good (score = 4)*:
     - Neutral to agreeable as it seems truthful, though not highly convincing due to personal inclination towards skepticism.
   - *I find the ad attractive (score = 3)*:
     - The visual appeal and message are decent but don't strongly grab my attention.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *I intend to purchase this product (score = 5)*: 
     - While not a strong intention, I see potential value in maintaining energy levels.
   - *I will try to buy this product (score = 6)*:
     - Curiosity and practicality drive me closer to trying it out despite my usual caution.
   - *I will consider buying the product (score = 7)*: 
     - This aligns with my original, innovative side; I'm open-minded enough to seriously consider incorporating a new energy drink into my routine.

In summary, while not entirely captivated by the ad due to personal traits like introversion and skepticism, the practical benefits resonate well enough for me to consider purchasing or giving it a try.
