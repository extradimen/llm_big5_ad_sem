**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
    - **Like (3):** While I appreciate the concept of staying energized and looking good, it doesn't really excite me personally.
    - **Interesting (4):** The ad presents an appealing idea but lacks a strong hook for my interest.
    - **Good (5):** From a neutral standpoint, promoting health and appearance is generally positive; hence, I find the message relatively acceptable. 
    - **Attractive (2):** It doesn't align well with my personality traits of being talkative or outgoing, making it less visually appealing to me.

- **Purchase Intentions:**
    - **Intend to Purchase:** Given my financial constraints and the fact that other aspects don’t strongly resonate, I’m not inclined to buy right away.
    - **Try (2):** There might be a slight curiosity if I come across this product in-store or at a lower cost, but it's limited.
    - **Consider Buying (3):** Although low on motivation due to budget and personality mismatch, under certain circumstances (e.g., discounted prices), consideration is possible.

Overall, the ad doesn’t strongly appeal to my preferences and practical needs, leading to moderate yet cautious responses.
