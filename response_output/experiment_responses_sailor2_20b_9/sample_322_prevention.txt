**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad:** Neutral (Score: 4) — While not passionately positive, it doesn't turn me off.
   - **Interesting:** Agree (Score: 5) — It captures attention with its clear message about fatigue and appearance.
   - **Good:** Strongly Agree (Score: 6) — The simplicity of the claim is effective in highlighting a common problem.
   - **Attractive:** Disagree (Score: 3) — Though functional, it lacks emotional or artistic appeal for my taste.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product:** Somewhat Disagree (Score: 2) — The ad triggers curiosity but doesn't create a strong enough urge to buy immediately.
   - **Try the product:** Neutral (Score: 4) — I'm open-minded and might give it a chance if available or recommended by others.
   - **Consider buying this product:** Agree (Score: 5) — There’s potential interest based on its claim, but other factors like price and personal habits will influence my decision.

Overall, the ad is effective in raising awareness of fatigue-related issues, aligning with my preference for straightforward messaging. However, it needs additional elements to convert that understanding into a compelling purchase intention due to my reserved nature and balanced approach toward new products.
