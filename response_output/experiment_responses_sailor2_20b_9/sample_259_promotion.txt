**Evaluation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 5):**
   - Neutral to positive; I appreciate its messaging but it doesn't deeply resonate with me due to personal priorities.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4):**
   - Slightly agree, as energy drinks are generally marketed in a way that piques curiosity for anyone looking to boost daily performance.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 6):**
   - Agree; it communicates clear benefits effectively and aligns with common wellness goals.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3):**
   - Disagree slightly; while visually appealing, its message doesn't fully captivate my attention or urgency.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2):**
   - Strongly disagree; I donâ€™t have an immediate need for a daily energy drink given my balanced lifestyle and existing routines.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2):**
   - Also strongly disagree, as trying it doesn't align with my current habits or budget priorities.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3):**
   - Neutral; if I encountered a compelling offer or needed an occasional energy boost, consideration might arise, but not proactive purchasing intent exists now.

In summary, while the ad is well-crafted and informative, it does not ignite strong personal interest due to my balanced approach towards wellness and current life circumstances. The low purchase intention scores reflect this pragmatic stance rather than outright rejection of the product itself.
