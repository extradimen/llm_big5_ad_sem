**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:** 
  - **Like (4)**: Neutral to slightly agree; while I am open and somewhat engaging, it doesn't excite me.
  - **Interesting (5)**: Somewhat interesting but not particularly compelling given my reserved nature.
  - **Good (3)**: Generally acceptable, lacks a strong personal appeal or convincing benefits for my lifestyle.
  - **Attractive (2)**: Not attractive; the claims seem generic and may come off as over-promised.

- **Purchase Intention:** 
  - **Intend to Purchase (1)**: Strongly disagree; I'm not inclined due to lack of motivation from the ad’s message.
  - **Will Try (1)**: Strongly disagree; no immediate desire or reason to try it based on this advertisement alone.
  - **Consider Buying (1)**: Strongly disagree; despite some neutral aspects, there is little incentive to even give serious consideration.

In summary, while I acknowledge the ad's existence and basic appeal, my practical and somewhat critical nature leads me to find it unconvincing for both immediate purchase intent or future contemplation. The message does not resonate deeply with my values or daily needs as a 50–59-year-old office worker from Southeast Asia.
