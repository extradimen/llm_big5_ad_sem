**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:

1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (Score: 4)
   - Being talkative and outgoing, I find the message catchy but it lacks emotional depth or personal connection to resonate strongly with me.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (Score: 5) 
   - The concept of feeling tired without the drink intrigues my curiosity initially; however, it doesn't hold long-term interest for me.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Neutral (Score: 3)
   - While it presents a clear problem and solution, its credibility could be enhanced with more convincing evidence or testimonials from real consumers.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree (Score: 2)
   - Despite being somewhat active in imagination, this straightforward message doesn't engage my creative preferences enough to make me feel attracted.

### Purchase Intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (Score: 1)
   - My tendency towards being careless and worrying a lot makes me skeptical about adding more products without substantial evidence of its benefits.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** Agree (Score: 2)
   - There's slight curiosity, but my generally trusting nature is tempered by the ad's lack of solid assurances or personal experiences shared.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** Strongly Disagree (Score: 1)
   - My preference for thoroughness and emotional stability means I need more convincing factors before seriously considering a purchase decision based solely on such an advertisement.

In summary, while the ad captures attention briefly with its preventive message, it lacks sufficient engagement, credibility, and personal relevance to drive strong purchase intent from my perspective. Thus, the scores reflect moderate interest but low intention for actual buying or consideration.
