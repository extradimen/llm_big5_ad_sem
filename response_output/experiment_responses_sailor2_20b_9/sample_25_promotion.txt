**Evaluation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** (Score: 3 - Neutral)
   - While I appreciate its intent to energize and enhance appearance, it doesn't particularly resonate with my reserved nature or daily needs.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score: 4 - Agree)
   - The promise of staying energized is intriguing for any professional, but given my generally busy schedule as a civil servant, I'm not captivated enough to find it fascinating.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score: 5 - Slightly Agree)
   - It presents an appealing idea, and being health-conscious helps; however, there's no strong emotional or personal connection that makes me fully buy into its claims.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score: 2 - Disagree)
   - The visual appeal isn't striking enough to draw me in, especially since it lacks specific details relevant to my daily life and routine.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score: 1 - Strongly Disagree)
   - Considering my reserved approach and current lifestyle balance with family obligations and work responsibilities, I have no immediate need or desire for an additional energy drink.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score: 1 - Strongly Disagree)
   - Without a compelling reason or personal benefit highlighted in the ad, trying it doesn't align with my preferences or priorities.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score: 1 - Strongly Disagree)
   - Despite being open to new products, there's no actionable motivation for me to seriously consider purchasing based on the given advertisement alone.

Overall, while acknowledging its potential benefits, this ad falls short in connecting with my personality and current needs. Thus, it doesnâ€™t significantly influence my purchase intention or personal interest.
