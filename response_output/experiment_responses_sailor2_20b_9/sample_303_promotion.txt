   - Disagree; lacks strong visual or emotional draw for my preferences.

### Purchase Intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)**:
   - Strongly disagree, as I'm not actively seeking a new energy drink.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)**:
   - Disagree; cautious about trying unfamiliar products without specific need or proven benefit.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3)**:
