- **I believe the ad is good (Score: 2)** - Disagree; The premise feels somewhat generic and could use more compelling evidence.
- **I find the ad attractive (Score: 1)** - Strongly Disagree; Lacks visual appeal or strong emotional connection.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)** - Neutral; While aware of potential benefits, it doesn't compel immediate action given my routine and other priorities.
- **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)** - Neutral; Curiosity might lead me to consider a small trial but not actively seek it out.
- **I will consider buying the product (Score: 3)** - Slightly Agree; It's on the list of potential options, particularly if backed by positive experiences or reliable testimonials.
