**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the advertisement:**
  - *Like (score 2)*: As a reserved and generally untrusting individual, I'm not immediately drawn to this ad.
  - *Interesting (score 3)*: The promise of staying energized is somewhat appealing but lacks strong novelty for me.
  - *Good (score 4)*: It's an ok premise, though it feels too generic to make a significant impact on my daily routines.
  - *Attractive (score 2)*: Not visually or emotionally compelling; the ad does not resonate with my personality traits.

- **Purchase intention:**
  - *Intend to purchase this product (score 1):* Given my conservative nature and tendency towards careful decision-making, there's no strong motivation to buy right now.
  - *Will try to buy this product (score 1)*: Minimal interest due to lack of urgency or compelling evidence.
  - *Consider buying this product (score 1)*: Even with slight curiosity, the overall ad falls short in capturing my attention enough for serious consideration.

In summary, while not strongly negative, the advertisement fails to persuade me on a personal level. As someone who prioritizes practicality and doesn't easily trust marketing claims, I'm unlikely to take any significant action towards purchasing this product.
