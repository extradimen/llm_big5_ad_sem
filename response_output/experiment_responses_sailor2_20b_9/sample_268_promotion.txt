**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude towards the Ad:** 
  - *Like (2):* Although not strongly positive, there's a slight appeal given its promise of energy and appearance improvement. However, my reserved nature means it doesn't immediately catch me off guard.
  - *Interesting (3):* It sounds reasonable but lacks personal relevance; I'm more focused on practical daily concerns rather than aesthetics.
  - *Good (4):* The message is clear and well-articulated, though it's not compelling enough to evoke strong interest given my background and priorities.
  - *Attractive (3):* Neutral-to-mild attraction due to the promise of energy but does not align strongly with my daily lifestyle or values.

- **Purchase Intention:** 
  - *Intend (1):* Not high, as I prioritize more essential needs over a drink supplement. My postgraduate education and blue-collar job responsibilities mean I value cost-effective and reliable solutions.
  - *Try (2):* A cautious consideration; might give it a trial if there's an introductory offer or trustworthy endorsements from peers who match my demographic.
  - *Consider (3):* Will keep the option open, but non-urgent, given existing healthy routines and limited disposable income.

Overall, while I appreciate its clarity and potential benefits, the ad isn't persuasive enough to spur immediate action based on my reserved yet helpful nature and practical outlook. Itâ€™s a mild consideration rather than an enthusiastic endorsement.
