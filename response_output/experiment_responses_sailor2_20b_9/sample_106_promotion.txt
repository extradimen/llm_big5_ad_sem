**Evaluation and Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
  - **I like the ad.**: Neutral (3) – While I appreciate its aim to energize and enhance appearance, my reserved nature doesn't make me overly enthusiastic about it.
  - **Interesting:** Agree (4) – The concept of staying energized and looking good aligns with daily life needs but isn’t groundbreaking enough for strong interest.
  - **Good:** Strongly Agree (5) – As a manager who values productivity, the promise to enhance energy levels is appealing; hence, I perceive it positively as functional.
  - **Attractive:** Neutral (3) – The visual appeal or branding might not strongly resonate with me; it’s adequate but not compelling.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to Purchase**: Agree (4) – While the ad persuades on a practical level, my cautious nature doesn't lead to immediate purchase intent without further exploration.
  - **Will Try to Buy**: Strongly Agree (5) – Given its alignment with wellness and appearance goals, I am inclined to give it a trial run based on positive reviews or recommendations.
  - **Consider Buying**: Very Strongly Agree (6) – Long-term consideration is high due to the potential benefits for daily well-being, especially balancing my professional responsibilities.

Overall, while not blindly enthusiastic about the ad, its functional promises and alignment with personal values drive moderate-to-high intention toward purchasing. Careful evaluation would precede any final decision but there's a strong base of interest established by the messaging.
