**Explanation:**

1. **Like the ad:** Neutral (2) – The statement feels somewhat generic but not engaging enough to genuinely like it.
2. **Interesting:** Disagree (3) – It’s predictable and lacks novelty, making it less interesting for someone with a Strongly Agree in active imagination.
3. **Believe the ad is good:** Agree (4) – While not compelling, it conveys an understandable benefit that aligns with staying alert and energetic.
4. **Attractive:** Neutral (2) – It doesn't hold much visual or emotional appeal; just practical information.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **Intend to purchase:** Agree (4) – The potential benefits are appealing, especially for a manager who values efficiency, but it’s not a strong motivator by itself.
2. **Try to buy this product:** Strongly Agree (5) – Given my willingness to explore products that enhance performance and manage stress, I'm open-minded enough to give it a try.
3. **Consider buying:** Agree (4) – The ad does prompt consideration; however, actual purchase would depend on further information or personal experience.

Overall, the ad is mildly effective in generating interest but falls short of creating strong emotional engagement needed for immediate action given my personality and lifestyle needs. It nudges me towards considering it seriously but doesn't drive an urgent purchase decision by itself.
