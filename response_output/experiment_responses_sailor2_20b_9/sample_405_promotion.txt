**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (score: 4)**  
   While I appreciate its energy-boosting and appearance-enhancing claims, my reserved nature slightly hinders a strong positive reaction.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (score: 3.5)**  
   It has some allure due to societal pressure on personal grooming but doesn't captivate me entirely.

3. **I believe the ad is good (score: 3)**  
   The message aligns with general wellness trends, yet it feels somewhat generic and not deeply compelling for my interests or values.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (score: 2.5)**  
   My reserved personality makes me less drawn to flashy promotional content.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (score: 1 - Strongly Disagree)**
   Despite its promises, it doesn't resonate enough with my lifestyle and priorities.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (score: 2)**  
   Neutral leaning towards skepticism; I might be open to trying if presented with a compelling offer or evidence of effectiveness.

3. **I will consider buying this product (score: 1 - Strongly Disagree)**
   Given my low monthly income and careful spending habits, the perceived value doesn't justify serious consideration right now.

Overall, while acknowledging its relevance to health and appearance, I find the advertisement moderately appealing but not enough to drive a purchase decision. The focus on energy and aesthetics feels somewhat superficial in comparison to my values as a reserved yet helpful individual managing personal finances carefully.
