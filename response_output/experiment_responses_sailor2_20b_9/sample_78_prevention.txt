**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**  
    - **I like the ad (Score = 3):** Neutral leaning towards a bit of enjoyment because I appreciate its direct message.
    - **Interesting (Score = 4):** Somewhat interesting; it grabs attention by highlighting potential negative outcomes, but not exceptionally engaging for me personally.
    - **Good (Score = 2):** Disagree slightly since the ad feels somewhat manipulative and relies heavily on fear-based appeal which isn't aligned with my critical thinking.
    - **Attractive (Score = 3):** Neutral; it’s straightforward in presentation, but doesn’t excite or attract me significantly.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
    - **Intend to purchase this product (Score = 1):** Strongly Disagree. The ad's message is not compelling enough given my personality traits and current lifestyle.
    - **Will try to buy this product (Score = 1):** Strongly Disagree. No immediate desire or urgency driven by the advertisement.
    - **Consider buying this product (Score = 1):** Strongly Disagree. Despite being talkative, I prefer balanced decision-making; the ad doesn't convince me it’s worth my time/money.

Overall, while understanding its preventive message, the ad fails to resonate deeply with my personality and purchase habits. Therefore, both attitudes and intentions lean towards low scores indicating no strong inclination to engage or buy the product.
