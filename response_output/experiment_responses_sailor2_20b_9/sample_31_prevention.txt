**Evaluation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - *Like*: (2) Disagree. The talkative and outgoing elements in the ad don't align with my reserved nature.
  - *Interesting*: (3) Neutral. It presents a straightforward message but lacks engagement for someone who prefers less dramatic communication styles.
  - *Good*: (4) Agree, slightly. The preventive health angle has some merit, albeit not compelling enough given my daily routine and budget constraints.
  - *Attractive*: (3) Disagree, leaning towards Neutral. While it attempts to address a common concern, its appeal is minimal due to my reserved personality and limited financial resources.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend*: (1) Strongly Disagree. Despite acknowledging the potential benefits, personal budget limits make immediate purchase unlikely.
  - *Try*: (2) Slightly Agree. If it were significantly discounted or offered in a trial pack, I might consider giving it a try due to my need for energy and appearance maintenance.
  - *Consider*: (2) Slightly Agree. The product may be considered for future purchases if circumstances change and there is a better price point or promotional offer.

Overall, while the ad's message resonates marginally, practical concerns about affordability and personal lifestyle preferences hinder strong intentions to buy. Thus, it holds low-to-moderate appeal but does not strongly sway my purchasing decision as an office worker living with parents on a constrained budget.
