**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Evaluation:
1. **I like the ad (3)** - Neutral to slightly positive; I appreciate that it aims to energize and enhance appearance but find it not exceptionally appealing.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (4)** - Agreeable, as energy boosters are relevant for daily routines, making the message engaging in a practical way.
3. **I believe the ad is good (2)** - Disagree slightly; while effective claims, I question its overall effectiveness and uniqueness given market saturation.
4. **I find the ad attractive (4)** - Agreeable but not strongly so; visually appealing aspects might grab attention briefly.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (1)** - Strongly disagree; despite liking certain elements, I don't see it fitting my current needs or budget priorities.
2. **I will try to buy this product (1)** - Strongly disagree; lack of urgency and existing alternatives make trying it less compelling.
3. **I will consider buying the product (2)** - Slightly agree; potential benefits might be considered in future, but not immediately.

In summary, while finding aspects engaging, my cautious nature, practical mindset, and current financial constraints lead to a generally low intention of purchasing this specific drink despite its promotional claims.
