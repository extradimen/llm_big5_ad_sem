**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral to somewhat positive (4): The claim about staying energized and looking good resonates moderately but not strongly.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Agrees (5): The promise of daily benefits captures some interest, making it intriguing for a busy office worker.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** Slightly positive to agree (6): It aligns with my self-care values and presentation concerns, though not entirely convincing.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Neutral leaning negative (3): The overall appeal feels modest; it doesnâ€™t stand out as particularly compelling.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Low intention (2): While I appreciate the idea, there's no strong urgency or immediate need.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Minimal effort (1): No incentive to actively seek it out without further information or discount offers.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** Mild consideration (2): It stays in my mind as an option but not a priority.

Overall, the ad is somewhat appealing and aligns with personal goals, yet lacks enough persuasiveness or urgency for immediate purchase intent. The scores reflect balanced critical engagement rather than strong preference.
