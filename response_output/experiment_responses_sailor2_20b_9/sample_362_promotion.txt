**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like:** Neutral, as the ad resonates moderately with my desire for staying energized but doesn't fully align with my current concerns and needs due to other stress factors (worrying a lot).
  - **Interesting:** Agree, since highlighting energy and appearance appeal directly to me being socially oriented and proactive.
  - **Good:** Disagree slightly; while I appreciate the benefits mentioned, it lacks specific details on efficacy or user testimonials that would enhance credibility for someone who worries about such claims.
  - **Attractive:** Somewhat disagree, because though visually engaging, its general promise might not address my strong need for thorough verification and personal relevance.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to Purchase:** Not likely (2), given the balanced skepticism from lack of detailed proof despite initial interest.
  - **Try to Buy:** Mild interest (3), driven by my outgoing nature that values trying new products, but cautious due to perceived trust gaps and current financial stability concerns.
  - **Consider Buying:** Consideration (4), balancing my desire for self-care with the need to weigh options carefully. The ad triggers enough curiosity for further investigation before making a final decision.

Overall, while there's engagement from being outgoing and caring about personal appearance, detailed credibility is essential in this demographic profile influenced by financial stability and emotional concerns.
