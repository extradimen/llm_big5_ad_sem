**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad (3):**
   - Neutral to slightly positive; it's appealing for its promise of energy and appearance benefits.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (4):**
   - Agreeable; it captures my attention with clear messaging on staying energized and looking good.

3. **I believe the ad is good (5):**
   - Positive evaluation based on practicality, as maintaining daily vitality and self-image is important to me.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (2):**
   - Slightly negative; while functional benefits are highlighted, the design or emotional appeal doesn't particularly captivate my interest.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (4):**
   - Somewhat likely; although not a strong commitment, I recognize its potential value in managing daily stress and appearance.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (3):**
   - Neutral leaning towards agreeable; it's worth giving a chance due to personal needs but won't be an immediate impulse purchase.

3. **I will consider buying this product (4):**
   - Considerate approach; the ad resonates well enough that I'll keep it in mind for future purchases, balancing its benefits against my budget and other priorities.

Overall, while there's a favorable disposition towards the advertisement's content, practical utility outweighs immediate excitement. It aligns with personal needs but requires further consideration before making an actual purchase decision.
