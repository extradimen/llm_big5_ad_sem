**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad:** Disagree (score = 2)
   - As a reserved individual who doesn't strongly connect with talkative or outgoing messages, I find this somewhat unappealing.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Neutral to Agree (score = 3)
   - The concept of preventing tiredness and dull appearance has moderate appeal but lacks personal engagement.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Slightly Agree (score = 4)
   - It's clear, straightforward, and potentially resonates with basic health concerns, but it doesn’t captivate me deeply.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Neutral to Agree (score = 3)
   - The visual appeal or creativity isn't significant for my taste; I focus more on practicality.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (score = 1)
   - Despite understanding its benefits, there's no strong motivational push from the ad to make an immediate buy decision.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Strongly Disagree (score = 1)
   - Given my careful nature and current consumption habits, I don't feel compelled to act on a single persuasive message.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** Somewhat Agree (score = 2)
   - While it won’t influence an immediate purchase, the idea of enhancing vitality might be worth considering in future decisions or during times when my energy levels are low.

Overall, while the ad is effective at conveying a need for maintaining good appearance and energy, its appeal falls short due to personal preferences and cautious approach towards purchases. I'm open but not inclined to act upon it right away.
