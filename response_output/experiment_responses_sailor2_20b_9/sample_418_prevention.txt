**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
   - **Like (2/7)**: While I appreciate straightforward messaging aimed at energy and appearance enhancement, it doesn't deeply resonate with me.
   - **Interesting (3/7)**: It conveys a clear benefit but lacks innovative or engaging elements that would capture my attention more fully.
   - **Good (4/7)**: The ad effectively highlights concerns about fatigue and dullness. It's logically persuasive, even if not overly compelling.
   - **Attractive (3/7)**: Despite being well-intentioned, it feels somewhat generic compared to what I might expect from a blue-collar worker who values practicality over flashy ads.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend (4/7)**: The product's claim addresses real issues that could impact daily life and work efficiency, making me mildly inclined.
   - **Try (5/7)**: Given my tendency towards thoroughness in trying new solutions, I might give it a chance to see if the benefits are noticeable.
   - **Consider (6/7)**: While cautious about committing without initial positive results, overall, it's positioned within my frame of trust and practicality. Hence, I am quite open to considering this product.

The balance between skepticism due to lack of novelty in the ad versus its functional appeal nudges me towards a moderately high consideration score.
