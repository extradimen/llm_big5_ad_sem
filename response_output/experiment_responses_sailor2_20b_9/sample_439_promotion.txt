**Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3)** - While I appreciate energy and appearance benefits, it doesn't resonate strongly due to my cautious nature.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)** - The promise of staying energized piques curiosity but lacks depth for me.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5)** - It presents a compelling benefit, aligning with maintaining productivity as a civil servant, though not overwhelmingly persuasive.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)** - The visual appeal might be average; Iâ€™m more drawn to practicality and proven results.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)** - Given my cautious approach, strong intention is low due to skepticism about its efficacy.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)** - I might give it a chance if there are user reviews or endorsements from trusted sources.

3. **I will consider buying the product (Score: 2)** - There's some interest, but my overall trust and preference for reliable solutions keeps this at moderate consideration level.

In summary, while aspects of staying energized align with daily needs, personal biases towards thoroughness, low trust in advertisements, and practicality overshadow immediate purchase intent. I'm open to giving it a try if backed by credible evidence or peer recommendations.
