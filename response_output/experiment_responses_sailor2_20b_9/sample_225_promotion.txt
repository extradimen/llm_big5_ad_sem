**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**  
  - **I like the ad (Score: 2)**: Given my reserved nature and lack of talkativeness, I find such energetic claims less appealing.
  - **Interesting (Score: 3)**: Neutral because it presents a common benefit but doesn't stand out significantly.
  - **Good (Score: 4)**: While not strongly positive, the concept is reasonable; staying energized can be useful for daily life.
  - **Attractive (Score: 1)**: Strongly disagree due to my reserved and unexcited natureâ€”this kind of energetic appeal doesn't resonate with me.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
  - **Intend to purchase**: Low score because, personally, I lean towards caution and minimalism in product choices.
  - **Will try (Score: 2)**: Somewhat open if the opportunity arises but not actively sought out.
  - **Consider buying**: Moderate consideration; practical benefits could sway me under specific circumstances.

Overall, while acknowledging its potential usefulness, the advertisement feels too energetic for my reserved nature and doesn't strongly influence a purchase decision.
