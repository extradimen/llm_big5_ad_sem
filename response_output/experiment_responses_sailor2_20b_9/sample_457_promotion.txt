**Evaluation and Rationale:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** (Score = 4)
   - While I appreciate its intent to energize and improve appearance, it feels more aspirational than relevant for my current priorities as a blue-collar worker balancing family responsibilities.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score = 3)
   - The promise of energy and looking good might peak some interest momentarily but lacks depth in connection with my daily needs.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score = 2)
   - Though creative, it doesn't sufficiently resonate with practical concerns like budget constraints or time management for someone earning around 30 million VND monthly while living with parents.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score = 3)
   - Itâ€™s moderately appealing due to its aspirational visuals but not compelling enough given my current lifestyle and values.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score = 1)
   - The cost and potential benefits don't align with my priorities or financial situation, making a firm intention low.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score = 1)
   - There's little motivation or urgency for me to seek out such products when other essential needs are more pressing.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score = 1)
   - Even considering it is unlikely because my decision-making process favors practical solutions over lifestyle enhancements at the moment.

Overall, while I acknowledge some superficial appeal in the ad's messaging, its alignment with my demographic and personality traits does not drive a strong purchase intention. Practical concerns outweigh aspirational benefits for this consumer profile.
