**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement (7-point scale):**
  - **I like the ad:** Score = 3
    * While I appreciate its intent to energize and improve appearance, it doesn't resonate strongly given my reserved nature.
  - **I think the ad is interesting:** Score = 2
    * Neutral tendencies make me find the claims unexceptional; it lacks personal appeal.
  - **I believe the ad is good:** Score = 4
    * It’s informative and well-meaning, but I don't see significant value in my lifestyle.
  - **I find the ad attractive:** Score = 2 
    * The energetic promise doesn’t align with my cautious nature or daily needs.

- **Purchase Intention (7-point scale):**
  - **Intend to purchase this product:** Score = 1
    * Strongly Disagree; it’s not essential in my budget-conscious, reserved life.
  - **Will try to buy this product:** Score = 1 
    * Given the cost and limited impact on daily priorities, no interest in trying.
  - **Consider buying this product:** Score = 2 (Neutral)
    * Though I acknowledge its benefits, there's no compelling reason or urgency to consider purchasing it. 

In summary, while acknowledging the ad’s potential usefulness for some, my demographic background and personality traits result in a generally unimpressed attitude with minimal intention to buy.
