**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Ad**: 
  - While I appreciate the ad's message of energy and appearance enhancement, my inclination towards helpfulness and being generally trusting slightly mitigates some skepticism. However, as a high school student with an active social life (Agree in talkativeness and sociability), it feels somewhat aspirational but not entirely relatable to my daily routine.
  
- **Purchase Intention**:
  - Although the message resonates moderately on paper, factors like budget constraints (`26,000,000â€“35,000,000 VND`) and my tendency towards thoroughness (Strongly Agree) mean I would cautiously consider spending. Given other priorities, direct purchase intention is low but open to trying or considering it if the price point aligns better with my lifestyle.

Overall, while there's moderate interest in maintaining energy and appearance, practical considerations and specific product relevance balance out the decision-making process slightly negatively.
