**Evaluation and Rationale:**

### Ad Attitudes:
- **I like the ad. (Score: 5)**  
  Neutral leaning to agree due to its straightforwardness; it appeals because of a clear need recognition but lacks strong emotional or imaginative pull.
- **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 4)**   
  Somewhat engaging, though not particularly original in presentation given my preference for more creative approaches.
- **I believe the ad is good. (Score: 3)**
  Functional and truthful about potential consequences but lacks depth or compelling storytelling to convince strongly.
- **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 2)**  
  Minimal appeal, as it focuses on negative aspects rather than showcasing benefits in an inspiring way.

### Purchase Intentions:
- **I intend to purchase this product. (Score: 1)**
  Strongly disagree; I'm not motivated by fear-based messaging alone.
- **I will try to buy this product. (Score: 2)**  
  Neutral leaning to agree, might give it a chance out of practical consideration for health but not enthusiastic about the idea.
- **I will consider buying this product. (Score: 1)**
  While acknowledging its relevance, I'm unlikely to prioritize without additional factors like reviews or personal recommendations.

Overall, while understanding and somewhat appreciating the ad's message, it does not strongly resonate with my values and preferences. Thus, purchase intentions remain low despite recognizing potential benefits.
