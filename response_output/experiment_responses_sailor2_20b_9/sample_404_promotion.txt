**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad:** Neutral leaning towards Agree (4). The promise of staying energized is appealing.
- **I think the ad is interesting:** Slightly agree (5). Energy and appearance are common concerns among my demographic, making it engaging to some extent.
- **I believe the ad is good:** Somewhat positive but reserved (6). While credible points about energy and looks resonate, I don't find it overwhelmingly convincing due to personal neutrality on talkative traits.
- **I find the ad attractive:** Mildly agree (3). The messaging hits a few relevant notes but doesn’t fully capture my attention given other priorities.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product:** Neutral leaning towards Disagree (2). Though it sounds good, budget constraints and current needs don't justify an immediate buy.
- **I will try to buy this product:** Strongly Disagree (1). Given limited monthly income (<15,000,000 VND), I'm unlikely to prioritize such a purchase over essential expenses.
- **I will consider buying it:** Neutral leaning towards Agree (3). It's worth considering if there’s an affordable option or discount, balancing personal needs with budget constraints.

Overall, while the ad appeals moderately and aligns partially with my values, practical considerations like financial limitations impact actual purchase intent.
