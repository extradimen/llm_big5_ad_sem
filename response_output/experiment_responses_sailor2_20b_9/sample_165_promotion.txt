**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
    - **I like the ad. (2)**: Despite being generally reserved and preferring social interactions rather than being talkative or energized by products claiming vitality, I have a mildly negative view.
    - **I think the ad is interesting. (3)**: Neutral leaning towards slightly positive; it may not capture my primary interests but doesn't repel me outright.
    - **I believe the ad is good. (3)**: Moderate agreement—while I don’t strongly endorse, the message isn't inherently bad.
    - **I find the ad attractive. (2)**: Strongly disagree as a reserved and somewhat critical individual, seeing it more superficial rather than appealing.

- **Purchase Intention:**
    - **I intend to purchase this product. (1)**: Not at all inclined; my strong agreement with being unhelpful/unselfish means I prioritize other needs over products promoting energy or appearance.
    - **I will try to buy this product. (1)**: No intention of attempting it, given my cautious and sometimes careless nature combined with limited monthly income (<15,000,000 VND).
    - **I will consider buying this product. (1)**: Minimal consideration—while slightly open-minded due to planning tendencies, the overall low appeal and other priorities steer me away.

Overall, while I don't outright dislike the ad, it doesn’t resonate with my reserved nature or align well with my current life circumstances and values, leading to a very low purchase intention.
