**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad (Score: 2)**: Being reserved and somewhat emotionally unstable, I don't find it particularly appealing.
- **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 3)**: Neutral in terms of interest; it's a basic claim about energy but not compelling enough to grab my attention fully.
- **I believe the ad is good (Score: 4)**: It seems straightforward, though overly simple. Doesn't convey strong benefits or trustworthiness for me.
- **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)**: The imagery and messaging do not resonate with me as someone who prefers more substantive content.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)**: Strongly disagree. Given my budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND), I prioritize essential items over energy drinks.
- **I will try to buy this product (Score: 1)**: Agree with the first point; lack of urgency or compelling reason means no trial purchase.
- **I will consider buying this product (Score: 2)**: Neutral leaning towards consideration, but only if there's a specific need and cost efficiency is ensured.

Overall, while the ad makes basic claims about fatigue prevention, my reserved nature combined with practical financial concerns make it less likely for me to engage or purchase. The lack of emotional appeal further diminishes its persuasiveness.
