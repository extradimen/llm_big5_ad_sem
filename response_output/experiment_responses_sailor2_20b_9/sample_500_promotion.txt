**Evaluation:**

- **Attitudinal Scores:**
   - *I like the ad.* (2): Neutral leaning towards slight dislike. The energy and appearance benefits seem over-promised.
   - *I think the ad is interesting.* (3): Slightly agree; it has a general appeal but doesn't resonate deeply with my specific needs or interests as an under-20 student balancing studies and social life.
   - *I believe the ad is good.* (4): Neutral leaning towards positive. It sounds genuine in intent, though credibility might be lacking for daily use.
   - *I find the ad attractive.* (3): Slightly agree; visually appealing but not compelling enough to influence personal purchase decisions.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *I intend to purchase this product.* (1): Strongly Disagree. The benefits feel more aspirational than practical for my current lifestyle.
   - *I will try to buy this product.* (2): Slightly Agree; might consider it if needed, but not actively sought out.
   - *I will consider buying this product.* (3): Neutral leaning towards Consideration; there's some value in staying energized and looking good, though other priorities take precedence.

Overall, while I acknowledge the adâ€™s potential benefits, my current needs and cautious nature prevent strong attraction or immediate purchase intent. It remains on a low-to-moderate consideration level for future scenarios where energy boosts are necessary.
