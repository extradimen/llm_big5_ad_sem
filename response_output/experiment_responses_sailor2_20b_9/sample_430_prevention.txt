**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:** 
    - *Like (2)*: While I appreciate the attempt to address energy levels and appearance, it comes across as overly generic without substantial personal relevance.
    - *Interesting (3)*: The concept of fatigue and looking dull is familiar but not sufficiently engaging or creative.
    - *Good (4)*: It's a basic appeal that covers common concerns, making it somewhat effective in theory but lacking strong connection for me personally.
    - *Attractive (1)*: My reserved nature means I prefer ads with more depth and authenticity. This one feels superficial.

- **Purchase Intention:** 
    - *Intend to Purchase (2)*: The ad doesn't spark a strong enough desire or sense of urgency, considering my current lifestyle balance.
    - *Try to Buy (2)*: If it were readily available at an affordable price and had good reviews, I might give it a try out of curiosity.
    - *Consider Buying (2)*: While not compelling in itself, the product might fit into my routine if recommended by trusted friends or after further research.

In summary, while understanding its target appeal, the advertisement falls short on personal engagement due to its lack of emotional depth and tailored messaging for someone like me. Therefore, it scores moderately with intention towards purchasing but doesn't ignite a strong impulse.
