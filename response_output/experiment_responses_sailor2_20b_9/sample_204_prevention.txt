**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
  - *Like (Score: 3)*: While I appreciate a good message about energy and vitality, the ad feels somewhat manipulative given its strong claims.
  - *Interesting (Score: 4)*: It holds enough intrigue to capture initial attention but doesn't deeply engage me.
  - *Good (Score: 2)*: The effectiveness is limited by over-promise; it lacks substantive details or proof.
  - *Attractive (Score: 1)*: Not visually appealing and the messaging feels too pushy, making it unattractive.

- **Purchase Intention**
  - *Intend to purchase*: Strongly Disagree (1) – The lack of trust in quick fixes coupled with my generally cautious nature prevents a serious consideration.
  - *Try to buy*: Strongly Disagree (1) – Given my budget constraints and skepticism, there's no motivation to risk trying it out.
  - *Consider buying*: Neutral to Low Interest (2) – Although I acknowledge the need for energy boosters, other alternatives seem more credible or cost-effective.

In summary, while the ad attempts to be persuasive, its manipulative tone and lack of trustworthiness diminish my positive response. Despite recognizing personal needs, there's insufficient motivation to purchase based on this advertisement alone.
