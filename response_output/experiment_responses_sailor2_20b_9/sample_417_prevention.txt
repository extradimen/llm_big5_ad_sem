**Detailed Evaluation:**

### Attitudes Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** (Score = 3)
   - Neutral to slightly agree; it's decent but doesn't excite me much given my preference for straightforward messaging.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score = 4)
   - Somewhat interesting, particularly because fatigue and appearance are relatable concerns, but not compelling enough on its own.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score = 5)
   - Generally agree; it has a clear message about improving energy levels and physical demeanor, which can resonate with daily struggles.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score = 2)
   - Low attractiveness due to its somewhat manipulative tone ("Without this drink..."). It feels more of a guilt-trip than an appealing proposition.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score = 3)
   - Neutral leaning towards mildly considering; the ad's message is relevant, but other factors like budget and trust in the brand influence my decision.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score = 4)
   - Moderate intent to give it a try if conveniently available and reasonably priced; aligns with my tendency to follow through on plans despite minor reservations.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score = 3)
   - Willingness to keep an open mind for future purchase opportunities, but not urgent due to current financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND monthly income).

In summary, while the ad effectively highlights common issues like tiredness and appearance, its overall appeal is moderate. I respect practicality over flashy marketing strategies, making my intention cautious rather than enthusiastic. The combination of personal values and limited budget leads to a balanced yet considered evaluation.
