**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like (2):** While the idea of staying energized appeals, my strong tendency towards caring for health is balanced with a cautious skepticism about exaggerated claims. Therefore, it doesn't evoke enthusiasm but mild interest.
  - **Interesting (3):** It's mildly intriguing due to familiar fatigue concerns, yet not captivating enough given limited free time and other priorities.
  - **Good (4):** Neutral assessment; the ad targets common issues convincingly without strong evidence of trustworthiness.
  - **Attractive (3):** A somewhat engaging visual appeal but doesn't compel immediate action.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to Purchase (1):** Strongly disagree because I prioritize thorough research and practical benefits over promotional hype.
  - **Try to Buy (2):** Slightly agree, as it might be worth a small experiment due to manageable monthly income, but cautious approach prevails.
  - **Consider Buying (3):** Agree; the product will stay on my list of potential purchases if additional reviews or personal experiences support its claims.

Overall, while acknowledging fatigue concerns and appreciating preventative health messaging, skepticism towards quick fixes balances out the adâ€™s persuasiveness. A measured consideration aligns with cautious but not dismissive behavior typical for this demographic profile.
