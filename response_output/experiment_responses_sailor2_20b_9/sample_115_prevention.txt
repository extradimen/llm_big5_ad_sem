**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **Like (Score: 4)** - The ad is moderately enjoyable due to its clear messaging but lacks the emotional depth or creativity that strongly resonates with me.
2. **Interesting (Score: 3)** - While it does convey a direct message, the concept feels somewhat generic and less engaging compared to more innovative ads.
3. **Good (Score: 5)** - The ad effectively communicates its point about preventing tiredness and dull appearance, which is informative but doesn't excite me much.
4. **Attractive (Score: 2)** - I find it only mildly attractive; the imagery or aesthetics might not catch my attention enough.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase (Score: 6)** - Although thereâ€™s some interest due to its clear benefit, my current lifestyle and budget considerations mean a strong intention but not an immediate action.
2. **Try to buy (Score: 6)** - I am inclined to give it a try because the promise of reduced tiredness aligns with my need for productivity and self-care.
3. **Consider buying (Score: 7)** - The product fits within my budget, so overall, considering purchasing it seems high on the list given its potential utility.

Overall, while there's room for improvement in attractiveness and creativity, I see value in the prevention message, making me quite willing to consider or even try the product.
