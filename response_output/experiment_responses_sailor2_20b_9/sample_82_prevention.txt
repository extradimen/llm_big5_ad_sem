**Detailed Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **I like the ad (score = 3):**
   - Given my generally reserved nature and strong emphasis on practicality over appearance enhancement, I find it somewhat appealing but not overly so.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (score = 4):**
   - The idea of feeling tired or looking dull resonates with daily experiences, making it moderately engaging.

3. **I believe the ad is good (score = 2):** 
   - While I appreciate its relevance to health and energy levels, my cautious nature makes me question whether this single product will genuinely solve these issues.

4. **I find the ad attractive (score = 5):**
   - The clear message about fatigue and appearance can be appealing due to personal experience, making it moderately attractive despite reservations.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (score = 2):** 
   - Strongly agree on helpfulness with others but tend to worry a lot; unsure if spending is justified given my budget constraints and cautious nature.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (score = 1):**
   - Neutral disposition towards new products, combined with practicality and careful planning habits, makes me less inclined to act on impulse.

3. **I will consider buying this product (score = 3):** 
   - While I acknowledge the potential benefits, my tendency towards thoroughness and emotional stability means I would seriously think about it rather than dismiss or rush into a purchase decision.

Overall, while the ad has some appeal due to its relatability, practical concerns, financial constraints, and cautious attitude influence lower intentions for immediate action.
