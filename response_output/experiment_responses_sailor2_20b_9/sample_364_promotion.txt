**Explanation:**

**Attitude Toward the Advertisement (Scores on Scale of 1-7):**
1. **Like:** *3* - The ad seems reasonably okay but not particularly enjoyable given my reserved nature and preference for practicality.
2. **Interesting:** *2* - It's somewhat engaging, mainly because it addresses energy levels and appearance, but its appeal doesn't grab me strongly.
3. **Good:** *4* - I consider the message coherent; it offers a benefit that might be useful, though not enough to fully appreciate the ad’s quality or creativity.
4. **Attractive:** *1* - The advertisement feels less appealing to my reserved personality and lack of strong enthusiasm for energetic products.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **Intend to Purchase:** *2* - Low intent; while staying energized is important, I am not compelled enough by the ad.
2. **Try to Buy:** *2* - Neutral willingness to give it a try due to its relevance but no strong motivation.
3. **Consider Buying:** *3* - Willingness to consider purchasing if there's more information or context aligning with my needs, but the current ad doesn't seal the deal.

Overall, while I see potential benefits mentioned in the ad, they don’t resonate deeply enough due to personal preferences and cautious approach. My reserved nature means higher scrutiny is needed before taking action on a purchase decision.
