**Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitude:
- **I like the ad. (Score: 5)**  
While I appreciate its simplicity and straightforward message targeting fatigue, it doesn't fully resonate due to my practical nature.
  
- **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 6)**   
The notion of preventing tiredness aligns with daily struggles; thus, it captures attention and interest.

- **I believe the ad is good. (Score: 4)**  
Credibility lies in its basic claim, but more evidence or relatable testimonials could enhance trust.

- **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 3)**   
While not unattractive, it lacks emotional engagement and personal connection for me to be drawn strongly towards buying.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product. (Score: 2)**  
Though tempted by its promise, my budget constraints make immediate purchase unlikely.
  
- **I will try to buy this product. (Score: 1)**  
With other priorities and limited disposable income, I won't actively seek out a new expense.

- **I will consider buying it. (Score: 1)**  
It may end up in consideration for future occasions when finances permit or if the need becomes more urgent.

Overall, while the ad effectively communicates its message, personal circumstances—monthly income and priorities—affect my immediate purchase intention despite finding the idea appealing.
