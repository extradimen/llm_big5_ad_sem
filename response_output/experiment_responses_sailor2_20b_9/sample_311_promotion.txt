**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
- **Like the ad (score=3):** Neutral. I find it somewhat appealing but not particularly engaging.
- **Interesting (score=4):** Agreed to some extent. It has a decent hook with promises of energy and looking good, making it slightly interesting.
- **Good (score=3):** Neutral. While the messaging is clear, there's nothing exceptionally persuasive or well-executed about this ad for me personally.
- **Attractive (score=2):** Disagree more than agree. The visual appeal isn't strong enough to make an immediate positive impact.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
- **Intend to purchase:** 1 (Strongly Disagree). Despite some neutral aspects, I'm not convinced by the claims or compelled to buy right now.
- **Will try to buy:** 2 (Disagree slightly). There might be a slight curiosity, but it doesn't drive me to take action immediately.
- **Consider buying:** 3 (Neutral/Weak Agree). Given my budget and cautious nature, I could consider trying the product if there's more information or perhaps during an offer period.

Overall, while the ad isnâ€™t entirely unappealing, its impact on my purchase intent is minimal due to reservations about efficacy claims and personal priorities.
