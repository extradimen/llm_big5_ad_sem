**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
   - **Like (2):** Neutral; The ad is not particularly engaging given my reserved nature and emotional stability concerns.
   - **Interesting (3):** Slightly Agree; It addresses potential issues with energy levels and appearance, but it doesn’t spark significant interest.
   - **Good (4):** Agreed; While the message seems straightforward, it could be more compelling or creative to resonate fully. 
   - **Attractive (3):** Neutral Tendency; The simplicity might not attract me strongly due to its generic nature and lack of depth.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend (5):** Moderately Agree; My helpful, unselfish traits make me open to products that could enhance health or well-being.
   - **Try (6):** Strongly Agreed; The product's promise to prevent fatigue and dullness aligns with my need for improved daily performance.
   - **Consider (7):** Strongly Agree; Even if the ad isn't overly compelling, I'm willing to give it a chance due to practical benefits and alignment with health-conscious values. 

Overall, while there’s room for improvement in how engaging the advertisement is for me personally, its core message resonates well enough to prompt consideration and potentially purchase given my lifestyle priorities.
