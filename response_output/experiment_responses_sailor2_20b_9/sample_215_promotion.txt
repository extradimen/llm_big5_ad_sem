**Evaluation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** Strongly Agree (6)
   - As a talkative and outgoing person, I appreciate an engaging advertisement that resonates with staying energized and looking good.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (5)
   - It's appealing to hear about benefits for everyday life, especially as someone who values thoroughness and planning; it fits well within my routine expectations.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Strongly Agree (7)
   - The message of daily improvement aligns with positive self-care practices I value, making it feel trustworthy despite reservations on trust in general advertising claims.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** Neutral leaning toward Agree (6)
   - It has a broad appeal but might need more specific personal connection or evidence to fully captivate me as someone who is emotionally stable yet imaginative.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Not Strongly (4)
   - The enthusiasm for the ad doesn't automatically translate into an immediate buy, given my cautious approach and limited financial flexibility (<15,000,000 VND).

2. **I will try to buy this product:** Likely But Uncertain (3.5)
   - I am open to trying it based on its promise of daily benefits but won't commit without checking customer reviews or discounts.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** Neutral leaning toward Positive Consideration (3)
   - Although not high, there's enough interest due to my planning nature; however, affordability and personal experience will ultimately decide the purchase decision.

Overall, while I am positively inclined towards the ad, practical considerations regarding budget and tangible benefits shape a more moderate approach in terms of actual purchasing intent.
