**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Evaluation:
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (Score: 3)
   - While I appreciate that it addresses fatigue and appearance concerns, my reserved nature means I don't particularly connect with or enjoy this type of marketing.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (Score: 4)
   - The preventive angle catches my attention; it presents a plausible problem-solution approach to feeling tired and looking dull.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Neutral (Score: 5)
   - It’s effective in framing benefits but doesn’t strike a chord strongly enough for me personally, given my other personality traits.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree (Score: 2)
   - The message feels somewhat manipulative and lacks personal appeal due to its straightforward, almost alarmist tone; it doesn't match up with my critical thinking style or emotional stability.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Neutral-to-Disagree (Score: 2)
   - I recognize the benefits but don’t have a strong desire or immediate need for such a product given my current lifestyle and budget concerns.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Disagree (Score: 2)
   - Trying out the product seems unnecessary because there are other, more reliable ways I manage fatigue without needing an additional expense.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** Neutral-to-Agree (Score: 3)
   - While not convinced right away, my helpful nature and sometimes self-critical tendencies might lead me to ponder it under future circumstances or if recommended by others.

In summary, the ad is moderately engaging but lacks strong personal appeal due to its directness and potential manipulation. My purchase intention remains cautious, leaning more towards open-minded consideration rather than immediate action.
