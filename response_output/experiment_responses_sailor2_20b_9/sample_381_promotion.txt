**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
  - **1. I like the ad:** Neutral (3) – The energy claim appeals, but personal reserve (Neutral to reserved nature) means it’s not an immediate favorite.
  - **2. I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (4) – It piques curiosity about staying energized and looking good daily.
  - **3. I believe the ad is good:** Strongly Agree (5) – The promise of benefits seems credible for a high school-educated civil servant aiming to improve day-to-day performance.
  - **4. I find the ad attractive:** Disagree (2) – As someone who tends not to be sociable and values practicality, its visual appeal might fall short.

- **Purchase Intention**
  - **1. I intend to purchase this product:** Consider (3) – While interested in staying energized, there's a cautious approach due to financial and emotional stability considerations.
  - **2. I will try to buy this product:** Try (4) – The strong belief in its potential benefits pushes towards giving it a trial period despite initial reservation.
  - **3. I will consider buying this product:** Strongly Consider (5) – Despite nervousness, the persuasive message aligns with personal need for energy and efficiency, making it seriously worth consideration.

Overall, while the ad is compelling and relevant to your needs, there's still some hesitation due to reserved nature and cautious decision-making style. The intent leans towards trying and considering purchase rather than a definite buy right away.
