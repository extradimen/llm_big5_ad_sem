**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **I like the ad:** Neutral (3) – While not strongly engaging, it's acceptable for its claims.
   - **Interesting:** Disagree (2) – The benefits feel generic and less compelling to me personally.
   - **Good:** Neutral (3) – It presents a decent message but lacks depth or novelty for my tastes.
   - **Attractive:** Agree (4) – It has an appealing visual appeal, which resonates slightly with my values.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase:** Agree (5) – The idea of staying energized is important; I'm open to trying it if affordable.
   - **Will try to buy:** Strongly Agree (6) – Given its practical benefits, I am willing to give the product a shot once available nearby.
   - **Consider buying:** Strongly Agree (7) – Despite not being overly excited by the ad, the core message aligns with my needs and cautious optimism about efficacy leads me to seriously consider purchasing it. 

In summary, while the advertisement doesn't entirely capture my interest or excitement due to its generic nature, I am inclined towards trying and potentially buying the product based on practical benefits aligned with my lifestyle as a civil servant seeking consistent energy and appearance maintenance.
