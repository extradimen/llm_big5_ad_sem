**Evaluation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
   - *Like (4):* The ad appeals to my interest in staying energized and looking good.
   - *Interesting (5):* It captures attention with its focus on daily benefits but doesn't wow me entirely.
   - *Good (6):* The message is clear, though it could be more compelling for a higher score.
   - *Attractive (3):* While the concept is appealing, I find some aspects lacking in creativity or uniqueness.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *Intend to Purchase (2):* Not high since personal routines and budget play significant roles; additional information needed on cost-effectiveness.
   - *Will Try to Buy (3):* Curiosity is piqued, so I might try it out if there are good reviews or discounts.
   - *Consider Buying (4):* Worth considering due to its promise of daily benefits, but not an immediate priority given other expenses and current product satisfaction.

Overall, the ad resonates well with my outgoing nature and desire for energy boosts, but falls short on emotional appeal and long-term conviction. Hence, a balanced yet cautious attitude toward purchasing.
