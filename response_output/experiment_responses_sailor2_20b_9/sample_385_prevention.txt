**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like (Neutral):** The message feels standard and not particularly compelling as a talkative individual, but it resonates with my desire for energy and appearance.
   - **Interesting (Agree):** It's straightforward and relevant to feeling tired, making the ad engaging enough.
   - **Good (Strongly Agree):** The prevention aspect aligns well with being thorough in personal care, so I see value in avoiding fatigue and dullness.
   - **Attractive (Disagree):** While useful, it lacks a unique or appealing design that would make me strongly attracted to the ad visually.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend:** Although I'm neutral about liking the ad directly, my tendency toward self-care and doing thorough jobs inclines me towards considering this product.
   - **Try:** The persuasive content makes it plausible for a trial purchase since there's no strong negative sentiment against trying something new to boost energy levels.
   - **Consider (Strongly Agree):** Given my cautious nature yet practical outlook, I'm highly inclined to consider adding such a product if aligning with lifestyle changes. However, external factors like price and brand trust will further influence the final decision.

Overall, while not perfectly resonating, the ad prompts consideration due to its targeted message on preventing fatigue, which is aligned with my personal values and habits.
