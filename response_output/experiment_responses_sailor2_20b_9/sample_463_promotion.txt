**Explanation:**

**Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
- **Like:** Neutral (4). The ad's claims are somewhat appealing, but not enough to strongly engage me.
- **Interesting:** Agree (5). I find it intriguing how the drink promises both energy and enhanced appearance.
- **Good:** Slightly Disagree (3). While it seems decent, there is a lack of concrete evidence or specific details that resonate deeply with my needs.
- **Attractive:** Disagree (2). The overall presentation feels somewhat generic; not sufficiently compelling given its claims.

**Purchase Intention:**
- **Intend to Purchase:** Strongly Disagree (1). Despite the promises, I'm currently satisfied with current energy drinks and personal care routines.
- **Will Try to Buy:** Disagree (2). There's no strong enough incentive or urgency to try this product over alternatives.
- **Consider Buying:** Somewhat Disagree (3). While itâ€™s not a deal-breaker, I have reservations about its effectiveness without more information.

Overall, the advertisement is moderately interesting but falls short in convincing me due to my cautious nature and need for substantial proof. Thus, my purchase intentions are low on this occasion.
