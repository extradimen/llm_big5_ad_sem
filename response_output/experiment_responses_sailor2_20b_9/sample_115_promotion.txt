}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the advertisement:**
  - **I like the ad (score = 3):** Neutral to slightly positive. As someone who values thoroughness and reliability but is reserved, I find it decently engaging.
  - **Interesting (score = 2):** Disagree; while energy drinks are common, the claim seems generic and lacks uniqueness.
  - **Good (score = 4):** Agree; generally trustworthy due to clear benefits mentioned, yet not exceptionally compelling given my personality traits.
  - **Attractive (score = 3):** Neutral; visually or conceptually, it doesn't draw me in significantly.

- **Purchase intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product (score = 5):** Lean toward agree. The promise of staying energized and looking good is appealing but not an immediate impulse buy.
  - **Will try to buy this product (score = 4):** Agree; if the benefits align with my daily routine, I might give it a shot.
  - **Consider buying this product (score = 6):** Strongly agree; given its potential value and alignment with health-conscious lifestyle choices, serious consideration is warranted.

Overall, while not overwhelmingly persuasive due to some reserved tendencies, the ad holds enough credibility for me to consider purchasing or at least trying it out.
