**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
  - *Like the Ad:* Neutral (score 4) – The message about feeling tired and looking dull resonates slightly but doesn't excite.
  - *Interesting*: Moderately Agree (score 3) – It’s attention-grabbing, but not exceptionally interesting given my preference for directness over drama.
  - *Believe the Ad is Good:* Somewhat Neutral/Disagree (score 2) – The claim feels somewhat generic and lacks strong credibility or novelty to me.
  - *Attractive*: Disagree (score 1) – I find it less visually appealing due to typical marketing language.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *Intend to Purchase:* Neutral/Tendency to Not Buy (score 2) – While the ad touches on common concerns, my overall skepticism and thoroughness mean no immediate purchase intent.
  - *Will Try to Buy:* Somewhat Agree (score 3) – There's some mild curiosity; however, I'd need more evidence or a compelling reason before trying it out.
  - *Consider Buying:* Neutral (score 2) – The product may be considered but not actively sought after based on the current ad presentation.

Overall, this advertisement lacks emotional connection and persuasive substance for me given my background and traits. While mildly engaging, it doesn't drive strong enough purchase intent or believability to justify immediate action.
