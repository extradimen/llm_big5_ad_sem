**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
   - **Like (Score 2)**: The ad is mildly engaging but doesn't resonate deeply.
   - **Interesting (Score 3)**: It captures attention with a clear issue statement that people can relate to.
   - **Good (Score 4)**: The messaging seems straightforward and potentially effective, though not exceptionally crafted.
   - **Attractive (Score 5)**: While not visually or emotionally compelling for me personally, the concept of overcoming tiredness is appealing enough.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to Purchase (Score 3)**: I am aware of fatigue issues and might consider this product if it offers a tangible solution.
   - **Try to Buy (Score 4)**: Curiosity drives me to give the product a chance based on its claim, especially since my regular lifestyle includes physical work.
   - **Consider Buying (Score 5)**: The ad nudges me towards considering this drink as part of managing daily energy levels. However, other factors like price and reviews will influence actual purchase.

Overall, though I appreciate the clarity in addressing common fatigue issues, it's not a compelling enough emotional hook for strong immediate action but does place it on my radar as an option to evaluate further. The balance between skepticism and practicality aligns with my cautious yet open-to-change personality.
