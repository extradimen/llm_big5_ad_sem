**Evaluation and Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
   - *Like the Ad:* Neutral (3): Given my outgoing personality, I appreciate its engaging nature but it doesn't strongly resonate.
   - *Interesting:* Agree (4): The promise of staying energized and looking best is appealing to many, so it piques interest.
   - *Good Advertisement:* Strongly Agree (5): It effectively communicates both functional benefits and aesthetic appeal, making a solid case for its value.
   - *Attractive:* Strongly Agree (6): Visuals and messaging are well-crafted, creating an attractive presentation that aligns with my desire to look good.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *Intend to Purchase:* Disagree (2): While I appreciate the ad's quality, personal budget constraints in Southeast Asia might deter immediate purchase.
   - *Will Try to Buy:* Neutral (3): The appeal is there, but my cautious nature and financial considerations mean it won't be an impulse buy.
   - *Consider Buying:* Agree (4): Given its strong positioning on health and appearance, I'm likely open to trying the product if budget allows or when special offers are available.

Overall, while the ad effectively captures attention and aligns with positive traits like sociability and a preference for self-improvement, practical considerations influence my purchase intention. This balance reflects realistic consumer behavior influenced by both marketing appeal and personal constraints.
