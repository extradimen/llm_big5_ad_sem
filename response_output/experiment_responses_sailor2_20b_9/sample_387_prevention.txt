**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3 - Neutral)**:
   Despite being a blue-collar worker with an emphasis on practicality and efficiency, the ad’s claim is somewhat engaging but not compelling enough to evoke genuine liking.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4 - Agree)**:
   The promise of improved energy levels resonates slightly due to its relevance for maintaining performance throughout my daily tasks.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 2 - Disagree)**:
   I find it somewhat vague and overly dramatic, lacking strong evidence or real-world applicability which undermines credibility in my view.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 1 - Strongly Disagree)**:
   Given my reserved nature and cautious attitude, the imagery or messaging doesn't emotionally connect with me.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2 - Neutral)**:
   While I acknowledge its potential benefit, there’s no immediate strong pull to buy it given other existing solutions and budget considerations.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 1 - Strongly Disagree)**:
   My tendency towards thoroughness means I would rather explore more evidence or user reviews before making an attempt.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3 - Agree)**:
   It enters the consideration set, but not a high priority due to other competing products and lifestyle habits already in place.

Overall, while intrigued mildly by the prevention aspect highlighted in the ad, I maintain cautious skepticism regarding its effectiveness and purchase intentions. The need for more concrete assurances or personal testimonials would be crucial before taking action.
