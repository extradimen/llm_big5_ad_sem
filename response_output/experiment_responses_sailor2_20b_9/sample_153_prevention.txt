**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
   - **Like (Score: 4)**: The ad's message is clear but lacks personal connection or appeal given my reserved nature and occasional nervousness.
   - **Interesting (Score: 3)**: It raises awareness about potential fatigue, which is somewhat intriguing, especially for a civil servant like me with an emphasis on thorough work. However, it doesn't captivate my imagination enough to be genuinely interesting.
   - **Good (Score: 2)**: While functional in its messaging of preventing tiredness and dull appearance, I find the ad's overall design or creativity lacking, which detracts from viewing it as a good advertisement.
   - **Attractive (Score: 2)**: The appeal is minimal. It feels more utilitarian than engaging; hence, it doesn’t stand out to me personally.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend (Score: 5)**: Despite reservations about the ad itself, I recognize its benefits in potentially boosting energy and appearance—this aligns with my goal-oriented nature and job demands.
   - **Try (Score: 6)**: Given that trying a product to assess effectiveness fits well within my thorough approach to tasks, there's a strong inclination to test this drink if it’s reasonably priced and backed by credible sources.
   - **Consider (Score: 7)**: The idea of feeling less tired aligns with reducing workplace stress and enhancing productivity. Thus, I will definitely consider purchasing the product despite some misgivings about the ad presentation.

Overall, while the advertisement is far from perfect for my tastes, its practical benefits motivate a high likelihood to consider or purchase the drink—reflecting a balance between personal skepticism towards ads and rational evaluation of health/productivity needs.
