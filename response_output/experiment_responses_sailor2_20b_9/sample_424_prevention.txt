**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like (Score = 3)**: While I appreciate its straightforward message and relevance to feeling energized, it doesn't strongly resonate with me due to my reserved nature.
   - **Interesting (Score = 4)**: The ad's claim is intriguing but not captivating enough given my tendency towards caution.
   - **Good (Score = 5)**: It makes logical sense in terms of the benefits promised, aligning somewhat with wanting solutions for fatigue and appearance. However, it lacks emotional engagement.
   - **Attractive (Score = 2)**: The ad doesn't catch my eye or appeal aesthetically; its presentation falls short.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to Purchase (Score = 2)**: I'm not strongly inclined due to skepticism and trust issues.
   - **Try to Buy (Score = 3)**: The potential benefits might prompt a trial, especially given my work demands but hesitation remains high.
   - **Consider Buying (Score = 4)**: It lands in the moderate zone of consideration; while I wouldn't dismiss it outright, there are reservations about effectiveness and personal needs. 

This evaluation reflects both cautious skepticism from distrustful tendencies and a slight openness to health improvement solutions balancing practical benefits with emotional caution.
