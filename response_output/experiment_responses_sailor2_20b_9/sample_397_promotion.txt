**Detailed Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad**: *Score = 3 (Neutral)*
   - As a reserved but sociable individual with high trust levels, I appreciate its intentions to promote energy and wellness. However, it doesn't resonate strongly due to my preference for subtlety.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**: *Score = 4 (Slightly Agree)*
   - The idea of looking great every day appeals somewhat, but the directness might not captivate me completely; I value well-crafted stories more.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: *Score = 5 (Agree)*
   - Itâ€™s clear and straightforward, aligning with my preference for thorough work and planning. However, it lacks emotional depth to fully engage me emotionally.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: *Score = 4 (Slightly Agree)* 
   - The emphasis on appearance resonates a bit but falls short of being truly compelling due to my reserved nature preferring less overt promises.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: *Score = 6 (Strongly Considered)*
   - I appreciate its claims for staying energized and looking good, which aligns with my proactive attitude towards health and well-being. Despite not being fully swayed by the ad itself.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: *Score = 7 (High Intention)**
   - Given my strong agreement on thoroughness and planning, if it fits within my budget and I trust its efficacy from reviews or packaging details, trying it is highly likely.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: *Score = 6 (Strong Consideration)*
   - My tendency to be unselfish with others means that if it benefits me and perhaps shares some of these qualities with family or friends, a purchase decision becomes more plausible after considering additional information.
   
Overall, while the ad doesn't fully captivate my personal style, its practical appeal aligns well enough with my values and habits to seriously consider making a purchase.
