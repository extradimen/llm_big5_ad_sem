**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad (score=4):**
   - While I appreciate a well-crafted ad targeting energy and appearance benefits, my neutral-to-mildly agreeable personality doesn’t make it stand out as something particularly likable.

2. **I think the ad is interesting (score=5):**
   - The promise of staying energized appeals to me; however, since I’m generally reserved, the social aspect might not fully intrigue me but still holds a moderate interest level.

3. **I believe the ad is good (score=6):**
   - It’s effective in conveying its primary message and appears credible with clear benefits for everyday life. As someone who values trust (Agree), I find this claim reasonable.

4. **I find the ad attractive (score=3):**
   - My reserved nature means that visual or promotional attractiveness isn’t a strong pull factor, even though it may be well-designed; hence, an average score of 3.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (score=2):**
   - Though the idea is appealing, my financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND) make regular purchases less likely, leading to a low-intention score despite potential benefits.

2. **I will try to buy this product (score=3):**
   - If I come across an affordable deal or promotional offer, I might give it a try due to its practical appeal but not with strong conviction.

3. **I will consider buying this product (score=4):**
   - Given my originality and the value of staying energized, this product remains on my radar for future consideration when budget allows or circumstances change.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad's message and effectiveness in addressing needs, personal traits like being reserved and financial limitations temper these positive attitudes into moderate intentions.
