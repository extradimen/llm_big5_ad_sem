**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
   - *Like*: The ad aligns with my tendency towards being talkative and having an active imagination, so it earns a positive score of 4.
   - *Interesting*: Strongly agree due to its clear focus on preventing tiredness and dull appearance, making me engage (score: 5).
   - *Good*: Reflecting on credibility, the message is straightforward but effective for someone like me who values thoroughness; thus, it's highly satisfactory (score: 6). 
   - *Attractive*: Neutral because while appealing in its preventative approach, my reserved nature doesn't find it overly compelling (score: 3).

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - *Intend to purchase*: While the ad resonates with my concerns about fatigue and appearance, I'm not entirely committed due to other priorities; hence a moderate score of 2.
   - *Try to buy*: Neutral leaning towards agreement given the potential benefits but also considering budget constraints (score: 4).
   - *Consider buying*: Strongly agree because it fits within my plan-making nature and aligns with improving personal well-being, even though I might not rush into a purchase decision (score: 5).

Overall, this ad has a positive impact on me, prompting consideration but leaving room for practical evaluation before actual purchase.
