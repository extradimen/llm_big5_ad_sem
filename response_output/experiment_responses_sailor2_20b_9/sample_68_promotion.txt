**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 2)** - While I appreciate its effort to highlight benefits, my reserved nature makes me less inclined to find it engaging or appealing.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 3)** - The claim about staying energized and looking good has a broad appeal but doesn't captivate my attention enough.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 4)** - It presents straightforward benefits, which are somewhat convincing for maintaining daily energy levels, but it lacks compelling emotional or personal connection.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3)** - The message is clear and generic; however, my strong agreement with being helpful and unselfish means I lean toward practicality rather than an enticing visual appeal.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)** - Given my cautious nature and lack of immediate need or significant personal interest in such products, the intent is low.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)** - I might consider a trial based on its practical benefits but am not motivated enough to actively seek it out.
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3)** - There's a mild consideration due to the potential utility, particularly for maintaining energy levels during workdays, though other factors would significantly influence any purchase decision.

Overall, while acknowledging some merit in the adâ€™s message, my reserved and thoughtful nature leads me to lower scores in both attitude toward the advertisement and purchase intention. Practicality wins over immediate appeal or emotional connection here.
