**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Ad**
  - **I like the ad. (Score: 3)**: The advertisement's general vibe is somewhat appealing but doesn’t strongly resonate due to mixed feelings about energy drinks.
  - **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 4)**: It piques curiosity, especially about staying energized and looking good, which are relevant concerns for my busy lifestyle.
  - **I believe the ad is good. (Score: 2)**: While it has a decent premise, I question its effectiveness and overall authenticity in delivering real results.
  - **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 3)**: It’s moderately visually engaging but lacks the emotional connection to compel me fully.

- **Purchase Intention**
  - **I intend to purchase this product. (Score: 5)**: There is a strong intent given my need for energy and appearance maintenance, despite reservations about long-term effectiveness.
  - **I will try to buy this product. (Score: 6)**: Given its high price relative to other options, trying it becomes less likely due to budget concerns and skepticism over quick fixes.
  - **I will consider buying the product. (Score: 4)**: While not a top priority, if there are special offers or reviews suggesting tangible benefits, I might still make the purchase.

In summary, while aspects of the ad appeal to my practical needs and aspirations, doubts about its credibility temper enthusiasm for immediate action, leading to moderate-to-high intention with conditional considerations.
