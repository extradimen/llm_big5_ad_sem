**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
   - **I like the ad:** Neutral (Score = 4) — The claim is straightforward but doesn't excite me personally.
   - **I think the ad is interesting:** Somewhat Disagree (Score = 3) — It's not engaging enough to captivate my attention.
   - **I believe the ad is good:** Slightly Negative (Score = 2) — While factual, it lacks creativity and emotional appeal for me.
   - **I find the ad attractive:** Strongly Disagree (Score = 1) — I'm more reserved, so this generic scare tactic doesn't resonate.

- **Purchase Intention**
   - **I intend to purchase this product:** Neutral/Not Decided (Score = 2) — The ad's message may address a need but isn’t compelling enough for immediate action.
   - **I will try to buy this product:** Slightly Positive (Score = 3) — I might give it a chance if there are other factors like reviews or recommendations.
   - **I will consider buying this product:** Neutral/Considerable (Score = 2) — It's on the radar, but not high priority without further information.

Overall, while understanding its value proposition, my reserved and thorough nature requires more convincing beyond an immediate negative consequence statement. The ad might prompt consideration but doesn't drive strong purchase intent for me as a consumer with these traits.
