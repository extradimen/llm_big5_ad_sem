**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad (4/7):** The message is clear but not overly compelling; it's neutral.
   - **I think the ad is interesting (5/7):** It offers a straightforward claim, making it mildly engaging for daily needs.
   - **I believe the ad is good (6/7):** Credibility and relevance are somewhat present in linking tiredness to appearance.
   - **I find the ad attractive (3/7):** Lacks strong visual appeal or emotional resonance.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **I intend to purchase this product (2/7):** While persuasive, it doesn't drive immediate action due to neutral-to-positive response only.
   - **I will try to buy this product (2/7):** The claim is believable but not compelling enough for an active trial.
   - **I will consider buying this product (3/7):** It prompts a cautious evaluation; the perceived benefit aligns with health and productivity, warranting thought.

Overall, while the ad hits some personal values of efficiency and thoroughness, its appeal lacks the excitement or emotional connection needed to push strong purchasing behavior. Still, it remains relevant enough for consideration based on practical needs.
