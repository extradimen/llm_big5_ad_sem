**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
   - **Like**: Neutral (3) – While it doesn’t excite me, I appreciate its straightforward approach to benefits.
   - **Interesting**: Slightly Agree (4) – The focus on energy and appearance is relatable but not groundbreaking for my age group.
   - **Believe in Goodness of Ad**: Moderate Agreement (5) – It feels credible given the promise of staying energized, which aligns with daily routines.
   - **Attractive**: Somewhat Agree (3.5) – The appeal to personal appearance resonates but lacks emotional depth or novelty for me.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to Purchase**: Disagree (2) – I'm cautious about new products and prioritize established brands with proven results.
   - **Try to Buy**: Neutral Tendency (4) – Might consider sampling if available at a trusted retailer, as energy drinks are part of my occasional health regimen.
   - **Consider Buying**: Strong Consideration (6) – Given the strong work ethic and desire for efficiency, staying energized is important; thus, it's on my radar but not an immediate priority. 

In summary, while I appreciate the ad's direct messaging and believe in its credibility to some extent, personal habits, caution with new products, and a preference for existing brands influence lower intent scores. Nonetheless, there's enough resonance to keep this product under consideration.
