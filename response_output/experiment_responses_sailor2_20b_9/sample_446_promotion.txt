**Detailed Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **I like the ad:** *Score = 4*
   - While not strongly disagreeing, I'm neutral to slightly positive because it aligns with wanting energy and looking good daily.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** *Score = 3* 
   - Neutral leaning towards a little bit of interest; relevant for maintaining productivity but could be more engaging.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** *Score = 5*
   - Agree it conveys benefits effectively, especially appealing to my goal-oriented nature and desire for energy boosts.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** *Score = 2* 
   - Minimal attraction due to a lack of emotional or imaginative appeal in its presentation; feels somewhat generic.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product:** *Score = 1 (Strongly Disagree)*
   - Low intent since my current financial constraints and limited disposable income don’t justify regular purchases for such products.

2. **Will try to buy this product:** *Score = 2*
   - Slightly inclined towards trying once, given its benefits but not a priority due to budget limitations.

3. **Will consider buying this product:** *Score = 3 (Neutral)*
   - Open to considering it in the future if there’s a sale or cost-effective offer aligning with my savings goals and needs.

Overall, while I appreciate the message of staying energized and looking good, practical considerations and personal preferences lead me towards cautious skepticism about immediate purchase. The ad resonates moderately but does not drive an urgent buying decision for someone in my demographic.
