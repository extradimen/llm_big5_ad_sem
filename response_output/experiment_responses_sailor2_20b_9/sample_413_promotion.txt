**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - *Like*: Neutral as it doesn't resonate strongly either way.
  - *Interesting*: Agree, due to the active imagination trait and potential appeal of staying energized and looking good.
  - *Good*: Slightly Neutral but leans toward a positive view given its practical benefits.
  - *Attractive*: Disagree slightly; while visually appealing elements might be present, personal preference isn't strongly drawn.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend to purchase*: Slight hesitation (2), indicating more consideration rather than immediate intent due to other priorities and responsibilities.
  - *Will try to buy*: Neutral leaning towards trying if the product matches needs (3).
  - *Consider buying*: Agree slightly, showing openness based on its claimed benefits but not rushing into a decision.

Overall, while there's some positive reception to the ad's messaging, purchase intent is more cautious and thoughtful rather than impulsive.
