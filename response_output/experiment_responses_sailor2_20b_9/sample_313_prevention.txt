**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad (score=3):**
  - Neutral due to its straightforwardness; not particularly appealing or off-putting.
  
- **I think the ad is interesting (score=4):**
  - Slightly positive as it targets potential health concerns and appearance, sparking mild interest.

- **I believe the ad is good (score=2):**
  - Generally low because while preventative messages are relevant, the claim feels generic without concrete evidence or compelling benefits.

- **I find the ad attractive (score=1):**
  - Strongly disagree as it lacks creativity and emotional appeal, making it unattractive to me.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product (score=2):** 
  - Low intent since the message is generic; I need stronger reasons or personal relevance.
  
- **I will try to buy this product (score=1):**
  - Very low likelihood of attempting a trial without more compelling information about efficacy and quality.

- **I will consider buying this product (score=3):**
  - Moderate consideration, acknowledging its potential but not enough to actively seek out the product right now. I might evaluate it further under different circumstances or with better advertising.

Overall, while the ad addresses common concerns, my reserved nature combined with skepticism towards such generic health claims leads to a generally unfavorable assessment and low immediate purchase intent.
