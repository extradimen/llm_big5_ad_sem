**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **I like the ad:**  
   **Score: 2 (Disagree)** - As someone strongly reserved and not particularly outgoing or sociable, I find the assertive claim about "feeling tired and looking dull" intrusive rather than engaging.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:**  
   **Score: 3 (Neutral)** - The message lacks personal appeal; it does not stimulate my interest given my preference for originality over generic health concerns.

3. **I believe the ad is good:**  
   **Score: 1 (Strongly Disagree)** - It feels manipulative, playing on fears without credible evidence to support its claim, which doesn't align with my strong critical thinking and skepticism.

4. **I find the ad attractive:**  
   **Score: 2 (Disagree)** - The tone comes off as overly dramatic and unconvincing; it's not visually or conceptually appealing for me.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:**  
   **Score: 4 (Agree)** - Even though I don't particularly like the ad, there might be a slight inclination to consider because of my helpful and unselfish nature towards improving health or wellness in general.

2. **I will try to buy this product:**  
   **Score: 5 (Strongly Agree)** - Curiosity gets piqued by addressing fatigue, especially since I prioritize thoroughness at work; a trial purchase could be motivated to verify its effectiveness.

3. **I will consider buying this product:**  
   **Score: 6 (Agree)** - Despite the critical reservations about the ad's style and credibility, my proactive approach towards maintaining energy levels makes me likely to seriously evaluate it before making a decision.

Overall, while I find the advertisement unappealing, there remains a cautious interest in exploring its potential benefits due to personal values and pragmatic tendencies.
