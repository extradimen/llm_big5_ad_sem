**Evaluation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (4/7):**
   - While I appreciate its direct message about preventing fatigue and dullness, it's not particularly exciting for me.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (5/7):**
   - The prevention of tiredness resonates somewhat because as a civil servant with my workload, energy levels matter, but it doesn't captivate me.

3. **I believe the ad is good (6/7):**
   - The message is clear and relevant to maintaining appearance and performance; hence, I find it reasonably effective in its target domain.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (3/7):**
   - It lacks visual appeal or creativity that would draw me strongly. Basic prevention-focused messaging isn't very engaging for someone with a neutral imaginative perspective.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product (2/7):**
   - While I acknowledge its usefulness, my current routine and budget allocation donâ€™t make it an immediate priority.
   
2. **Will try to buy this product (1/7):**
   - There is no strong motivation or urgency for me to seek out the drink at present.

3. **Will consider buying this product (2/7):**
   - It remains on my mental list, especially during times of increased fatigue, but not a top-of-mind purchase decision.

Overall, the ad strikes a neutral-to-positive chord with its relevance and direct benefit message, though it falls short in emotional appeal or immediate purchase motivation. My preference leans towards more engaging content paired with tangible incentives for consideration.
