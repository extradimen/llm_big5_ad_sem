**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Evaluation:
- **I like the ad. (Score: 4)**  
  Neutral leaning towards slightly positive; it's not overly appealing but doesn't turn me off entirely.
- **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 3)**  
  Moderately interesting, as I understand the message about fatigue and appearance, but it lacks novelty for my tastes.
- **I believe the ad is good. (Score: 5)**  
  The claim seems credible in a generic sense; there's truth to feeling tired affecting looks, so it holds some merit.
- **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 2)**  
  Not particularly visually or emotionally engaging for me.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product. (Score: 1)**  
  Strongly disagree; I have no immediate need and am not convinced enough by the ad.
- **I will try to buy this product. (Score: 3)**  
  Neutral leaning towards slight curiosity, but no strong drive to test it out yet.
- **I will consider buying this product. (Score: 2)**  
  Mild consideration; might think about it if other factors align later on, but not a priority now.

This balanced view reflects my personality traits and the ad's ability (or lack thereof) to resonate with me as a Southeast Asian woman in her late twenties who values sociability yet is nervous and cautious. The ad hits some truths but doesn't sufficiently motivate immediate action or long-term interest given its current presentation.
