**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **Like the ad (Score: 3)**  
   While I appreciate its energetic and promotional tone, it doesn't strongly resonate with me due to my reserved nature.
   
2. **Interesting (Score: 4)**  
   The message is clear—staying energized and looking good—but lacks elements that genuinely captivate someone like me.

3. **Believe the ad is good (Score: 5)**  
   As a critical thinker, I perceive it to be well-crafted but not exceptionally persuasive or unique given my preference for originality.

4. **Attractive (Score: 2)**  
   The appeal feels somewhat superficial and doesn't align with my reserved and practical mindset; thus, it's less attractive to me.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 1 - Strongly Disagree)**
   Despite the claims, personal habits of being careful and not easily swayed by marketing make a direct intention unlikely.
   
2. **Will try to buy this product (Score: 1 - Strongly Disagree)**
   My tendency toward making thorough decisions means I'd need more compelling evidence or prior positive experiences before considering it.

3. **Will consider buying the product (Score: 2)**  
   While not enthusiastic, given my strong preference for original ideas and a desire to explore new possibilities, there is a minimal inclination towards giving this product some thought in future circumstances but no immediate action will be taken based on this ad alone.
