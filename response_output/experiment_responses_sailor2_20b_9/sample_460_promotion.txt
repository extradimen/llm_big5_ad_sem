**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
   - **I like the ad:** Neutral (score = 3) — While not strongly negative, my balanced approach makes me somewhat indifferent.
   - **Interesting:** Agree (4) — The promise of staying energized and looking good does intrigue me to some extent.
   - **Good:** Disagree (2) — I'm skeptical about the credibility of such a claim without deeper evidence or familiar brands.
   - **Attractive:** Neutral (3) — It doesn't immediately draw me in due to mixed feelings on its claims.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to purchase this product:** Agree with some reservation (5). The idea appeals, but I'd need more information and assurances before making a definitive decision.
   - **Will try to buy the product:** Likely to give it a shot if available (6). My sociable nature means trying new things doesn't deter me entirely.
   - **Consider buying this product:** Strongly agree (7) — Given my helpful, unselfish trait and tendency towards thoroughness in some aspects, I'll consider how it aligns with personal health routines.

Overall, while the ad is intriguing enough to warrant consideration and a try, its lack of strong credibility slightly diminishes enthusiasm. However, as someone open-minded about new wellness products, there's still a high likelihood of considering or trying this product given my personality traits and goals for staying energized and looking good.
