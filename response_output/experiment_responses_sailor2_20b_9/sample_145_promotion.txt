**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **I like the ad:** Strongly Agree (6): The energetic and appearance-focused aspects resonate well with my preference for staying active and looking good, making me appreciate it.
  - **Interesting:** Neutral (5): While not groundbreaking, the message is straightforward but relevant to maintaining a daily routine efficiently.
  - **Good:** Slightly Agree (4): It delivers clear benefits but might lack emotional or imaginative depth that would elevate its quality further for someone valuing originality and creativity.
  - **Attractive:** Disagree (3): Despite liking it, the aesthetic appeal doesnâ€™t strongly draw me in. More engaging visuals could improve this aspect.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to purchase:** Somewhat Disagree (2): The ad appeals but isn't compelling enough for a guaranteed purchase; practicality will still be weighed.
  - **Try to buy:** Neutral (3): Curiosity is piqued, making it worth exploring the product through trying or sampling before committing fully.
  - **Consider buying:** Slightly Agree (4): Given my need for energy boost and maintaining appearance, there's a reasonable chance I'll evaluate this further in line with lifestyle preferences. 

Overall, while I appreciate aspects of the ad, personalization could enhance attraction and solidify purchase intent more decisively.
