**Evaluation and Reasoning:**

- **Attitudinal Scores:**  
  - **I like the ad (Score: 4):** The energetic claim appeals to my need for staying vital; however, it doesn't fully resonate due to concerns about credibility.
  - **Interesting (3):** It's moderately interesting but lacks depth and specificity which would otherwise make it more engaging.
  - **Believe it is good (2):** My general skepticism (Strongly Disagree on trust) makes me question the effectiveness, thus lowering my belief score. 
  - **Attractive (1):** The ad doesn't captivate enough with its vague benefits; I find other forms of messaging more appealing.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
  - **Intend to purchase (2):** Despite being talkative and outgoing, the lack of compelling evidence and my cautious nature prevent a strong intention.
  - **Will try (2):** There's some curiosity but not enough trust or urgency to act immediately.
  - **Consider buying (1):** I might revisit if more concrete claims or reviews surface, otherwise it stays low on my priority list.

Overall, while the ad touches on important aspects of vitality and appearance, its generic nature fails to convert strong interest into a high purchase intention due to skepticism about promises and insufficient engagement.
