**Evaluation Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
  - **Like (5/7)**: The ad appears engaging but I don't feel an overwhelming connection.
  - **Interesting (4/7)**: It captures my attention somewhat, especially with its claims about energy and appearance.
  - **Good (6/7)**: From a utility standpoint, the message is clear and appealing. Staying energized and looking good are positive attributes.
  - **Attractive (3/7)**: While not unappealing, it lacks strong visual or emotional pull for me.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to Purchase (2/7)**: Given my reserved nature and current financial situation (income range), I'm cautious about new expenses.
  - **Try to Buy (1/7)**: Low likelihood; the ad doesn't make a compelling case for immediate trial purchase.
  - **Consider Buying (2/7)**: There's mild interest, but it would depend on further research and if aligns with my needs post-review.

Overall, while I appreciate the promise of energy and aesthetics, practicality and budget constraints lead to moderate intentions without strong motivation.
