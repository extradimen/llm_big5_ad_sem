**Explanation:**

### Attitudes toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad**: Neutral to Agree (score of **5**) – As a sociable and generally trusting individual, I appreciate that the product promises energy and well-being.
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: Slightly Agree (score of **4**) – The concept resonates on some level due to my need for staying alert in daily life, but it's not overly engaging given other priorities.
3. **I believe the ad is good**: Neutral leaning towards Disagree (score of **3**) – While I acknowledge its positive messaging, there isn't enough evidence or personal relevance to strongly endorse this claim without further information.
4. **I find the ad attractive**: Slightly Disagree (score of **2**) – The promise may be appealing but lacks a compelling emotional connection for me given my practical nature.

### Purchase Intentions:
1. **Intend to purchase this product**: Strongly Disagree (score of **1**) – Despite finding it somewhat interesting, my budget constraints and cautious attitude towards new products mean I won't commit without more assurance.
2. **Will try to buy this product**: Neutral leaning Towards Agree (score of **2**) – If offered a trial size or discount, there's a slight chance; practicality overrules immediate impulse purchase.
3. **Will consider buying this product**: Agree (score of **3**) – Overall, it might be considered for future use if personal benefits align with needs and financial situation improves.

In summary, while the ad is not unappealing, its lack of strong emotional connection, combined with practical concerns about cost and necessity, results in a reserved attitude toward purchasing intentions.
