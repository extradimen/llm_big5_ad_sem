**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - I like the ad (3): It's mildly appealing due to its straightforward message but doesn't strongly resonate.
   - The ad is interesting (4): Captures some attention by addressing common concerns about energy and appearance, though not exceptionally engaging.
   - I believe the ad is good (5): Relatively neutral; it does convey a clear benefit without being convincing enough for strong endorsement.
   - I find the ad attractive (2): Lacks compelling design or emotional connection that would make it visually appealing to me.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - I intend to purchase this product (1): Strongly disagree because my tendency towards carelessness and lack of thoroughness in decision-making reduces immediate intent.
   - I will try to buy this product (2): Slightly agree; the idea of avoiding fatigue is somewhat appealing, but not enough for a definite trial.
   - I will consider buying this product (3): Neutral agreement. While it doesn't excite me, practical concerns about daily energy levels might lead me to consider purchasing in the future.

Overall, though the ad targets my potential needs effectively, its lack of emotional or visual appeal and my personal traits hinder strong purchase intention immediately but leave room for consideration down the line.
