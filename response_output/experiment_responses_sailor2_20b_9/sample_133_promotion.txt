**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:

1. **I like the ad**: `2` (Disagree)
   - The talkative and helpful nature means I appreciate engaging content, but this energy-focused drink isn't immediately appealing given my daily routine as a blue-collar worker.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**: `3` (Neutral)
   - While it's catchy, the promise of looking "your best" feels somewhat generic; more specific benefits would be better for engagement.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: `4` (Agree)
   - The message about staying energized resonates with managing a demanding job, but I'm cautious without concrete details on how it works or user testimonials.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: `5` (Slightly Agree)
   - Aiming for attractiveness in daily life is relatable; however, its appeal needs reinforcement due to my tendency toward emotional worries and carefulness about claims.

### Purchase Intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product**: `3` (Neutral)
   - The ad's messaging aligns somewhat with practical needs but isn't compelling enough alone. Additional information on efficacy or price would sway me more.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: `3` (Neutral)
   - Given my willingness to explore new products for health and energy, I'm open-minded but not strongly inclined without further evidence.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: `4` (Agree)
   - The balanced approach suggests a potential trial if it fits within budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND) and aligns with my health goals despite reservations about the ad's full persuasiveness.

Overall, while moderately positive towards the advertisement, practical considerations like cost-effectiveness and concrete benefits are crucial for me to make a purchasing decision.
