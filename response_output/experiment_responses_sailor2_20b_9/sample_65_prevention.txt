**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - *I like the ad.* (Score = 2) — While I appreciate straightforward messaging aimed at addressing daily fatigue, my preference for talkative and outgoing qualities makes me moderately indifferent to this appeal.
  - *I think the ad is interesting.* (Score = 3) — The concept of preventing tiredness and dull looks resonates slightly but isn’t enough to captivate due to my generally skeptical nature.
  - *I believe the ad is good.* (Score = 4) — It delivers a clear message, which aligns with my pragmatic approach; however, it lacks emotional resonance for me.
  - *I find the ad attractive.* (Score = 2) — The aesthetic presentation might not fully engage someone who tends towards carelessness and rudeness in interpersonal interactions.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *I intend to purchase this product.* (Score = 1) — Despite understanding its benefits, I have little motivation or urgency as my routine is quite structured.
  - *I will try to buy this product.* (Score = 2) — A slight inclination due to the preventive nature but not strong enough given other priorities and occasional rudeness.
  - *I will consider buying this product.* (Score = 2) — While I might acknowledge it as an option, practicality and emotional stability keep me from actively considering regular purchases.

Overall, while acknowledging its functional purpose, my personality traits lead to a moderate engagement with the ad without compelling purchase intentions.
