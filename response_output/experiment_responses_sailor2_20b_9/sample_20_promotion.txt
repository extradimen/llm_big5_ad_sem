**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
   - **Like (3):** While it's a functional promise of energy and appearance benefits, it doesn't personally resonate strongly given my reserved nature; thus, neutral to slightly negative reaction.
   - **Interesting (4):** Neutral leaning towards mildly interested due to its relevance to daily needs but not enough to captivate me fully.
   - **Good (5):** Agree because the claims are plausible and could be beneficial, making it a reasonable product for self-care despite my skepticism about advertising in general.
   - **Attractive (2):** Disagree as I find some promotional messages manipulative; this one feels generic rather than personally appealing.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Given the modest income and practical focus, it's a consideration but not an immediate commitment due to financial constraints.
   - **Try to Buy:** Open-minded about giving it a try if available at a fair price point and aligns with my budget for occasional self-care products.
   - **Consider Buying:** The product fits into my wellness routine, so I am likely to include it in future purchases when deciding factors (price, necessity) are favorable.

Overall, while not overly convinced by the ad's attractiveness or excitement, there is a practical appeal and potential value that could lead me towards considering purchase. It aligns with personal values of self-improvement but doesn't evoke strong emotional engagement.
