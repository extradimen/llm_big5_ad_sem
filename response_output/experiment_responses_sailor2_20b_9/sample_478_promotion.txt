   - **Attractive**: The visual appeal feels somewhat average for me, scoring at 2.

- **Purchase Intentions:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 4)**: I'm inclined but not fully committed due to reservations about immediate need and potential cost/benefit ratio.
   - **Try the product**: Curiosity is high enough that a trial feels justified, scoring at 6 out of 7.
   - **Consider buying it**: Strong consideration because of its relevance to maintaining daily energy and appearance (Score: 7).
