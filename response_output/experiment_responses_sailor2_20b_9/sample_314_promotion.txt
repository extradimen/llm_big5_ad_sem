**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like (score 4):** Neutral to slightly positive; I find it pleasant but not overwhelmingly appealing.
2. **Interesting (score 3):** Somewhat interesting as energy drinks are familiar, yet no strong novelty factor.
3. **Good (score 5):** Considered reasonable and effective in conveying the benefits without being overhyped.
4. **Attractive (score 2):** Not particularly attractive; may resonate with others but falls short on my reserved nature.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase (score 2):** Low intention, as I prioritize practical needs and this might not align directly with daily routines or budget.
2. **Try to buy (score 3):** Somewhat open-minded; willing to give it a try if offered at an affordable price point during promotions.
3. **Consider buying (score 4):** Will consider under circumstances where I need extra energy boost, like during stressful periods or special events.

This balanced evaluation reflects my reserved nature, preference for practicality, and occasional willingness to explore new products that align with daily needs without overwhelming enthusiasm.
