**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (4) - While I'm talkative and outgoing, the claim "look your best" may not strongly resonate with my personal values or current priorities.
2. **Interesting:** Disagree (3) - The message seems generic rather than innovative for me personally.
3. **Believe it's good:** Strongly Disagree (2) – Lacks specificity on how energy and appearance are improved, making the promise less credible.
4. **Attractive:** Strongly Disagree (1) - As someone who is reserved but also emotionally stable in a balanced way, this ad feels overly aspirational without substantive evidence.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase:** Agree (2) – There’s some interest due to my helpful nature and the desire for energy boost during long work hours.
2. **Will try to buy:** Agree (2) - Curiosity is piqued, but not driven enough by its claim alone to immediately make a purchase decision.
3. **Consider buying:** Slightly Agree (3) – The idea aligns with my proactive planning trait; I might evaluate it further when reviewing other similar products.

Overall, the ad does capture some attention points for me but falls short in establishing strong credibility and unique appeal tailored to my needs as an active civil servant balancing multiple responsibilities.
