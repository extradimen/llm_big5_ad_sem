**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - *I like the ad:* Agree (Score = 5) — It resonates with my need for energy and looking good, but it doesn't excite me.
   - *Interesting:* Neutral leaning positive (Score = 4) — The message is straightforward and not particularly engaging or novel to me.
   - *Good Advertisement:* Positive (Score = 6) — I find the ad well-meaning with clear benefits for daily life.
   - *Attractive:* Somewhat but not strongly attractive (Score = 3) — It lacks a compelling emotional connection, especially given my strong preference and need.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend to Purchase:* Mild intention (Score = 2) — The ad appeals moderately, but I haven't formed a firm commitment.
   - *Try the Product:* Consider trying it (Score = 3) — It's plausible for me to give it a shot based on its promise of energy and aesthetics, especially if reviews are favorable.
   - *Consider Buying:* Conditional interest (Score = 2) — The ad prompts some consideration but isn't enough to push immediate or frequent purchasing without further evidence or personal experience.

Overall, the advertisement captures my practical needs with clarity but falls short in emotional engagement. Hence, it earns a balanced yet slightly reserved set of scores.
