**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**: 
    - *I like the ad (3)*: The message seems relevant to feeling energetic and looking better, but it doesn't strongly resonate with me.
    - *Interesting (4)*: It piques mild interest due to its direct approach about avoiding fatigue and dullness.
    - *Good (2)*: While not inherently bad, I find the ad somewhat superficial in promoting a product's effect without detailed benefits or credibility.
    - *Attractive (5)*: The idea of looking refreshed is attractive but doesn't evoke strong emotions due to my cautious nature.

- **Purchase Intention**:
    - *Intend to purchase (2)*: Although I acknowledge the adâ€™s relevance, personal preference and budget considerations make me hesitant to commit fully.
    - *Try to buy (1.5)*: There's mild curiosity but not enough motivation or trust in the product given my skeptical nature.
    - *Consider buying (2.5)*: It will be on my radar if I need an energy boost, but other factors like price and brand reputation are crucial.

Overall, while the ad effectively addresses a common concern, its persuasive power is limited by my cautious personality and the lack of detailed credibility provided in this brief message.
