**Evaluation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like the Ad:** Neutral (4) — The claim about fatigue is relatable, but it doesn't particularly excite me.
   - **Interesting:** Agree (5) — It presents a clear problem to solve, making it engaging for someone aware of physical and mental weariness.
   - **Good:** Strongly Agree (6) — The message is straightforward and compelling regarding its benefits; however, effectiveness relies on credibility.
   - **Attractive:** Disagree (3) — While the concept is appealing, I need more reassurance about quality compared to other brands.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** 2 (slightly disagree) — The ad's appeal isn't strong enough for a firm commitment.
   - **Will Try to Buy:** 3 (neutral/agree slightly) — I might give it a try based on the promise, but not without considering alternatives or reviews first.
   - **Consider Buying:** 4 (agree slightly) — It definitely piques my interest; however, practical factors like price and reliability will influence the final decision.

Overall, while the ad is effective in highlighting issues that resonate with me as a young blue-collar worker who values thoroughness but also worries about appearances, it doesn't clinch immediate purchase intent due to limited trust assurance. My cautious nature requires more evidence before making a buying choice.
