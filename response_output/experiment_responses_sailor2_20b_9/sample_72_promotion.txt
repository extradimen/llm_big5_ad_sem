**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
  - *I like the ad.* – Neutral as it aligns moderately with my values of being helpful and somewhat sociable, but not strongly.
  - *Interesting* – Somewhat Agree since energizing benefits are intriguing for a daily grind office worker.
  - *Believe it's good.* – Agree because it offers practical advantages (staying energetized).
  - *Attractive* – Somewhat Agree; the focus on looking best is attractive but not compelling.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *Intend to purchase.* – Disagree, as I'm cautious and prefer tried-and-tested products.
  - *Will try to buy.* – Neutral due to some interest without commitment.
  - *Will consider buying.* – Agree; despite my reservations, the potential benefits are worth exploring.

Overall, while not overwhelmingly persuasive, the ad resonates enough for me to keep it in mind but doesn't drive an immediate purchase.
