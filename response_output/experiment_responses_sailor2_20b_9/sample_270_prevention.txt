**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3)** - While I appreciate its direct message, it lacks personal connection and creativity for me to genuinely enjoy.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)** - It presents a clear need but doesn't captivate or engage my interest enough.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5)** - The message about avoiding tiredness and looking dull has some merit, making it reasonably effective in conveying a valuable benefit.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)** - The presentation feels somewhat generic and unremarkable; not particularly appealing.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 3)** - I am open-minded but need more information or convincing factors before making a commitment.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)** - The low score reflects a cautious approach; it hasn't convinced me strongly enough yet for an immediate trial.
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3)** - There's potential interest, but additional context or reviews would influence my decision positively.

In summary, the ad effectively communicates its core message regarding fatigue and appearance but lacks elements of creativity, personal resonance, and strong visual appeal to compel a purchase without further consideration. The overall evaluation indicates moderate intent with room for improvement in advertising tactics.
