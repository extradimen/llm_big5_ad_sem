**Evaluation and Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
   - **Like (Score: 2):** Disagree slightly; while not strongly negative, the ad feels a bit generic without strong appeal to my personal tastes or needs as an individual in Southeast Asia with specific lifestyle preferences.
   - **Interesting (Score: 3):** Neutral leaning toward agreeable. The concept of feeling tired and looking dull is somewhat relatable but lacks novelty or compelling details.
   - **Good (Score: 4):** Agree; the message has a clear benefit, though it could be more engaging in its execution for me to fully appreciate.
   - **Attractive (Score: 3):** Neutral leaning slightly positive. While visually appealing and straightforward, it doesn't inspire strong emotional engagement.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase:** Moderate interest due to the perceived benefit but not high enough to make an immediate decision.
   - **Try to buy:** Similar hesitation; willing to consider trying if given a chance or promotion, but no firm commitment yet.
   - **Consider buying:** Higher consideration level as it aligns with general health and appearance concerns, though additional factors (brand reputation, price) would still need evaluation.

Overall, the ad is mildly effective in conveying its message of fatigue relief and enhanced vitality. However, my strong tendency towards carelessness and nervousness might require a more persuasive or personalized approach to truly convert interest into action. The potential health benefits resonate but are not compelling enough on their own to drive an immediate purchase. Thus, I'll keep it in consideration for future evaluation alongside other factors.
