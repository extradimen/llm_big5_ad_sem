**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like (Neutral)**: Given my reserved nature, while the ad's claims sound appealing for staying energized, it doesn't elicit strong personal enthusiasm or emotional connection.
   - **Interesting (Agree)**: The promise of energy boost and looking good is relevant to daily life challenges, making the concept intriguing enough.
   - **Good (Strongly Agree)**: As someone who values thoroughness in tasks, this ad effectively communicates clear benefits without being overly exaggerated. It seems credible and well-presented for my tastes.
   - **Attractive (Disagree)**: My reserved personality tends to find ads more on the practical side rather than overtly attractive or flashy.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend**: Despite liking parts of it, I don't feel compelled enough to immediately buy due to budget constraints and cautious nature.
   - **Try (Consider)**: My strong agreement with its credibility leads me to be open-minded about trying the product if offered at a reasonable price or in a trial format.
   - **Consider** (Strongly Agree): The alignment between my daily needs for energy and appearance makes it a logical candidate under appropriate circumstances, thus I will seriously consider purchasing.

Overall, while the ad resonates well on some levels (credibility, relevance), my reserved and budget-conscious nature limits immediate intent to purchase but leaves room for future consideration.
