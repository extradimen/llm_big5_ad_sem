**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement (Prevention Type):**
  - **Like:** *2* — While I appreciate its straightforward message targeting fatigue and appearance concerns, my reserved nature means it doesn't particularly excite me.
  - **Interesting:** *3* — It's informative but lacks engagement or creativity that might grab my attention fully.
  - **Good:** *4* — The ad effectively highlights the problem (feeling tired) and suggests a solution, making it somewhat credible from an informational standpoint.
  - **Attractive:** *3* — Despite its clear appeal to personal well-being, my reserved personality finds it slightly less appealing.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend:** *5* — The product seems relevant due to my busy lifestyle as a managerial employee. However, I need more convincing factors beyond the ad.
  - **Try:** *6* — Given its potential benefits and minimal risk (assuming good reviews), it's reasonable for me to give it a trial run.
  - **Consider:** *7* — The clear messaging nudges me towards serious consideration despite initial reservations. My helpful nature also appreciates addressing fatigue, making the idea of buying more likely.

Overall, while I'm not fully won over by the ad, its practical approach aligns with my lifestyle concerns, pushing my purchase intention significantly higher.
