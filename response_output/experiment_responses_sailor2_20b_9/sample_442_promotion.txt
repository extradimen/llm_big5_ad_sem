**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:** 
  - **I like the ad (Score: 3):** Neutral leaning towards slight dislike due to my reserved nature and occasional rudeness; not particularly engaging.
  - **Interesting (Score: 4):** Somewhat interesting, but lacks depth in appeal for someone who is neutral about originality or creativity.
  - **Good (Score: 2):** Slightly disagreeable—doesn't meet high standards of credibility given my general skepticism and slight dislike towards thoroughness.
  - **Attractive (Score: 3):** Neutral with a slight leaning towards not finding it attractive. It’s generic energy drink messaging, which doesn’t resonate strongly.

- **Purchase Intention:** 
  - **Intend to purchase (Score: 1):** Strongly disagree; despite being an office worker needing energy boosts, the ad lacks strong personal appeal.
  - **Will try to buy (Score: 2):** Slightly agree—might give it a chance if recommended by peers but not driven internally.
  - **Consider buying (Score: 2):** Neutral leaning towards consideration; open to trying due to occasional curiosity, but no firm commitment.

Overall, the ad isn't compelling enough based on my personality traits and preferences. While I might consider sampling due to external influences or necessity, it doesn’t strongly drive a purchase decision by itself.
