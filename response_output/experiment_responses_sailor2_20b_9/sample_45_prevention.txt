   - **3. I believe the ad is good:** (Score = 5) It effectively communicates potential benefits and could be helpful for those needing energy boosts.
   - **4. I find the ad attractive:** (Score = 2) While informative, its appeal is limited due to lack of emotional or creative elements.

- **Purchase Intention**
   - **1. I intend to purchase this product:** (Score = 4) The need for an energy boost is acknowledged but not strong enough to drive immediate action.
   - **2. I will try to buy this product:** (Score = 3) It might be considered under specific circumstances, like needing quick relief from tiredness.
   - **3. I will consider buying this product:** (Score = 6) Given the focus on practical benefits and my helpful nature, it's likely that I'd evaluate it further if encountering a need or opportunity.
