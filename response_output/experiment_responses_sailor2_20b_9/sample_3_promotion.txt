**Evaluation and Rationale:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad (Score: 5)**:
   - While I appreciate its focus on energy and appearance, as a young adult who values authenticity over flashy promises, my enthusiasm is moderate.

2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)**:
   - The concept of looking best daily might intrigue me slightly, but it doesn't stand out enough to grab attention given my preference for practicality.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 6)**:
   - It effectively communicates key benefits—energizing and enhancing appearance—which aligns with common goals; hence, I find some value in its messaging.

4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3)**:
   - The appeal is limited for me due to a neutral stance on visual engagement and more focus on substance over looks.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)**:
   - While my desire for energy boosters isn’t high, the overall message resonates slightly without compelling urgency.

2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 1)**:
   - Given limited financial resources (<15,000,000 VND/month), I'm not inclined to make an effort towards trying new products unless proven necessity or better value is demonstrated.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3)**:
   - There's a slight possibility of considering it if other factors align—such as discounts, reviews, or specific needs surfacing during the day-to-day routine—but not enough to actively pursue purchase.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad’s message and find parts appealing, my reserved nature coupled with practical financial considerations result in moderate interest but low immediate purchasing intent. Further incentives might sway me slightly towards consideration.
