**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad (Score: 4):**
  - As a talkative and somewhat outgoing person, I find some appeal in it. The energy boost aspect aligns with my need to stay productive.
  
- **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 3):**
  - Neutral interest; while not captivating, the concept of staying energized resonates at a basic level.

- **I believe the ad is good (Score: 2):**
  - Somewhat skeptical given my reserved nature and cautious approach to product claims. Need more evidence or reviews before fully believing it.
  
- **I find the ad attractive (Score: 5):**
  - Slightly higher due to its focus on looking best, which adds a social element that appeals slightly but not strongly.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 3):** 
  - Neutral leaning towards low; while I appreciate staying energized, the limited budget and skeptical nature prevent strong intent.
  
- **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2):**
  - A bit hesitant but willing to consider a small trial. Affordability is key.

- **I will consider buying this product (Score: 1):** 
  - Low score; despite the ad, my current financial constraints and desire for cautious spending mean I'm unlikely to commit unless convinced by further reassurance or discount offers. 

Overall, while there's some positive engagement due to being talkative and goal-oriented, practical concerns like cost and skepticism about product claims lower the intent to purchase significantly.
