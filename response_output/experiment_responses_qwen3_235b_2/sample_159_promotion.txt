Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 40-49 year old Chinese female office worker with high school education, married, earning under 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm reserved (Agree), not very thorough (Disagree), get nervous easily (Agree), but don't worry much (Strongly Disagree). I'm not particularly trusting (Strongly Disagree) and have some artistic interests (Disagree with having few).

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as someone who's reserved and not very trusting, I'd be skeptical. Office work is tiring but I've seen too many exaggerated claims. The "look your best" part feels superficial - at my age with my income, I'm more practical than image-focused. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): Strongly disagree. Feels like empty promises.
- Interesting (2): Barely neutral. Maybe slightly disagree since it's generic.
- Good (1): Strongly disagree. Doesn't address real needs.
- Attractive (1): Strongly disagree. Flashy but meaningless to me.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Absolutely not. Too skeptical.
- Try (2): Might glance at it once but no commitment.
- Consider (3): Only if there's concrete proof, which there isn't.

My nervousness (Agree) makes me avoid unproven products. With low trust and thoroughness (Disagree), I won't research it either. The ad feels like those I see on cheap billboards - irrelevant to my daily commute stress.
