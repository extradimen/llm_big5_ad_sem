Alright, let's tackle this. So, I'm supposed to evaluate this ad based on the given demographic and personality traits. First, I need to really understand who this person is. 

Okay, Chinese male, under 20, but wait—he's a civil servant with a bachelor's degree? That seems a bit young for a civil servant with a degree, but maybe in some systems it's possible. Divorced at under 20? That's unusual, but maybe it's a typo or cultural context I'm missing. Monthly income over 46 million VND, which is about $1,800 USD. For a civil servant in China, that's actually pretty high, especially for someone under 20. Maybe it's a special position or the currency conversion is off, but I'll go with the given info.

Personality traits: He's not talkative, disagrees with being outgoing, agrees with being reserved. So he's introverted. He's helpful, trusting, not rude. But he disagrees with doing a thorough job and strongly disagrees with making plans. Also, strongly disagrees with being careless? Wait, that seems contradictory. If he doesn't do thorough jobs and doesn't follow plans, but isn't careless... Hmm, maybe he's inconsistent or spontaneous. He's emotionally stable (strongly agree), has an active imagination, comes up with new ideas, and disagrees with having few artistic interests—so he's creative.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Now, as this person, how would he react? He's reserved, introverted, not into socializing. The ad is about staying energized and looking good. But since he's a civil servant, maybe his job isn't super physically demanding? Or maybe he needs energy for work. But he's emotionally stable, doesn't get nervous easily, so maybe he doesn't feel the need for an energy boost. Also, he's creative (artistic interests), so maybe he values authenticity. The ad seems pretty generic—vague claims without specifics. "Look your best" is subjective. As someone who's reserved and not into flashy stuff, he might find this ad superficial. 

He's helpful and trusting, but the ad doesn't tap into helping others—it's self-focused. Maybe he doesn't relate. Also, he doesn't make plans, so spontaneous, but the ad is about daily use ("every day"). He might not be into committing to a daily routine since he doesn't follow through on plans. 

Purchase intention: He's emotionally stable, so maybe doesn't feel the need for energy drinks. Also, as a civil servant in China, maybe he prefers tea or traditional drinks. The ad doesn't mention any specific benefits that align with his traits. He's creative, but the ad isn't innovative—it's a standard energy drink claim. 

Attitude toward ad: He'd probably find it uninteresting and not attractive. Since he's reserved, flashy ads might not appeal. He values thoroughness? Wait, no—he disagrees with doing a thorough job. But he strongly disagrees with being careless. So maybe he's inconsistent but doesn't want to seem careless. The ad's vagueness might rub him the wrong way. He might think it's not credible. 

So for ad attitude: 
- Like: low, maybe 2. He's reserved, not into hype.
- Interesting: 3. Neutral because he has imagination but the ad isn't creative.
- Good: 2. Doesn't seem well-made to him.
- Attractive: 2. Not visually appealing to his reserved nature.

Purchase intention:
- Intend: 1. No plan to buy.
- Try: 2. Maybe out of curiosity but unlikely.
- Consider: 3. Slightly higher, but still low since he's not into such products.

Wait, he's trusting, so maybe he'd believe the ad? But he's also creative and original, so might see through marketing fluff. The ad lacks specifics, so even though he's trusting, the vagueness might make him skeptical. 

Also, his high income might mean he can afford it, but his personality (reserved, not into self-promotion) might not care about "looking your best." Civil servants in China might prioritize practicality over appearance. 

So scores would be low across the board. Ad doesn't resonate with his introverted, creative, stable personality. Purchase intention almost nonexistent.
