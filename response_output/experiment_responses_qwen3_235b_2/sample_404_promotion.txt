Alright, let's tackle this. So, I need to evaluate this ad as a specific persona. Let me break down the persona first.

The user is a Chinese female over 60, divorced, with a bachelor's degree, currently a student. Monthly income is 36-45 million VND, which is quite high. Personality traits: reserved (strongly agree), not outgoing (disagree), not talkative (neutral), not helpful/unselfish (disagree), not trusting (strongly disagree), not rude (strongly disagree), not careless (strongly disagree), worries a lot (agree), emotionally stable (agree), active imagination (strongly agree), not original (strongly disagree), few artistic interests (agree).

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

First, attitude toward the ad. The persona is reserved, not trusting, worries a lot. The ad is vague—no specifics on how it works, ingredients, or evidence. As someone who's not trusting, she'd be skeptical. Also, she's over 60; "look your best" might feel irrelevant or even insulting, implying she doesn't look her best now. Her active imagination might make her think of negative scenarios (e.g., side effects), but she's not into artistic stuff, so maybe not. She worries a lot, so the claim might raise concerns about false promises.

Purchase intention: High income, but she's a student? That's odd—maybe retired person studying? Anyway, she's careful (not careless), emotionally stable but worries. The ad doesn't provide enough info for her to trust it. She's not helpful/unselfish, so altruistic angles won't work, but this ad isn't that. She might consider it if there were more details, but as is, low intent.

Scoring: Ad attitude—like, interesting, good, attractive. She'd disagree with all because of skepticism and irrelevance. Maybe neutral on "good" if she thinks it's well-made but not convincing. But given strong distrust, scores low. Purchase intention: all low since no trust, no specifics. She might "consider" slightly higher (3) because she's thorough, but still skeptical.
