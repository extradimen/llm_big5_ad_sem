Okay, let me step into the shoes of this 50-59 year old Chinese male managerial employee. Divorced, high school education, income over 46 million VND monthly. His personality traits are key here—he's reserved (Agree), not talkative or sociable (Disagree/Strongly Disagree), emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagree meaning he's unstable), original with new ideas (Agree), but not artistic. He's trusting (Strongly Agree) yet not helpful/unselfish (Disagree), and admits to being careless (Agree). 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a reserved, emotionally unstable guy in his 50s managing a job, he's probably skeptical. He's not social, so "look your best" feels superficial—divorced men might not care about appearance-focused claims. "Stay energized" could resonate with work stress, but his "careless" trait means he might skip daily routines. His "original ideas" trait suggests he'd see through vague promises—no specifics about how it works. 

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad" (1): Too flashy for a reserved person. He'd hate the "look your best" fluff. 
- "Interesting" (2): Maybe mildly curious but distrusts ads. 
- "Good" (1): Feels manipulative—no proof, just empty claims. 
- "Attractive" (1): Visuals probably don't appeal to his no-nonsense side. 

Purchase intention: 
- "Intend to buy" (1): He's unselfish? No—he Disagrees, so he's self-focused but this ad doesn't solve his real problems (emotional instability, work stress). 
- "Will try" (2): Might humor it once due to trust, but "careless" means he won't follow through. 
- "Consider" (3): Slight openness because he's trusting, but "emotionally unstable" makes him impulsive—maybe if stressed, but low priority. 

Gotta be critical. He's not the target—ads like this scream "young professionals," not divorced managers. Scores stay low.
