Okay, let's tackle this step by step. I'm a Chinese male student in my 20s with high school education, single, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm strongly agree with being helpful/unselfish and generally trusting, but strongly disagree with being outgoing or having emotional stability. I worry a lot and have few artistic interests.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a student, energy is important for studying, but the ad feels too vague. "Look your best" sounds superficial - I strongly agree I have few artistic interests, so beauty claims might not resonate. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? Neutral (4) - not offensive but generic. 
- Interesting? Disagree (2) - no unique hook for me. 
- Good? Below average (3) - lacks substance. 
- Attractive? Low (2) - plain claim without proof.

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? Absolutely not (1) - too skeptical. 
- Will try? Maybe if cheap (2) - but I strongly agree I worry a lot, so doubtful. 
- Consider? Slightly (3) - only if peers recommend it, since I'm trusting.

Wait, my income is high for a student (36-45M VND â‰ˆ $1,500), but I'm still frugal. The ad doesn't address student needs like affordability or study focus. "Look your best" feels targeted at fashion-conscious people, but I strongly disagree with being outgoing and have few artistic interests. 

Also, I strongly agree I worry a lot - so unverified health claims ("stay energized") might trigger skepticism. No ingredients or science mentioned. As someone who "does a thorough job" (strongly agree), I'd want more details before considering. 

Final scores make sense: ad is unremarkable (2-3 range), purchase intent very low (1-3) because it feels irrelevant to my practical, worry-prone student life.
