Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to embody a very specific Chinese male persona with unusual traits: under 20, divorced (which feels odd for that age), extremely high income in VND range, and strongly introverted personality. 

First, I need to unpack the demographic contradictions. A 20-year-old divorcee with 26-35 million VND monthly income (~$1,000-$1,400 USD) is plausible in Vietnam, but the "Bachelor's degree" at <20 suggests accelerated education. The personality traits scream INTJ or ISTJ - super reserved, distrustful, careless about thoroughness but emotionally stable. Key red flags: "sometimes rude" and "few artistic interests" strongly.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Classic vague health/beauty claim. For someone who:
- Strongly disagrees with being talkative/social (so hates "look your best" social pressure)
- Is distrustful (will see through generic claims)
- Has no artistic interests (won't care about aesthetics)
- Is original but careless (might dismiss it as unoriginal marketing)

This ad is practically designed to annoy him. The "look your best" part especially clashes with his reserved nature - he probably avoids attention. The energy claim might register since he's young, but with his distrust, he'll assume it's just caffeine/sugar. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like? Hard no (1) - too salesy for his taste
- Interesting? Maybe 2 - only as a case study in bad ads
- Good? Absolutely not (1) - feels manipulative
- Attractive? 1 - zero visual/emotional pull for him

Purchase intention:
- Intend? 1 - no way
- Try? 2 - only if free sample, but wouldn't seek it
- Consider? 3 - might glance at ingredients out of scientific curiosity, but stops there

The high income doesn't matter here - he's not status-driven (disagrees with sociable traits). His originality trait makes him immune to basic claims. Only reason scores aren't all 1s is that as a young male, he might marginally care about energy... but the distrust kills even that.
