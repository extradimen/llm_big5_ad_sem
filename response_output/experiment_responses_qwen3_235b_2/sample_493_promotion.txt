Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 40-49 year old Chinese female civil servant with a postgraduate degree, single, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm strongly disagree with being talkative, disagree with being outgoing, neutral on being reserved, strongly agree with being helpful/unselfish, agree with being trusting, neutral on being sometimes rude, neutral on doing thorough job, disagree with making/following plans, strongly disagree with being careless, neutral on getting nervous, agree with worrying a lot, strongly agree with being emotionally stable, neutral on active imagination, neutral on being original, and disagree with having few artistic interests.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a civil servant with a postgraduate background, I'd be skeptical of vague health claims. My strong "helpful/unselfish" trait means I'd question if this is genuinely beneficial or just marketing. Being emotionally stable but a worrier, I'd focus on credibility - no scientific evidence or brand mentioned makes it feel superficial. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): Strongly disagree. The ad feels generic and doesn't align with my reserved nature. Vague claims annoy my "thorough job" neutrality.
- Interesting (2): Disagree. As someone who worries about health claims, this oversimplification seems irresponsible. 
- Good (3): Neutral-leaning low. My trust (agree) is betrayed by lack of substance, but civil service professionalism keeps me from full rejection.
- Attractive (2): Disagree. No artistic appeal (I disagree with "few artistic interests"), and "look your best" feels superficial for my age/role.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Strongly disagree. My "careless" strong disagreement means I'd research proper energy solutions. 
- Try (2): Disagree. As a planner-disliker who still avoids carelessness, I wouldn't risk unverified products.
- Consider (3): Neutral. My helpful nature makes me open to others' recommendations, but zero ad credibility gives no reason to consider.

This aligns with my profile: skeptical due to education, unimpressed by hype due to emotional stability, and prioritizing substance over marketing fluff. The ad's vagueness clashes with my thoroughness tendencies despite not being a strict planner.
