Okay, let me step into the shoes of this virtual person based on the demographic and personality profile provided. 

First, I need to fully understand who this person is. He's a Chinese male in his 40s, divorced, with a bachelor's degree but working as a blue-collar worker. His monthly income is 16-25 million VND, which is decent but not high for someone with his education level. Interesting that he has a degree but is in blue-collar work - maybe he couldn't find better opportunities or had setbacks after divorce.

Looking at his personality traits: He's not talkative or sociable (strongly disagrees with being outgoing and reserved, which is confusing but suggests he's neither - perhaps just average). He's generally trusting (strongly agree) but gets nervous easily (strongly agree) and worries a lot. He's emotionally stable though, which seems contradictory but maybe means he manages anxiety well. He does plans and follows through (agree), but doesn't do thorough jobs (strongly disagree) and isn't creative (strongly disagrees with originality). 

The ad is super simple: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a blue-collar worker doing physical labor, energy is relevant - he'd need stamina for work. But "look your best" feels superficial for a middle-aged divorced man focused on daily survival. 

Considering his traits:
- His strong trust might make him believe claims initially
- But his nervousness/worry could make him skeptical of vague promises
- Low thoroughness means he won't research validity
- Not being original suggests he prefers practical over flashy ads

The ad feels too generic. No proof, no brand name, nothing specific. As someone who follows plans but isn't thorough, he might think "maybe useful" but won't be convinced. His neutral stance on helpfulness means he won't buy just to be unselfish. 

For ad attitude:
- Like? Probably not - too shallow for his pragmatic mindset (low score)
- Interesting? Vague claims aren't engaging (low)
- Good? Feels manipulative without evidence (low)
- Attractive? No visual described, but wording feels insincere (low)

Purchase intention:
- Won't intend to buy - needs concrete proof
- Might "try" if cheap/sold at worksite (slightly higher)
- Will "consider" since energy claim is relevant to his job (highest score)

I'm scoring ad attitude very low (2s) because it's unconvincing to a skeptical blue-collar worker. Purchase intention slightly higher for "consider" (3) since energy matters for his job, but still low overall because he's not impulsive.
