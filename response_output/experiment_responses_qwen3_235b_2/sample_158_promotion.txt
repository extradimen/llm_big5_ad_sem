Okay, let me approach this as the specified persona. I'm a 30-39 year old Chinese male student with a postgraduate degree, divorced, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm talkative but strongly reserved, highly helpful/unselfish yet distrustful, with strong planning skills but dislike thoroughness. I'm nervous but don't worry much, have active imagination but few artistic interests.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, ad attitude assessment:
- Like (1): As someone who's reserved and distrustful, generic health claims feel manipulative. Strongly disagree.
- Interesting (2): My active imagination might engage with creative ads, but this is too vague. Disagree.
- Good (2): "Thorough job" trait is Disagree, so I'd spot lack of evidence. Poor execution.
- Attractive (1): Reserved nature + distrust makes flashy claims unappealing. Strong dislike.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Distrustful + nervous about claims = zero intent. Strongly disagree.
- Try (2): Might experiment if peer-recommended, but ad alone isn't enough. Disagree.
- Consider (3): As a planner, I'd research alternatives first. Slight openness but still skeptical.

Key conflicts: 
- Helpful trait vs distrust: Want to believe it helps others but can't trust the claim
- Nervousness vs emotional stability: The "look your best" pressure triggers anxiety
- Active imagination vs few artistic interests: Appreciates creativity but rejects superficiality

The ad fails because:
1) No proof for "energized/look best" claims (triggers distrust)
2) "Look your best" conflicts with my reserved nature (feels vain)
3) As a planner, I need concrete details it doesn't provide
4) Income level means I'm selective about health products

Final scores reflect deep skepticism from my specific trait combination - especially how "strongly reserved" and "disagree on trusting" override any positive traits like talkativeness.
