Okay, let me step into the shoes of this Chinese civil servant. He's a 20-29 year old male with a bachelor's degree, married, earning under 15 million VND monthly. His personality traits are key here. 

First, looking at his traits: he strongly disagrees with being talkative or reserved, which is interesting - he's probably somewhere in the middle socially. Neutral on helpfulness and trust, so he's not overly altruistic or suspicious. Agrees he's sometimes rude? That's notable - maybe he has blunt tendencies. Strongly disagrees with being careless, so he values precision. Disagrees about worrying but also disagrees about being emotionally stable... that's contradictory, but maybe means he has mood swings without constant anxiety. Most importantly: strongly agrees he's original and comes up with new ideas! But disagrees on having active imagination? Hmm, perhaps he sees himself as practical innovator rather than daydreamer.

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Classic functional benefit claim. 

Considering his civil servant job - low income bracket, probably health-conscious but skeptical of quick fixes. His "sometimes rude" trait makes me think he'd roll his eyes at vague promises. "Look your best" feels shallow for someone who's original (strongly agrees) but has few artistic interests (neutral). He'd want concrete proof, not fluff. 

His "do a thorough job" being neutral suggests he won't research deeply, but "tend to be careless" strongly disagree means he notices shoddy claims. The ad gives zero specifics - no ingredients, no evidence. As an original thinker (strong agree), he'd spot the clich√© immediately. 

Married with modest income? Probably prioritizes family needs over self-care products. "Stay energized" might resonate with work demands, but "look your best" feels irrelevant - civil servants don't need flashy appearances. 

Biggest red flag: his "emotionally stable" disagreement combined with "worry a lot" disagreement. He's probably pragmatic but not easily swayed by emotional appeals. This ad is pure aspiration with no substance. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? Hard no - too generic (score 2)
- Interesting? Only as a bad example (score 3)
- Good? Missing credibility (score 2)
- Attractive? Visuals aren't described, but claim is weak (score 3)

Purchase intention:
Zero intention - he'd dismiss it as another overhyped drink. Might consider only if evidence emerged, but ad provides none. "Consider" gets a 3 because... well, maybe if wife suggested it? But unlikely.
