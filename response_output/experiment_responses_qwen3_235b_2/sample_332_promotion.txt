Alright, let's tackle this step by step. I need to evaluate this advertisement as if I'm the virtual person described. First, I'll go over her demographic and personality traits to get into her mindset.

She's a 30-39 year old Chinese female student with a postgraduate degree. Divorced, with a monthly income of 16-25 million VND. Her personality traits: strongly agree she's talkative, helpful, unselfish, and tends to be careless. She agrees she's outgoing but also reserved, has an active imagination, and has few artistic interests. She strongly disagrees with being generally trusting and sometimes rude. She strongly disagrees with making plans and following through, but strongly agrees she worries a lot and does a thorough job. Neutral on emotional stability, disagrees on being original.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

Now, assessing her attitude toward the ad. She's talkative and sociable but also reserved. She's helpful but not trusting. She worries a lot and is careless. The ad is very generic. As a postgraduate student, she might value specifics and evidence. The ad lacks details—what's in the drink? How does it work? Since she's not trusting (strongly disagrees), vague claims like "stay energized and look your best" might seem unconvincing. She does thorough work but is careless, so maybe she'd notice the lack of substance but also overlook it sometimes. However, her high worry tendency might make her skeptical. Also, as a student, she might be on a budget despite her income, so efficacy matters.

Ad attitude scores:
1. Like the ad: Probably not. Generic ads might annoy her. She's critical (does thorough job), so 2.
2. Interesting: Maybe neutral? But without specifics, not really. She has active imagination but disagrees on originality. Still, the ad isn't creative. Maybe 3.
3. Believes it's good: As a thorough worker, she'd expect better. Strongly disagrees on trust, so low score. 2.
4. Attractive: Vague claim, not appealing to her. She's reserved, so flashy ads might not work. 2.

Purchase intention:
She worries a lot and isn't trusting. The ad doesn't provide proof, so she won't believe it. She's careless but does thorough jobs—conflict here, but skepticism wins. As a student, she might look for affordable options, but the ad doesn't mention price. Income is decent, but without trust, no purchase. 

1. Intend to purchase: Strongly disagree. 1.
2. Will try to buy: Unlikely without evidence. 1.
3. Will consider: Maybe if there's more info, but ad alone? She worries a lot, so probably not. But "consider" is softer. Still, low. 2.

Wait, she's helpful and unselfish. Could the ad's "look your best" appeal to her sociability? But she's reserved and not trusting. Probably not enough to sway her. Also, "look your best" might seem superficial, and as a postgrad student, she might prioritize substance over appearance. Her few artistic interests might make "look your best" less relevant.

Double-checking: She strongly agrees she worries a lot. Vague health claims could trigger skepticism. No ingredients or studies mentioned, so she'd doubt efficacy. Purchase intention should be very low. Ad attitude also low because it's not credible to her.
