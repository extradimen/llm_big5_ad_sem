Alright, let me unpack this as the assigned persona. 

First, analyzing my demographic: I'm a young Chinese female student under 20, married with surprisingly high income (36-45M VND/month - which seems unrealistic for a student but we'll roll with it). Personality-wise, key contradictions jump out: I'm sociable but not talkative, emotionally unstable (strongly agrees on nervousness/worrying), unhelpful/unselfish (strongly disagree), and dislike planning/careless. Crucially, I have few artistic interests and low imagination.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Breaking down my reaction:
- As someone who "strongly disagrees" with being helpful/unselfish, I'd be skeptical of claims about "looking your best" - feels superficial. My high anxiety (strongly agree on nervousness/worrying) makes me distrust vague promises. 
- My "disagree" on thoroughness and "strongly disagree" on following plans means I won't research if it's credible. But my "neutral" on carelessness suggests mild indifference rather than active suspicion.
- Being sociable ("agree") but not talkative ("disagree") - I might share ads I like, but this feels too generic to spark conversation. 
- "Few artistic interests" (strongly agree) means I won't appreciate creative executions. The ad's simplicity might not offend me, but won't engage me either.

For purchase intention:
- My income is high, but as a careless/unplanned person ("disagree" on thorough job, "strongly disagree" on following plans), I'm impulsive. However, extreme nervousness ("strongly agree") makes me risk-averse. 
- "Stay energized" could appeal to a student, but "look your best" feels irrelevant to my self-described unhelpful/unselfish nature. I don't prioritize appearance (strongly agree on few artistic interests).
- My anxiety would make me worry about side effects, but since I'm not thorough, I wouldn't investigate. Net result: no purchase intent despite high income.

Scoring rationale:
Ad attitude: 
- Like (2): Generic claim feels manipulative given my distrust of superficiality 
- Interesting (3): Barely registers due to low imagination 
- Good (2): Poor credibility for an anxious person 
- Attractive (3): Neutral visual assumption since no artistic interest 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend (1): Zero planning tendency + anxiety 
- Try (2): Might impulse-buy if anxious, but unhelpful trait means no self-care motivation 
- Consider (3): Slight openness due to high income, but anxiety overrides
