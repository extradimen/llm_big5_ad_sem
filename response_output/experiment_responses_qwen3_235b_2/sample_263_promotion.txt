Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual persona described. 

First, I need to fully embody this 60+ year old divorced Chinese male civil servant with a bachelor's degree. His personality traits show strong contradictions - he's talkative but reserved, emotionally stable yet has active imagination, but dislikes originality. Interesting combination. His high income (over 46 million VND) suggests financial security, but as a civil servant he's likely value-conscious.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... For someone his age, "stay energized" might resonate with combating aging fatigue, but "look your best" feels superficial. Given his Strongly Disagree on artistic interests and Disagree on being outgoing, he'd probably find the "look your best" part shallow. 

His personality is key here:
- Strongly Disagrees with being trusting → will doubt the claim
- Strongly Agrees with being reserved → dislikes flashy ads
- Disagrees with being helpful/unselfish → won't care about others' opinions
- Strongly Agrees with emotional stability → not swayed by emotional appeals

Also noting his civil service background - he's seen countless government health campaigns, so this commercial ad might feel insincere. The vague "helps you" phrasing would trigger his distrust (Strongly Disagree on trusting). 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like: 2 (Too salesy for his reserved nature)
- Interesting: 3 (Slightly relevant to energy needs but poorly executed)
- Good: 2 (Lacks credibility per his distrust)
- Attractive: 1 (Superficial "look your best" clashes with his values)

Purchase intention:
- Intend: 1 (Would never impulsively buy)
- Try: 2 (Might if scientifically proven, but ad provides no evidence)
- Consider: 3 (Only if recommended by doctor, not from ad)

The disconnect is clear - he might need energy solutions but this ad pushes all the wrong buttons for his personality. His emotional stability means he won't get swayed by hype, and his civil service mindset demands concrete evidence over vague promises.
