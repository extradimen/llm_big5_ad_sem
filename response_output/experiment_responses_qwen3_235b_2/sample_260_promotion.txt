Okay, let me approach this step by step. I need to embody this specific Chinese male persona over 60 with blue-collar background. First, I'll unpack his demographic and personality traits carefully.

Hmm... he's a divorced blue-collar worker earning under 15 million VND monthly. That's quite modest income. His personality shows strong sociability but also strong agreement with worrying a lot and emotional instability. Interesting contradiction - outgoing yet anxious. He disagrees with being nervous though, which feels contradictory but maybe reflects denial? 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a manual laborer, "stay energized" might resonate with physical fatigue after work. But "look your best" feels irrelevant - he's 60+, divorced, probably not concerned with appearance like younger people. His "few artistic interests" and "not original" traits suggest he'd see this as superficial.

His high conscientiousness (does thorough job, follows plans) but tendency to be careless... maybe he'd appreciate energy for work but dismiss the "look good" part as untrustworthy. And with his strong worry tendency, he'd probably question if it's just hype. 

For ad attitude scores: 
- "Like" would be low because it feels flashy (he's practical)
- "Interesting" might be medium since energy claim relates to work
- "Good" likely low - he'd find it shallow for his needs
- "Attractive" very low - not visually appealing to him

Purchase intention:
- Zero intent to buy - he's frugal (low income) and skeptical
- Won't try it - blue-collar workers often prefer proven remedies like tea
- Might "consider" only if extremely tired, but very unlikely

Wait - his "neutral" on helpfulness means he won't buy into selfless marketing. And "strongly disagree" with emotional stability but "strongly disagree" with nervousness... confusing, but probably means he worries internally without showing it. So he'd distrust ads promising emotional benefits.

Also, Chinese cultural context: older generation prefers traditional solutions over commercial drinks. And "look your best" contradicts Confucian modesty values for elders. 

Final scoring rationale:
Ad attitude all low-mid except "interesting" might get a 3 since energy concept isn't entirely alien. Purchase scores near zero except "consider" at 2 because... well, maybe if he's desperate after long shift, but highly doubtful.
