Okay, let me approach this step by step. I need to embody this Chinese male office worker over 60 with specific traits and income level. 

First, looking at his personality profile: he's not talkative or sociable (Strongly Disagree on outgoing), but interestingly Disagrees with being reserved - maybe he's quietly social? He's Agree on being helpful/unselfish and Strongly Agree on trusting, which feels important. But he also Agrees he's careless and worries a lot - that anxiety might color how he sees ads.

Hmm, the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a retired office worker (since >60 and divorced), he's probably not chasing "looking your best" like younger folks. His high school education means he'll prefer straightforward claims, but his Strongly Agree on trusting might make him initially receptive... though his Agree on worrying suggests skepticism.

His monthly income is 26-35 million VND - that's actually quite high for Vietnam (about $1,100-$1,500 USD), but as a retired person, he might be cautious with spending. The ad feels too vague for someone who "does a thorough job" (Agree trait) but "tends to be careless" (also Agree - contradiction? Maybe he tries to be thorough but slips up).

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad" - probably low. It's not for his demographic (older man), and he's not sociable so flashy ads won't appeal. Maybe 2.
- "Interesting" - his Strongly Disagree on imagination means he won't find creative ads engaging. Solid 1.
- "Believe it's good" - he's trusting but worries a lot. Might think "too good to be true." I'd say 3.
- "Attractive" - neutral on artistic interests, but ad feels shallow for him. 2.

Purchase intention:
- "Intend to purchase" - no way. He's careless but not impulsive, and the product doesn't solve his stated needs. 1.
- "Will try" - his Agree on worrying means he'll avoid unproven things. 1.
- "Will consider" - maybe? But as a thorough worker (Agree trait), he'd want evidence. Still, vague claims won't cut it. 2.

Wait - his high income might make him less price-sensitive, but the ad doesn't leverage that. And "look your best" feels irrelevant for a divorced 60+ man who's not sociable. He'd probably think "This is for young people."

*Double-checking traits*: 
- Strongly Agree trusting → but also Agree on worrying → likely cautious despite trust. 
- Disagrees with making plans → so "consider buying" might be higher? But no, his thoroughness (Agree) would make him research first. 

Final scores feel right: ad attitude very low (1-3 range), purchase intention near zero except maybe "consider" at 2 because he's helpful/trusting but practical.
