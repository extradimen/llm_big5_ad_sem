Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual persona described. 

First, I need to fully embody this Chinese female civil servant in her 20s-30s with a postgraduate degree. Her profile shows she's highly sociable (Strongly Agree to outgoing), unselfish (Strongly Agree to helpful), but also careless (Strongly Agree) and occasionally rude (Agree). Interesting contradictions here - very trusting yet careless, emotionally stable but sometimes rude. Her income is solid (26-35M VND/month) but as a civil servant, she's probably budget-conscious.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... extremely generic. No product name, no specifics. As a detail-oriented civil servant (despite her "careless" trait), she'd notice the vagueness. Her "do a thorough job: Disagree" suggests she might overlook details, but her "make plans: Strongly Agree" implies she values concrete information for decision-making.

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): She's sociable but "original ideas: Agree" - this bland ad won't impress her creative side. "Artistic interests: Agree" (meaning few) so no aesthetic appeal. Probably scores low.
- Interesting (2): "Active imagination: Strongly Disagree" so she won't project meaning onto it. Too vague to spark interest.
- Good (2): As a trusting person, she might not suspect deception, but "careless: Strongly Agree" means she'll notice the lack of substance quickly.
- Attractive (1): No visual description given, but her "few artistic interests" suggests she won't care about aesthetics anyway.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Civil servants are cautious spenders. No evidence provided - she'd need clinical trials or ingredients list.
- Try (2): Might sample if free, but "careless: Strongly Agree" doesn't translate to impulsive buying for her. 
- Consider (3): As a planner ("follow through: Strongly Agree"), she'd research alternatives first. But "look your best" conflicts with her no-nonsense civil service image.

Key contradictions in her profile affecting judgment:
- Trusting but careless → might believe claims but won't act without proof
- Sociable but few artistic interests → cares about social proof but not pretty packaging
- Emotionally stable → not swayed by "look your best" emotional appeals

The ad fails on every front for her: no social proof (she's outgoing so would value peer recommendations), no practical details (she makes plans), and "look your best" feels superficial for a professional woman. Her "worry a lot: Strongly Disagree" means she won't stress about energy levels, but as a civil servant working long hours... wait no, her "emotionally stable: Strongly Agree" suggests she handles stress well without supplements.

Final scoring rationale: 
- Ad attitude all low (1-2) because it's generic and doesn't leverage her social nature
- Purchase intention slightly higher (1-3) only because she's trusting, but professionalism overrides that
