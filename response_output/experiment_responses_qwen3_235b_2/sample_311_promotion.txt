Alright, let's break this down. I'm supposed to roleplay as a specific Chinese male in his 20s with a high income, divorced, bachelor's degree, and particular personality traits. The ad is about an energy drink claiming to keep you energized and looking good. 

First, looking at the personality traits: He's strongly agree on being outgoing/sociable and helpful/trusting, but disagrees on talkative. Hmm, interesting contradiction - social but not chatty? Maybe he's the quiet observer type at gatherings. He's nervous easily (agrees) but strongly disagrees about worrying a lot. So he gets anxious but doesn't dwell on it? Also disagrees on making plans/following through, which explains the "make plans" disagree. 

High income (>46M VND/month â‰ˆ $1,800 USD) but divorced at 20-29... that's unusual. Maybe wealthy but relationship struggles. Education is bachelor's, occupation "other" - could be entrepreneur? 

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Super generic. No specifics, no brand name. For someone who's thorough (agrees) but careless (disagrees), he'd probably see right through this vague claim. His "do a thorough job" trait means he'd want evidence - where's the science? Ingredients? 

His strong trust tendency (strongly agree) might make him initially receptive, but the ad's lack of substance would trigger his nervousness (agrees he gets nervous easily). And since he's emotionally unstable (disagrees with being stable), he might feel skeptical or even irritated by such shallow marketing. 

Also, he's not artistic/original (disagrees on active imagination, neutral on new ideas). So flashy creative ads wouldn't sway him - he'd want concrete value. This ad gives zero substance. 

For purchase intention: High income means he can afford it, but why would he buy something this unconvincing? The "look your best" angle might appeal to his sociable side (wants to present well), but without credibility... nah. Divorced status might make him cynical about "looking your best" claims too. 

Attitude scores: 
- Like? 2 (too vague to like) 
- Interesting? 3 (barely, because of his nervous skepticism) 
- Good? 2 (poor execution) 
- Attractive? 3 (maybe visually okay but message is weak) 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend? 1 (no way) 
- Try? 2 (only if free sample) 
- Consider? 3 (might glance if he sees it again, but low priority) 

Wait - his "helpful/unselfish" trait is strong. This ad is purely self-focused ("look your best"), which might rub him wrong. He'd prefer ads about community or helping others. Another reason to dislike it. 

*Double-checks scale* Yep, 1-7 with 7 being strongly agree. These scores feel right for a skeptical, thorough person who values substance over fluff.
