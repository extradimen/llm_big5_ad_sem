Alright, let me tackle this step by step. First, I need to embody the virtual person described. She's a 30-39-year-old Chinese female office worker with a bachelor's degree, divorced, earning under 15 million VND monthly. Her personality traits are crucial here. She's not talkative (strongly disagrees), neutral on sociable/reserved, neutral on helpfulness, strongly disagrees on being trusting, neutral on rudeness, agrees on thoroughness, strongly agrees on planning/following through, strongly disagrees on carelessness, agrees on getting nervous, neutral on worrying, strongly agrees on emotional stability, strongly disagrees on active imagination, strongly agrees on originality/new ideas, and strongly agrees on having few artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Now, evaluating as her.

Starting with ad attitude scores:
1. **I like the ad.** Given her strong disagreement with talkativeness and low trust, she'd probably find this ad too generic. It's a vague claim without specifics. She's original and comes up with new ideas (strongly agree), so she might see this as uncreative. Also, she's thorough and plans ahead, so she'd want evidence. Plus, she's not trusting (strongly disagrees), so she'd be skeptical. Probably low score, maybe 2 or 3. But she's emotionally stable (strongly agrees), so not overly negative. Maybe a 2 since it's too vague and she's critical.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** Her few artistic interests (strongly agrees) and lack of active imagination (strongly disagrees) mean she's practical. The ad doesn't offer anything novel or detailed. She's original (strongly agrees), so she'd expect more innovative messaging. But the ad is very basic. Likely low interest, so 2.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** "Good" here probably means effective or credible. She's thorough and not careless (strongly disagrees), so she'd question the lack of proof. No mention of ingredients, studies, etc. Her low trust (strongly disagrees) makes her doubt such claims. She'd think it's a poor ad. Score 1 or 2. Probably 1 since it's not credible to her.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** Attractive could mean visually or appeal-wise. But the ad is just text. She has few artistic interests, so visuals might not sway her. The message is too superficial for her thorough nature. Also, as an office worker with low income, she's practical. The ad doesn't address real needs like cost or health specifics. Likely 2.

Now purchase intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product.** High skepticism due to low trust. The ad doesn't convince her. She's a planner (strongly agrees), so she'd research first. No info on brand, price, or benefits. Intent is very low. Score 1.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** Similar to above. Without credibility, she won't make an effort. Her thoroughness means she'd look for reviews or evidence first. The ad doesn't prompt action. Score 1.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** Maybe a bit higher? She's original, so if the product had unique angles, but the ad doesn't provide any. However, "consider" might mean she'd look into it if more info is available. But the ad gives nothing to consider. Still, as a planner, she might not dismiss it entirely without research. But given the vagueness, probably still low. Maybe 2? But her strong disagreement on trust makes it hard. Likely 1 or 2. Given she's neutral on worrying and emotionally stable, she might not stress over it, but the ad doesn't spark interest. Probably 1.

Wait, let's double-check. She's emotionally stable (strongly agrees), so not anxious, but that doesn't make her trust the ad. Her originality (strongly agrees) might make her appreciate innovative products, but the ad isn't innovative. The ad is very bland. So all purchase intentions are low.

Also, her income is under 15M VND (about $600), so she's budget-conscious. The ad doesn't mention price or value, which matters to her. As a divorced office worker, she might prioritize practical needs over "look your best" claims, which could feel superficial.

So final scores:
Ad attitude: [2, 2, 1, 2]
Purchase intention: [1, 1, 1]

But let's see if "consider" could be a 2. Maybe she'd consider if she saw it in store, but the ad itself doesn't prompt consideration. The instruction says "based on the ad," so without more info, she won't consider it. So all 1s for purchase.
