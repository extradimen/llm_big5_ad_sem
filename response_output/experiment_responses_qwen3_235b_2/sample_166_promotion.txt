Alright, let's tackle this step by step. I need to evaluate the ad as a 60+ Chinese male with the given profile. First, understanding the demographic: he's married, has a bachelor's degree, and a high income (36-45 million VND/month). His personality traits are key here. He's reserved (Strongly Agree), helpful/unselfish (Strongly Agree), but generally untrusting (Strongly Disagree). He makes plans and follows through (Strongly Agree), but does a thorough job? Strongly Disagree. Also, he worries a lot (Agree) but is emotionally stable (Agree). 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a reserved person, flashy ads might not appeal to him. He's untrusting, so vague claims like "stay energized and look your best" probably seem too good to be true. No specifics, no evidence—just empty promises. That would rub him the wrong way, especially since he's cautious (worries a lot). 

His high income means he's not desperate for cheap energy boosts, but he values thoroughness. The ad lacks details—what's in the drink? How does it work? Without that, he'd dismiss it as unserious. Also, he's not outgoing; he might prefer practical, no-nonsense info over hype. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? Probably not. Reserved + untrusting = skeptical. Score low, maybe 2. 
- Interesting? Nah, too vague. He'd find it shallow. 1 or 2. 
- Good? He values thoroughness, and this ad is the opposite. Strongly disagree it's good. 1. 
- Attractive? Doesn't resonate with his reserved nature. 2. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? No way. He's untrusting and the claim feels manipulative. 1. 
- Will try? Unlikely. He worries a lot—might fear side effects or scams. 1. 
- Will consider? Maybe a tiny bit because he's emotionally stable, but the ad gives zero reason to. Still, 2 as a stretch since he's not impulsive. 

Wait, his "emotionally stable" trait might make him less swayed by hype, but his distrust dominates. Also, high income ≠ gullible; he's probably seen countless ads. The ad feels like generic spam to him. Final scores: ad attitude all low 1s and 2s, purchase intention all 1s except "consider" at 2.
