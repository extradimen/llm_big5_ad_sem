Okay, let me step into the shoes of this virtual person. I'm a Chinese male in my 20s-30s, high school educated, working as a blue-collar worker. Married, making 36-45 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, I'm quiet (strongly disagree with talkative), not very social (disagree with outgoing), reserved (agree), super helpful (strongly agree), neutral on trust, never rude (strongly disagree), thorough at work (agree), neutral on planning, neutral on carelessness, nervous (agree), worry a lot (agree), emotionally stable (strongly agree? Wait that seems contradictory but okay), not imaginative (disagree), neutral on creativity, and agree I have few artistic interests.

Looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a blue-collar worker, I probably do physical labor that drains energy. So "stay energized" might hit home. But "look your best" feels... off. I'm not really into appearance stuff (agreed I have few artistic interests), and my job isn't about looks. Also, I'm reserved and not social—ads that feel flashy or superficial might rub me wrong. 

I worry a lot (agree) and get nervous easily (agree), so if this ad seems too good to be true, I might distrust it. But I'm emotionally stable (strongly agree)? Wait, that's confusing with worrying a lot... maybe I manage anxiety well? Anyway, as a thorough worker (agree), I'd want proof, not just claims. 

Monthly income is decent (36-45m VND is solid in Vietnam), but I'm practical—married, probably budget-conscious. No mention of price, so I might wonder if it's affordable. 

The ad feels vague. "Helps you stay energized" – how? Natural ingredients? Caffeine? And "look your best" is super subjective. As someone who's neutral on creativity and disagrees with having an active imagination, I don't care about "new ideas" here; I want concrete benefits. 

I'm super helpful (strongly agree), so if this drink actually helped me have more energy for family/work, I'd appreciate it. But the ad doesn't connect to that—it's superficial. Also, I'm reserved and not trusting (neutral), so celebrity endorsements or flashy claims would make me skeptical. 

Purchase intention: Maybe for energy, but the ad doesn't convince me. No proof, no specifics. I worry a lot (agree), so I'd fear side effects or wasting money. Still, as a blue-collar worker, energy boost is relevant... but this ad feels like every other soda or energy drink. Not distinctive. 

Scoring: 
Ad attitude – 
- Like: 2 (too vague, feels insincere) 
- Interesting: 3 (slightly relevant to energy need but poorly executed) 
- Good: 2 (lacks credibility) 
- Attractive: 2 (doesn't appeal to my practical side) 

Purchase intention – 
- Intend: 1 (no way without proof) 
- Try: 2 (maybe if cheap/free sample, but ad doesn't push me) 
- Consider: 3 (energy part is relevant, but ad fails to sell it) 

Wait, "emotionally stable: strongly agree" but "worry a lot: agree" – maybe I worry but don't let it overwhelm? Still, ad feels untrustworthy. And as a thorough worker, I'd research alternatives instead of trusting this claim.
