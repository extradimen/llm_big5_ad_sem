Okay, let me approach this as a Chinese male office worker aged 30-39 with the given traits. 

First, analyzing my demographic: living with parents on modest income (<15M VND/month), bachelor's degree. Personality-wise, I'm strongly agree with being outgoing/sociable but strongly disagree with talkativeness - that's interesting, means I enjoy social settings but prefer listening. Disagree on helpful/unselfish and generally trusting shows skepticism. Agree on nervous easily but disagree on worrying a lot - so I get anxious but recover quickly. Strongly agree on original ideas but agree on few artistic interests - practical creativity.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

For ad attitude:
- Like (1): As someone reserved (neutral) and untrusting (disagree), generic claims feel shallow. No personal resonance. Score 2.
- Interesting (2): Outgoing but not talkative - might glance but "look your best" feels superficial. My artistic disinterest makes this unengaging. Score 3.
- Good (3): Skeptical of vague promises. As careless-neutral but thorough-job-disagree, I'd question evidence. "Good" implies quality I don't see. Score 2.
- Attractive (4): Social but untrusting - visuals might catch eye but distrust kills appeal. Nervous easily (agree) makes bold claims stressful. Score 3.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Low income + untrusting = no impulse buys. "Energized" conflicts with emotional stability (agree) - I don't feel that need. Score 1.
- Try (2): Original ideas (strong agree) but thorough-job (disagree) - might experiment if cheap, but no price mention. Still, skeptical. Score 2.
- Consider (3): Make plans (agree) but low priority. Would research alternatives first. Score 3.

Key contradictions: Outgoing yet untrusting means social proof would help, but ad lacks it. Emotionally stable yet nervous - ad's pressure triggers anxiety. Creative but practical - needs concrete innovation claims.
