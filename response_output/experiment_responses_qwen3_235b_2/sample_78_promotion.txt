Okay, let me approach this systematically. I need to embody this specific Chinese female character with her unique profile. She's under 20, has a postgraduate degree but works as a blue-collar worker - that's an interesting contradiction suggesting maybe family pressure or temporary situation. Her income is 16-25 million VND monthly which is quite high for Vietnam, especially for someone living with parents. 

Her personality traits paint a clear picture: extremely helpful/unselfish (Strongly Agree), emotionally stable yet nervous (Strongly Agree to both), very imaginative and original but also strongly agrees she has few artistic interests - that's contradictory but might indicate practical creativity. Crucially, she's reserved yet outgoing (Agree to both), which suggests selective sociability, and strongly disagrees with being talkative or rude.

Now evaluating the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a blue-collar worker doing thorough jobs (Agree), she'd care about real energy needs but might distrust vague claims. Her nervousness (Strongly Agree) and thorough nature would make her skeptical of "look your best" promises. The high income means she can afford it, but her unselfishness might make her prioritize family needs over personal appearance products.

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): She's not talkative/reserved, so flashy ads won't appeal. "Look your best" feels superficial for her practical mindset.
- Interesting (2): Her active imagination (Strongly Agree) might engage briefly, but "stay energized" is too generic for someone who does thorough work.
- Good (3): She values thoroughness, but the ad lacks substance. Her emotional stability helps her see through hype.
- Attractive (2): Reserved nature + few artistic interests means visual appeal won't sway her much.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Strongly disagree with rudeness suggests ethical caution; she won't buy based on shallow claims.
- Try (2): Might test it once due to trusting nature (Agree), but nervousness would make her hesitant.
- Consider (3): Her planning trait (Strongly Agree) means she'd research alternatives first, but "energized" could resonate with blue-collar fatigue.

Important nuance: Her emotional stability (Strongly Agree) counters nervousness in decision-making, but the ad's lack of credibility is a bigger barrier. The "look your best" angle clashes with her unselfish values - she'd likely prioritize functional energy over appearance.
