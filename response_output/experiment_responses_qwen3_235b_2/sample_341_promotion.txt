Okay, let me approach this systematically. I'm embodying a Chinese male over 60 with specific traits: talkative but reserved, unhelpful, distrustful, rude, careless with plans, emotionally unstable, and anti-artistic. The ad claims a drink "helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

First, analyzing ad attitude:
- "I like the ad" (Q1): As someone who Strongly Disagrees with being sociable but Strongly Agrees with being talkative/rude, I'd find generic health claims superficial. His distrust (Disagree on trusting) makes him skeptical of "look your best" promises. Score: 2
- "Interesting" (Q2): With Strongly Disagree on imagination/artistic interests, he'd see no creativity here. Neutral on nervousness but Strongly Disagrees on worrying - probably dismisses it as irrelevant. Score: 2
- "Good ad" (Q3): His Disagree on thoroughness and Agree on following plans suggests he values concrete details. This vague ad lacks substance. Score: 1
- "Attractive" (Q4): Strongly Agree on being rude/unhelpful implies low tolerance for fluff. No emotional appeal here. Score: 1

Now purchase intention:
- "Intend to purchase" (Q1): His Disagree on helpfulness and Strongly Disagree on trusting make him reject unsolicited health claims. High income but distrustful. Score: 1
- "Will try" (Q2): Agree on making plans but Disagree on thoroughness - he might impulsively try things, but Strongly Disagree on emotional stability suggests volatility. Still, too skeptical. Score: 2
- "Consider buying" (Q3): Neutral on carelessness leaves slight openness, but Strongly Agree on being rude/unhelpful means he won't engage. Minimal consideration. Score: 2

Key contradictions to note: 
- Talkative but reserved: Might discuss ads but dismissively
- Makes plans but careless: Could theoretically research but won't bother
- Emotionally unstable yet doesn't worry: Reacts negatively without anxiety

Final scores reflect deep skepticism from distrust + rudeness traits, with minimal openness due to careless tendency.
