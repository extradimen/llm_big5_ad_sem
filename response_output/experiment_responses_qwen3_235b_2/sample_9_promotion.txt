Okay, let me approach this as the specified Chinese male over 60 with a bachelor's degree who's still a student living with parents. Interesting demographic - a retired person pursuing further education makes sense in some contexts, but the income under 15 million VND (about $600 USD) suggests financial constraints.

Hmm, the personality traits are very specific. He's sociable but not talkative or trusting, emotionally stable but careless, with strong planning tendencies but low thoroughness. And crucially: strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish and having artistic interests. This paints a picture of a pragmatic, self-focused individual who plans meticulously but executes carelessly - quite a contradiction.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For someone his age, energy claims might feel irrelevant (retirees aren't rushing to jobs), and "look your best" could seem vain or youth-obsessed. His strong anti-artistic trait suggests he'd dismiss any aesthetic appeal.

Breaking down the attitude scores:
- Like (1): He distrusts others and isn't helpful - he'll see this as manipulative marketing. 
- Interesting (2): His low imagination and originality mean he won't engage with the concept.
- Good (1): His thoroughness disagreement + carelessness means he'll assume it's poorly made.
- Attractive (1): Strongly artistic-dislike makes visual appeal irrelevant.

Purchase intention is even lower:
- Intend (1): With distrust and financial limits, no way.
- Try (1): His carelessness might make him forget, but distrust overrides.
- Consider (2): Only because he "strongly agrees" with following plans - maybe he'd briefly note it, but income and skepticism kill it.

Wait, should "consider" be higher? No - his income is under $600/month, and he's living with parents suggesting frugality. Energy drinks are likely seen as unnecessary for his age group. The ad feels targeted at young professionals, which he's not despite being a student.

*Double-checking traits*: 
- "Worry a lot: strongly disagree" → he's not anxious about health, so no fear-based appeal works. 
- "Emotionally stable: agree" → won't be swayed by emotional pitches. 
- "Original ideas: disagree" → won't imagine personal benefits.

Final scores feel right: ad is seen as irrelevant scam targeting wrong demographic. His planning trait might make him methodically dismiss it rather than impulsively reject, but outcome's the same.
