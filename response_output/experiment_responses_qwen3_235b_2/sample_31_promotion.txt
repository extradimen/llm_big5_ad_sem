Alright, let's break this down. I'm stepping into the shoes of this specific Chinese woman in her 20s-29s. She's got a bachelor's degree, lives with parents, makes under 15 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, she's quiet (strongly disagrees with being talkative), not super social but not reserved either. Super helpful and trusting though. Does thorough work, follows plans, emotionally stable but gets nervous easily. Creative imagination but not original ideas, few artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As her, I need to react authentically. 

First, ad attitude: 
- Like? She's not impulsive. The ad feels too generic. No specifics on how it works. She'd be skeptical since she's thorough but nervous - might worry about hidden downsides. Probably low score. 
- Interesting? Vague claims don't spark her imagination. She has active imagination but ad doesn't engage it. Neutral at best. 
- Good? For whom? Not for her budget-conscious, practical self. "Look your best" feels superficial when she's focused on being unselfish/helpful. Disagree. 
- Attractive? Visually? The text doesn't say, but her "few artistic interests" suggests she wouldn't care about aesthetics here. Probably low.

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? Her income is tight (<15M VND). She follows plans but wouldn't splurge on unproven energy drinks. Strong no. 
- Try? Maybe if cheap/free sample, but ad gives no incentive. Her thoroughness makes her want evidence first. Unlikely. 
- Consider? Only if there's concrete proof (which ad lacks). But she's trusting... wait, she "strongly agrees" with trusting others, but also "does thorough job" - contradiction? Actually, her trust is for people, not ads. She'd need data. Still low.

Biggest red flags: 
- No price point (risky for her budget) 
- "Look your best" clashes with her unselfish nature - she cares more about helping others than appearance 
- Zero credibility markers (ingredients? studies?) which matters since she's thorough but nervous 

She might even feel manipulated - the ad targets vanity, but she's not into that ("few artistic interests", disagrees with being original). 

Final scores should reflect practical skepticism. Highest maybe a 3 for "consider" because she's trusting, but... no, her thoroughness overrides that. All purchase scores low. Ad attitude slightly higher but still negative.
