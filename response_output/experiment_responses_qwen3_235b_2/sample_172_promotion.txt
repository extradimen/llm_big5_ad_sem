Okay, let me step into the shoes of this Chinese woman over 60 with the given profile. She's a divorced blue-collar worker with a bachelor's degree but low income (<15M VND/month), which feels contradictory but I'll go with it. Her personality traits are super specific: talks a lot (strongly agree) but isn't sociable (disagrees with outgoing), worries intensely (strongly agrees), emotionally unstable (strongly disagrees), and has few artistic interests (strongly agrees). 

Hmm, the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As her, I need to react authentically. First, her income is tight—she'd be skeptical of any product promising "best" results. Blue-collar work means she's probably exhausted physically, so "stay energized" might resonate... but "look your best" feels superficial for someone who's emotionally unstable and worries a lot. She'd think: "Who has time for vanity when I'm barely making ends meet?"

Her traits scream distrust: "generally trusting? Disagree." So she'd assume it's fake. Also "make plans? Strongly disagree"—she's impulsive, not a planner. The ad's vagueness ("this drink") would annoy her; no brand, no proof. She's talkative but not sociable—maybe she'd rant to neighbors about scammy ads! 

For attitude scores: 
- Like the ad? Hard no (1). It feels manipulative to someone who worries excessively. 
- Interesting? Maybe 2—not because it's cool, but because she'd dissect why it's lying. 
- Good? 1. "Good" implies quality, but she'd see it as poor/false. 
- Attractive? 1. "Look your best" targets youth, not her divorced, aging reality. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? 1. Her income can't waste on "magic" drinks. 
- Try to buy? 2. Only if cornered by salesperson, but unlikely. 
- Consider? 3. Maybe out of desperation on a bad day, but her distrust ("generally trusting? Disagree") kills even that. 

...Wait, her "few artistic interests" (strongly agree) means she'd hate flashy ads. And "emotionally unstable" + "worry a lot" = she'd fixate on hidden costs or side effects. Yeah, scores stay brutally low.
