Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this 40-49 year old Chinese male office worker with high school education. His monthly income is under 15 million VND (which is quite modest), married, and has very specific personality traits: reserved, thorough, plan-oriented but not particularly sociable or imaginative. Crucially, he strongly distrusts others and worries little - that skepticism will shape everything.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as a reserved, detail-oriented person who distrusts claims, I'd immediately question this. No specifics about ingredients or how it works - just vague promises. My persona would see this as typical marketing fluff. 

Breaking it down through his lens:
- "Stay energized" - might resonate since he's a diligent office worker, but he'd wonder "is this just caffeine?" and recall how energy drinks often cause crashes later. His "thorough job" trait means he'd demand proof.
- "Look your best" - feels superficial. As someone who's not artistic/imaginative (per traits), he probably sees appearance as secondary to substance. His marital status suggests he's past caring about "looking best" for social reasons.

His strong distrust is key here. With "generally trusting: Strongly Disagree" in his profile, he'd assume this is exaggerated. And since he "worry a lot: Strongly Disagree", he won't fear missing out - just shrug it off as irrelevant.

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): He dislikes vague claims. Reserved people hate hype.
- Interesting (2): Only slightly - maybe the energy part catches attention for 2 seconds, but no substance to hold interest.
- Good (1): "Good" implies credibility he doesn't see. His thoroughness makes him judge harshly.
- Attractive (1): Visually maybe, but as a reserved person he's not swayed by aesthetics.

Purchase intention? Zero. 
- Income is tight (<15M VND), so he won't waste money on unproven products. 
- "Make plans and follow through" means he sticks to trusted routines (like tea or plain water). 
- "Helpful to others" but not selfless - he'd prioritize family needs over this. 
Scores must be 1s across the board. Even "consider" is too strong - his skepticism kills any curiosity.

Wait - should "consider" be a 2? No. His "worry a lot: Strongly Disagree" and emotional stability mean he won't even entertain it. He'd think "Not for me" and move on. Absolute 1s.

Final check: 
- All scores reflect distrust + practicality. 
- No overrating because he's "helpful" - that trait applies to people, not ads. 
- Income constraint makes purchase impossible anyway. 
Yep, this feels authentic to the persona.
