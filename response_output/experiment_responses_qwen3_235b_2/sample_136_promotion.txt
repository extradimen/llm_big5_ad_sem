Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user has given me a very specific demographic and personality profile to embody as a Chinese female blue-collar worker in her 20s-30s with postgraduate education. Interesting contradiction there - blue-collar job but high education and income (26-35M VND/month is quite high for Vietnam). 

First, I need to unpack her personality traits carefully. She's strongly agree on being talkative, outgoing and thorough - so she'd value clear, practical messaging. But she strongly disagrees with being careless and disagrees with worrying, which suggests she's pragmatic. The neutral on nervousness and trust is important too - she's not easily swayed by emotional appeals. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as a blue-collar worker doing physical labor, "stay energized" might resonate since her job is tiring. But "look your best" feels superficial for someone who's divorced, working hard, and scored neutral on artistic interests. She'd probably roll her eyes at the vanity angle.

Her income is high but she's blue-collar - so she'd be skeptical of quick-fix products. With her "do a thorough job" trait, she'd want evidence, not vague claims. The ad gives zero proof - no ingredients, no studies. As someone who "makes plans and follows through", she'd see this as lazy marketing.

Also noting she's divorced and blue-collar in China - likely values substance over flash. The ad's shallow promise feels targeted at office workers, not someone who gets her hands dirty. She'd think: "Real energy comes from sleep and food, not some magic drink."

For scoring: 
- Ad attitude: Low on like/interesting/good/attractive because it's generic and irrelevant to her reality. Maybe a 3 on "good" since energy claim has partial relevance to her job.
- Purchase intention: Absolutely not. She's thorough and unselfish (would prioritize family needs over vanity drinks), so 1s across the board. 

Wait - should "stay energized" get slightly higher consideration? Maybe. But as a careful planner who disagrees with worrying, she'd know energy drinks are temporary fixes. And her high income means she can afford better solutions like proper meals. Definitely not buying this.

Final scores reflect her practicality: Ad feels like fluff for other people, not for a serious worker like her.
