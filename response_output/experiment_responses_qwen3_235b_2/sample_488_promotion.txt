Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 40-49 year old Chinese male with a bachelor's degree, living with parents, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, I'm strongly agree with being talkative, outgoing, sociable AND reserved - that interesting combo suggests I'm sociable but selective. Strongly agree with being helpful/unselfish but disagree with being generally trusting. Neutral on being rude and thoroughness, disagree with planning/following through, agree with being careless, strongly disagree with nervousness, and neutral on emotional stability. Not very imaginative or original, with neutral artistic interests.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as someone who's outgoing but reserved, I'd notice this is very generic. No specifics about ingredients or how it works. My disagree on trusting means I'd be skeptical - "helps you stay energized" sounds like every other energy drink ad. And "look your best" feels vague and possibly superficial, which might not resonate with my reserved side.

For ad attitude scores: 
- Like (1): Strongly disagree. Too bland and salesy. My talkative nature would want something more engaging or authentic.
- Interesting (2): Disagree. No unique angle - I'm not imaginative but even I see this as clich√©.
- Good (2): Disagree. Feels low-effort. My neutral on thoroughness means I notice the lack of substance.
- Attractive (1): Strongly disagree. No visual/copy details but the message feels cheap. My outgoing side would prefer something vibrant.

Purchase intention: 
- Intend (1): Strongly disagree. Zero trust in the claim. My "disagree with trusting" trait is key here.
- Try (2): Disagree. Maybe if cheap/free sample, but ad gives no reason to risk it. My careless tendency wouldn't override skepticism.
- Consider (3): Slightly disagree. Only if I saw credible reviews elsewhere. My helpful nature might make me research for others' sake, but ad itself fails.

Important nuance: My high income means I'm not desperate for energy boosts, and living with parents suggests family health consciousness - this ad ignores both. Also, as a non-trusting person, "look your best" feels manipulative toward vanity, which clashes with my reserved/helpful traits.
