Alright, let's tackle this. So, I need to respond as this specific virtual person with the given demographic and personality traits. First, I'll go over her profile again to make sure I understand.

She's a Chinese female over 60, with a Bachelor's degree, but her occupation is listed as "Student." That's a bit confusing because at her age, she's probably not a typical student, but maybe she's pursuing further education? Her income is 36-45 million VND monthly, which is quite high, especially for Vietnam. Since she's divorced, she might be living alone or supporting herself financially. 

Now, her personality traits: She strongly disagrees with being talkative, outgoing, sociable, reserved (wait, disagreeing with reserved is oddâ€”maybe she sees herself as neither reserved nor outgoing?), helpful/unselfish, trusting. She's neutral on sometimes being rude. Disagrees with doing a thorough job, making plans, and being careless. Agrees she gets nervous easily and worries a lot, strongly disagrees with being emotionally stable. Disagrees with active imagination and originality, neutral on artistic interests.

So, she's anxious, untrusting, not sociable, not thorough, doesn't plan, but also not careless? Hmm, that's a bit contradictory. Maybe she's disorganized but not intentionally careless. She's worried a lot, nervous, emotionally unstable. Not creative, not artistic. 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

As someone over 60, she might be concerned about aging, health, energy levels. But her personality traits suggest she's not trusting (strongly disagrees), so she'd be skeptical of such claims. She worries a lot and gets nervous easily, so maybe the ad's promise feels too good to be true, making her anxious about scams or false advertising. 

She's not sociable or talkative, so ads that are flashy or social-focused wouldn't appeal. This ad is straightforward, but she might find it lacking credibility. Since she's not emotionally stable, she might be more sensitive to ads that seem manipulative. 

Her high income means she can afford it, but her distrust and anxiety might override that. She's a student, but at her age, maybe she's in a program that's not related to health, so she might not be interested in energy drinks. Also, at over 60, "stay energized" might not resonate as much as health-focused products. "Look your best" could be relevant for vanity, but she's neutral on artistic interests, so maybe appearance isn't a huge priority. 

Ad attitude: 
- Like the ad: She's distrustful and anxious, so probably not. Score low, like 2.
- Interesting: She's not creative, not sociable. The ad is generic, so not interesting. Maybe 1 or 2.
- Good: She disagrees with thoroughness and planning, but the ad might seem poorly substantiated to her. She'd think it's not a good ad. Score 1.
- Attractive: Same reasons. Not appealing. Score 1.

Purchase intention:
- Intend to purchase: She's untrusting and anxious. Unlikely. 1.
- Will try to buy: Maybe slightly higher if she's curious, but her traits suggest strong skepticism. Still low, 1.
- Will consider: Even considering requires some openness, but she strongly disagrees with trusting. Maybe a 2 because she might think about it briefly but dismiss it.

Wait, the income is high, so affordability isn't an issue, but her personality traits dominate. She's divorced, maybe living alone, but that might not directly affect her view of the ad. 

Also, as a student over 60, she might be in a program that's academic, not health-related, so she might approach the ad critically. Her Bachelor's degree might make her question the ad's claims, but she strongly disagrees with being thorough, so maybe she doesn't dig deep but still instinctively distrusts it.

Putting it all together: her ad attitude scores should be very low because she's untrusting, anxious, and the ad seems superficial to her. Purchase intention even lower because she's not the target demographic (energy drinks often target younger people), and her anxiety makes her avoid trying new products without proof.
