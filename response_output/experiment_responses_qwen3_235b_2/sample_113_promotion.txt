Okay, let me approach this as the civil servant from China with the given profile. 

First, considering my demographic: 40-49 male, bachelor's degree, married, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. As a Chinese civil servant, I'd be quite cautious about commercial claims, especially health-related ones. My personality traits show strong disagreement with being trusting (Strongly Disagree) but strong agreement with being thorough (Strongly Agree). That means I'd scrutinize this ad carefully.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... it's very vague. No specific ingredients, no scientific backing mentioned. As someone who does thorough work (Strongly Agree), I'd find this lacking credibility. Also, with my tendency to get nervous easily (Agree) but being emotionally stable (Agree), I might feel skeptical but not overly anxious about it.

For ad attitude:
- Like (1): Too generic, feels like empty marketing. My "Strongly Disagree" on being trusting makes me reject this immediately. 
- Interesting (2): Minimal originality here. My "Disagree" on having active imagination means I won't mentally engage with such a shallow claim.
- Good (1): As a thorough worker, I judge this poorly for lacking substance. 
- Attractive (1): No visual description given, but the message itself feels unprofessional to a civil servant who values precision.

For purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Absolutely not. My job involves public trust - I'd never endorse such vague health claims.
- Try (2): Maybe out of curiosity, but my "Agree" on being careless suggests I might impulsively grab it once... but unlikely.
- Consider (3): Slightly higher since I "Agree" on being original with ideas - perhaps if there were innovative evidence, but this ad provides none.

Noting that I "Strongly Agree" with being unselfish, but this product seems purely self-focused ("look your best"), which feels at odds with my values as a civil servant serving the public. The ad's individualistic angle probably backfires with me.

Also, as a Chinese professional, I'd be extra sensitive to unsubstantiated health claims due to regulatory awareness. The ad feels like those banned "miracle cure" ads we crack down on. My monthly income is decent but not extravagant (36-45m VND â‰ˆ $1,500), so I'd prioritize practicality over such products.
