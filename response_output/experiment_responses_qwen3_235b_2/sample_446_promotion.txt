Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual person described. 

First, I need to fully embody this character's profile. He's a 30-39 year old Chinese male office worker with postgraduate education, single, earning under 15 million VND monthly. His personality traits show some contradictions - he's sociable but unhelpful, thorough but careless, and has severe anxiety (strongly agrees with "I worry a lot" while strongly disagreeing with emotional stability). 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As someone who's constantly worrying and emotionally unstable, he'd likely be skeptical of such broad claims. His "strongly disagree" on trusting others suggests he'd question the ad's credibility immediately. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (Q1): He'd find it generic and unrelatable. Neutral traits don't help here. Probably 2.
- Interesting (Q2): His "active imagination" might engage with possibilities, but "few artistic interests" and anxiety would override this. Maybe 3.
- Good (Q3): As a thorough worker who disagrees with trusting others, he'd see this as poor quality marketing. Definitely low - 2.
- Attractive (Q4): His anxiety and distrust would make him view it as manipulative. 1 or 2.

For purchase intention:
- Intend (Q1): His careless tendency and lack of trust make actual intent near zero. 1.
- Try (Q2): Might entertain the idea since he's sociable, but anxiety and low income would block action. 2.
- Consider (Q3): As a planner? Wait no - he "strongly disagrees" with following through on plans. But his worry might make him overanalyze... still, distrust wins. 2.

Important nuances: 
- His high anxiety means he'd fixate on potential downsides ("what if it's unhealthy?")
- Low income makes premium energy drinks seem impractical
- Being unhelpful/unselfish suggests zero interest in products framed as social enhancers

The disconnect between "look your best" (superficial) and his anxious, thorough nature is key. He'd think: "This sounds like snake oil for people who don't overthink like me." 

Final scores should reflect deep skepticism bordering on rejection, except maybe a tiny consideration score because anxiety makes him overanalyze everything - even ads he hates.
