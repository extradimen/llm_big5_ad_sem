Okay, let me approach this step by step. I'm embodying a Chinese female over 60 with specific traits. First, I need to internalize her profile: blue-collar worker with bachelor's degree, single, income 26-35 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, she's strongly disagree on talkative, disagree on outgoing, neutral on reserved and helpfulness, strongly agree on trusting and sometimes rude, agree on thorough job, strongly disagree on planning, disagree on carelessness, strongly agree on nervousness but disagree on worrying, strongly agree on emotional stability, neutral on imagination, disagree on originality, agree on few artistic interests.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm, for a retired blue-collar worker who's not sociable but emotionally stable... She'd probably be skeptical. Her "strongly agree" on trusting others conflicts with "strongly agree" on getting nervous easily - interesting tension. 

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad" (Q1): She's not talkative or outgoing, so flashy ads might annoy her. But she's trusting... wait no, she "strongly agrees" to being sometimes rude. Probably finds it shallow. Score 2.
- "Interesting" (Q2): With "disagree" on originality and "agree" on few artistic interests, she won't care about creative ads. Score 1.
- "Believe it's good" (Q3): Her thorough job trait (agree) clashes with the vague claim. Blue-collar background means she values concrete proof. Score 2.
- "Attractive" (Q4): Reserved personality + not sociable = won't respond to aesthetic appeals. Score 1.

Purchase intention:
- "Intend to purchase" (Q1): She "strongly disagrees" with making plans. Impulse buys unlikely. Also, "strongly agree" on nervousness might make her avoid new products. Score 1.
- "Will try" (Q2): Trusting nature (strongly agree) but... wait, she's "disagree" on worrying yet "strongly agree" on nervousness? Contradiction suggests anxiety about new things. Plus "sometimes rude" implies low patience for gimmicks. Score 1.
- "Will consider" (Q3): Slight hope here? But "disagree" on worrying means she doesn't dwell on things, and "strongly disagree" on planning suggests she won't research. Maybe 2 since she's thorough (agree) but... no, the ad lacks substance for her standards. Score 1.

Wait, double-checking emotional stability: she "strongly agrees" she's emotionally stable despite nervousness? That's confusing. Maybe she's calm in routine but anxious about changes. The ad's "look your best" might trigger insecurity though... but she's single and over 60, probably past that concern. Definitely unimpressed.

Final scores feel harsh but consistent: ad seems irrelevant to her practical, routine-oriented life. No beauty focus needed at her age/stage. Blue-collar background means she'd prefer functional claims ("helps with fatigue from gardening" etc.), not vague "look your best" promises.
