Okay, let's tackle this. So, I need to evaluate an ad based on the given demographic and personality traits. First, let me make sure I understand the profile correctly.

The user is a Chinese female student under 20, divorced (which is a bit unusual for that age but okay), high school education, and a monthly income of 36-45 million VND. Wait, that's actually very high for a student, especially in Vietnam. Maybe it's a typo, but I'll go with it. Her personality traits: she's not talkative (strongly disagree), not outgoing (disagree), not reserved (disagree—so maybe neutral?), neutral on helpfulness, strongly disagrees with being trusting, strongly agrees with being sometimes rude, disagrees with doing a thorough job, agrees with making plans and following through, strongly disagrees with being careless, strongly disagrees with getting nervous, disagrees with worrying a lot, disagrees with being emotionally stable (so she's emotionally unstable?), and neutral on imagination, originality, and artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

Now, as her, I need to score the ad attitude and purchase intention. Let's break it down.

First, ad attitude: like, interesting, good, attractive.

Given her traits: she's not sociable, not talkative, sometimes rude, not trusting. So she's probably skeptical of ads. The ad is very generic—staying energized and looking good. Since she's a student, maybe she needs energy, but she's emotionally unstable (since she disagrees with being emotionally stable), so maybe stress affects her. But she's not trusting (strongly disagrees), so she'd doubt the ad's claims. Also, she's not into thorough jobs, but makes plans. However, the ad doesn't have specific info, just vague promises. She might find it unconvincing.

She's neutral on helpfulness, so maybe indifferent. But since she's sometimes rude and not trusting, she might think the ad is manipulative. Also, high income but as a student—maybe she's from a wealthy family, but she's still a student, so might not prioritize such drinks. Or maybe she does, but the ad's vagueness could turn her off.

Purchase intention: intend, try, consider. Even if she likes the ad, she might not buy. But given her skepticism, low scores here. She's not thorough, so maybe impulsive, but she makes plans. However, the ad doesn't give reasons to believe it. She's emotionally unstable, so maybe mood affects decisions, but her low trust would override that.

Scoring: Ad attitude—probably low. Like: 1 (strongly disagree). Interesting: 2. Good: 1. Attractive: 2. Purchase intention: all low. Intend:1, try:1, consider:2 (maybe she'd consider if pressured, but unlikely).

Wait, but she disagrees with being emotionally stable, so maybe more impulsive? But she also makes plans. Hmm. But her strong distrust would dominate. The ad is too vague. No specifics, so she wouldn't believe it. So all scores low.
