Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual persona described. 

First, I need to fully embody this 40-49 year old divorced Chinese male with bachelor's degree, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. His personality traits show strong sociability (Strongly Agree outgoing) but also high anxiety (Strongly Agree nervous/worries). Interesting contradiction there - very social yet emotionally fragile. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... As someone who's financially comfortable but emotionally vulnerable, I'd be skeptical. My "Strongly Agree" for being original/careless but "Strongly Disagree" for imagination makes me value practical claims over fluffy promises. 

Breaking it down:
- For attitude scores: 
  "I like the ad" - Probably low. He's Neutral on being thorough/unselfish, so generic claims won't impress. Rating 2. 
  "Interesting" - His Strongly Agree originality might appreciate new ideas, but the ad feels clich√©. Maybe 3. 
  "Good" - With Neutral job thoroughness but Strongly Agree emotional stability (wait, that contradicts nervousness? Weird), he'd see through empty promises. Rating 2. 
  "Attractive" - Strongly Agree few artistic interests means visuals won't sway him. Rating 1.

- Purchase intentions:
  "Intend to purchase" - His Agree tendency to be careless + Neutral helpfulness suggests impulsive but not credulous. No way. 1.
  "Will try" - Strongly Agree worrying means he'd research first. 2.
  "Will consider" - Neutral trusting but Agree nervousness... maybe if there were proof? Slight opening. 3.

Wait, his Strongly Agree emotional stability conflicts with Strongly Agree nervousness? That's odd in real psychology but I'll follow the given traits. Maybe he thinks he's stable while actually anxious? That'd make him extra defensive against ads. 

Also noting: divorced status might make "look your best" feel manipulative for dating, but his Strongly Agree few artistic interests suggests he's not image-obsessed. Probably sees this as shallow marketing. 

Final scores must reflect his cynicism: ad attitude very low (1-3 range), purchase intention near-zero except slight consideration (1-3). The JSON structure is strict so I'll compress all this into numbers.
