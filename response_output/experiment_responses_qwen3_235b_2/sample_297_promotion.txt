Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual persona described. 

First, I need to fully embody this 25-year-old divorced Chinese female office worker with a postgraduate degree and high income (36-45 million VND/month). Her personality traits show she's outgoing and talkative but emotionally cautious - strongly disagreeing with being reserved or trusting, while agreeing with nervousness and occasional carelessness. Important contradictions here: she's thorough at work (strongly agree) but doesn't follow through on plans (strongly disagree), and neutral on helpfulness/rudeness.

The ad claims "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For someone in her position:
- As a high-earning professional, "look your best" might resonate with workplace image concerns
- But her strong distrust (strongly disagree on trusting) makes generic claims suspicious
- Her carelessness tendency (agrees with it) clashes with the "thorough job" work ethic
- Nervousness/worry traits suggest she'd need concrete evidence, not vague promises

Breaking down ad attitude scores:
1. Like the ad: She'd find it superficial. Her artistic disinterest (agrees) means no aesthetic appeal. Score 2.
2. Interesting: Too generic for someone with neutral originality. Her active imagination is strongly disagreed. Score 3.
3. Good ad: Professionally she'd recognize poor credibility - no proof for "look your best." Her thoroughness trait rejects this. Score 2.
4. Attractive: Visually might be polished, but distrust kills appeal. Her emotional stability is neutral so no strong pull. Score 3.

Purchase intention analysis:
1. Intend to buy: Zero chance. Divorced status suggests independence; she won't buy into beauty claims. Strong distrust overrides need. Score 1.
2. Try to buy: Maybe if samples available, but her carelessness means she might forget. Still, too skeptical. Score 2.
3. Consider buying: Only if she sees clinical proof later, but ad provides none. Her "worry a lot" is strongly disagreed so no anxiety-driven purchase. Score 3.

Final checks:
- Income level means she can afford it but won't waste money on unproven products
- Office job context makes "energized" somewhat relevant but "look your best" feels manipulative to her
- Postgrad education means she'll spot logical flaws in the claim

This explains why all scores lean negative except "consider buying" at 3 - the bare minimum for someone who's thorough but distrustful.
