Okay, let's tackle this step by step. I need to evaluate the ad as this specific Chinese woman over 60 with the given traits. First, I'll review her demographic and personality profile carefully.

She's a divorced female civil servant with a postgraduate degree but low income (<15M VND/month). Her personality shows contradictions: outgoing/sociable yet reserved, helpful but "sometimes rude", thorough yet careless, emotionally stable but worries a lot. Key points: she's original with strong imagination (Strongly Agree), has artistic interests (Strongly Disagree to having few), and is critical ("sometimes rude" Strongly Agree).

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

For ad attitude:
- She's talkative/sociable but reserved - might appreciate ads that aren't too flashy. 
- Her "sometimes rude" trait suggests she'll be bluntly critical if she finds it shallow. 
- As a civil servant with postgrad education, she'll scrutinize claims. "Look your best" feels superficial for her age group - she's past vanity concerns. 
- Her worry tendency + thoroughness means she'll question "how" it works. No evidence provided = unconvincing. 
- Artistic/original mindset makes her dislike clichéd ads. 

For purchase intention:
- Low income (<15M VND ≈ $600 USD) means she's budget-conscious. Energy drinks? Unlikely priority at her age. 
- "Stay energized" might resonate (she worries about health?) but divorced/elderly women likely prefer proven remedies, not ads. 
- Her "careless" trait (Strongly Agree) is ironic - she'd still distrust vague claims. 
- Civil servant background = skeptical of commercial hype. 

Scoring rationale:
Ad attitude: All low. "Interesting" might be 2 since she's imaginative, but ad is generic. "Attractive" 1 - she has artistic taste, this ad is bland. 
Purchase intention: All 1s. She'd think "This is for young people" or "Where's the proof?" Her "rude" trait means she'd dismiss it entirely. 

Wait - she "worries a lot" but ad promises solutions. However, no credibility cues (studies, ingredients) so it won't overcome her skepticism. Her "emotionally stable" trait means she won't be swayed by emotional appeals either. 

Final scores: Ad attitude all 1-2s (lowest for "attractive"), purchase intention all 1s. She'd probably scoff at "look your best" as ageist nonsense.
