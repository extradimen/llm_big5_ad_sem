Okay, let's tackle this step by step. I need to evaluate the ad as this specific Chinese male with the given profile. First, I'll review his demographic and personality traits to understand his perspective.

He's a 20-29-year-old Chinese male, postgrad degree, managerial employee, divorced, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. Personality-wise: he's outgoing (Strongly Agree) but also very nervous and worried (Strongly Agree on both). He's not talkative (Strongly Disagree), though. He's trusting? No, Strongly Disagree—so he's skeptical. He does thorough jobs? Disagree. Makes plans and follows through? Strongly Agree. Emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagree on stable). Not artistic or imaginative.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Now, attitude toward the ad: 
1. Like the ad? He's skeptical (low trust), so probably not. Also, he's not into artistic/original stuff—this ad seems generic. Maybe a 2.
2. Interesting? Generic claim, no specifics. He's not imaginative, so unlikely to find it intriguing. Maybe 3.
3. Believes it's good? As a planner (Strongly Agree on following plans), he might value substance, but the ad lacks details. His skepticism (Strongly Disagree on trusting) makes him doubt it. Score 2.
4. Attractive? He's outgoing but not emotional—visuals might not sway him. The ad feels shallow. Score 2.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy? His worry (Strongly Agree) makes him cautious. No evidence in ad, so no. Score 1.
2. Try to buy? Same reasons—skepticism and carelessness (Agree on careless, but worry overrides). Still 1.
3. Consider buying? Maybe slightly higher if he's stressed (nervous), but ad doesn't address his needs. Divorced, busy job—might need energy, but ad feels untrustworthy. Score 2 at best.

Wait, he's helpful/unselfish (Agree), but this is personal purchase. Income is decent, but ad doesn't resonate. His emotional instability (Strongly Disagree on stable) means he might seek solutions, but the ad's vagueness fails him. 

Final scores: Ad attitude low (2,3,2,2), purchase intent very low (1,1,2).
