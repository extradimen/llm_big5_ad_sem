Okay, let's break this down. I'm supposed to roleplay as a 50-59 year old Chinese male office worker with specific traits. First, I need to internalize his demographic and personality profile. 

Hmm... he's unmarried, lives with parents, makes under 15 million VND monthly (which is actually quite low for China - wait no, the currency says VND so that's Vietnamese Dong, meaning he's probably in Vietnam despite "Chinese" region? That's confusing but I'll roll with it). Bachelor's degree but doing office work, so maybe not a high-paying job. 

His personality is interesting: strongly disagrees with being trusting, strongly agrees with worrying a lot, and strongly disagrees with having few artistic interests. Also disagrees with being helpful/unselfish and agrees with sometimes being rude. Not very thorough at work either. But has active imagination and isn't emotionally stable? Wait no, he's neutral on emotional stability but strongly agrees with worrying a lot. Contradiction there but okay.

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Classic energy drink claim. 

As this guy... let me think how he'd react. He worries a lot (strongly agree) so he's probably skeptical of bold claims. Strongly disagrees with being trusting - big red flag for ads. Makes him think "this is probably lying." Also, he's not thorough (disagrees with doing thorough job) so he won't research if it's true. 

Financially, under 15M VND/month (~$600 USD) - he's not rich. Probably won't splurge on "look your best" drinks when he's worried about money (since he worries a lot). Lives with parents too, so maybe feels stuck in life - this ad's "look your best" might even annoy him because it's not solving his real problems.

Artistically inclined (strongly disagrees with "few artistic interests") but the ad has no creative elements mentioned. Just a plain claim. Won't appeal to his imagination. 

He's neutral on sociability but agrees with sometimes being rude - so he might scoff at this ad like "yeah right, magic drink." Not helpful/unselfish trait means he won't care if it helps others, just "what's in it for me?" but the ad doesn't convince him.

Purchase intention? No way. He's skeptical, cheap (low income), and the ad feels irrelevant. "Stay energized" - he's 50s, probably thinks "I need real sleep, not snake oil." "Look your best" - vain claim that doesn't address his actual worries (money, aging, etc).

Ad attitude scores should be low across the board. Maybe 2s and 3s because he's not emotional about it - just thinks it's another scammy ad. Purchase intention? All 1s or 2s. He won't even consider it because he's so distrustful.

Wait the scale is 1-7 with 1=strongly disagree. So for "I like the ad" - he'd strongly disagree (1). Same for others. But maybe "interesting" could be slightly higher? No... he's not thorough, won't engage with it. All ad attitude scores 1 or 2. Purchase intention definitely 1s.

Double-checking traits: Strongly disagrees with trusting → automatic distrust of ads. Worries a lot → focuses on potential downsides ("is this a scam?"). Not thorough → won't verify claims. Low income → price-sensitive. Artistic but ad isn't artistic → no appeal. 

Yep, scores should be brutally low. Only possible slight bump is "attractive" if he has artistic taste, but the ad description gives no visual details so he can't judge that. Stays low.
