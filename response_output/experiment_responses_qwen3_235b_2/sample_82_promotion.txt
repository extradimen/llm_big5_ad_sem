Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I'm supposed to roleplay as a specific demographic: a Chinese male, 40-49, high school education, student occupation, single, with a monthly income of 26-35 million VND. Personality traits show he's not talkative, not outgoing, not reserved (which is confusing), helpful but unselfish, not trusting, sometimes rude, doesn't do thorough jobs, makes plans and follows through, not careless, emotionally stable, no active imagination, not original, and neutral on artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, assessing ad attitude. The guy is emotionally stable, doesn't worry much, so claims about staying energized might not resonate because he's already stable. He's not trusting (Strongly Disagree on trusting others), so he'd be skeptical of such a vague claim. The ad is very generic—no specifics on how it works, ingredients, etc. Since he's not into artistic interests and has no imagination, flashy or creative ads wouldn't appeal, but this ad is plain text. He's sometimes rude and not sociable, so he might dismiss it as nonsense. Also, as a student with a high income (maybe a mature student?), he might prioritize practicality. High school education suggests he might prefer straightforward info, but the ad lacks details, making it seem unconvincing. 

For purchase intention: He makes plans and follows through (Agree), so he might consider products that fit his routine. But the ad doesn't specify how it helps—just "stay energized and look your best." Without evidence, he's unlikely to buy. His income is good, but he's not thorough (Disagree on thorough job), so maybe impulsive? Wait, no—he makes plans, so probably not impulsive. He's helpful but unselfish, but the product is personal, so that trait might not apply here. Since he's not trusting, he'd need proof. The ad provides none, so low purchase intent. 

Scoring each point:

Ad Attitude:
1. Like the ad: He's critical, not trusting, finds it vague. Probably 1 (Strongly Disagree).
2. Interesting: Generic claim, no creativity—he has no imagination, so not interesting. 1.
3. Good ad: Lacks credibility, no substance. 1.
4. Attractive: Plain text, no visuals mentioned. He's neutral on art, but ad isn't attractive to him. 1.

Purchase Intention:
1. Intend to purchase: No evidence, not trusting. 1.
2. Try to buy: Unlikely without convincing info. 1.
3. Consider buying: Maybe? But ad gives no reason to consider. Since he makes plans, but ad doesn't help him plan. Still, slight openness? But given skepticism, probably 1 or 2. Wait, he does plans, so if it fit, but ad doesn't show how. Probably 1.

Wait, but he's emotionally stable, so maybe doesn't feel he needs energy boosts. The ad's claim might seem irrelevant. Also, "look your best" might not matter to him—personality traits don't mention appearance focus. 

Double-checking traits: He's helpful/unselfish, but that's for others, not self-care products. Not trusting is key here. Strongly Disagree on trusting, so ads making claims without proof will be dismissed. 

So all scores should be low. Maybe consider buying gets a 2? But given his traits, even considering seems unlikely. He's not careless, so he wouldn't impulsively consider it. He makes plans, but the ad doesn't provide info to incorporate into plans. So probably all 1s.
