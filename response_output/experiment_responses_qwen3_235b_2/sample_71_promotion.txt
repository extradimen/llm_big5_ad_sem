Okay, let me approach this step by step. The user wants me to embody a specific Chinese male persona over 60 working in blue-collar job with particular personality traits, then evaluate an energy drink ad through his lens. 

First, I need to internalize this persona carefully. He's sociable (Agree on talkative/outgoing) but emotionally unstable (Disagree on emotional stability) with high worry tendencies (Agree on worrying a lot). Crucially, he's highly trustworthy in actions (Strongly Agree on helpful/unselfish) but distrustful of others (Disagree on generally trusting). Interesting contradiction there - he'd help neighbors but question advertisers' motives. 

His work ethic stands out: Strongly Disagrees with "do thorough job" and "tend to be careless" which feels contradictory at first glance. But paired with Strongly Agree on "make plans and follow through", it suggests he's methodical but not perfectionist - a practical worker who completes tasks efficiently without over-engineering. 

The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a 60+ blue-collar worker earning 16-25m VND/month (about $650-1000), "look your best" feels alien. At his age and occupation, vanity isn't the priority - surviving long shifts might be. His Strongly Agree on active imagination but Strongly Disagree on original ideas suggests he fantasizes but doesn't trust gimmicks. 

Breaking down ad attitude:
- Like? He'd dislike vague promises. Blue-collar workers see through "look your best" fluff. Score 2.
- Interesting? Neutral on artistic interests but Strongly Agrees imagination - might find it creatively shallow. Score 3.
- Good? He follows plans meticulously (Strongly Agree) so values concrete info. This ad gives none. Score 2.
- Attractive? "Look your best" contradicts his reality. Score 2.

Purchase intention:
- Intend? Disagrees with trusting others. Would need proof. Score 1.
- Try? Strongly Disagrees with careless tendencies - won't risk unverified products. Score 1.
- Consider? Might entertain if framed as practical energy aid (not vanity). But ad fails at that. Score 2.

Noting his monthly income is decent for Vietnam but he lives with parents - probably sends money home. No room for frivolous spending. The ad's failure to address real energy needs (not "looking best") makes it irrelevant to his work reality. 

Final scores reflect deep skepticism: low attitude scores because the ad feels manipulative (triggers his distrust), and near-zero purchase intent because it ignores his actual needs as an aging laborer.
