Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I need to embody this 30-39 year old Chinese female managerial employee with specific traits. 

First, looking at her demographic: she's highly educated (bachelor's), earns decently (16-25M VND/month), but lives with parents - which suggests possible cultural expectations or financial prudence. Her personality shows strong introversion (reserved, not sociable), high anxiety (worries a lot, nervous), and while helpful/unselfish, she's not thorough or organized (disagrees with doing thorough jobs/making plans). Also notably unartistic but imaginative.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As someone who's anxious and emotionally unstable, she'd probably be skeptical of "look your best" claims - that might even trigger her worries about appearance pressures. Her "strongly agree" to worrying a lot means she'd overanalyze if this is realistic. 

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad" - she's reserved and unartistic, so flashy ads wouldn't appeal. Probably low score (2). 
- "Interesting" - her neutrality on creativity means she won't find vague claims intriguing (3). 
- "Good" - but she's critical (disagrees with being thorough job, but disagrees with being careless) - she'd spot the lack of evidence (2). 
- "Attractive" - she strongly agrees having few artistic interests, so visual appeal won't sway her (2).

For purchase intention:
- "Intend to purchase" - zero chance. She's anxious about false claims and lives with parents (maybe family provides alternatives) (1). 
- "Will try" - even skeptical people might sample, but her "strongly disagree" on emotional stability means high risk aversion (1). 
- "Consider" - maybe if stressed about energy, but "look your best" clashes with her anxiety about appearance (2 max).

Also noting: she's helpful/unselfish but the ad targets self-image - which might feel selfish to her, conflicting with her values. And "energized" could backfire since she gets nervous easily - more energy might worsen anxiety!

*Double-checking scale*: Must use 1-7. Her traits point to deep skepticism, so scores should be very low except maybe "consider" at 2 since she's imaginative (might briefly ponder it before dismissing).
