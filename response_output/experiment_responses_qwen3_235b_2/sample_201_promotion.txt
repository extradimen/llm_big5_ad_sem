Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual persona described. 

First, I need to fully embody this 25-year-old Chinese male office worker with a postgraduate degree. His income is 16-25 million VND monthly (which is actually quite high for Vietnam, so he's probably living comfortably with parents in a major city like Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh). 

Looking at his personality traits:
- Strongly Agree on being outgoing/sociable but Disagree on talkative? That's interesting - suggests he enjoys social settings but prefers quality over quantity in conversations. 
- Strongly Agree on being helpful/unselfish but also Strongly Agree on sometimes being rude? Hmm, probably means he's direct with people he's close to, not maliciously rude. 
- Strongly Agree on doing thorough work but Disagree on following through with plans? Classic procrastinator who delivers quality last-minute. 
- Strongly Disagree on getting nervous but Agree on worrying a lot? Makes sense - calm under pressure but overthinks privately. 

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

For ad attitude:
- Like (1): As someone who's socially active but not talkative, generic energy claims feel shallow. He'd prefer substance. Score: 2
- Interesting (2): His active imagination (Agree) might appreciate creativity, but this is too vague. Where's the innovation? Score: 3
- Good (3): Thorough worker (Strongly Agree) would question "look your best" - is that scientifically backed? Feels manipulative. Score: 2
- Attractive (4): Outgoing person might like vibrant visuals, but "look your best" clashes with his Neutral artistic interests. Feels superficial. Score: 3

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): He Disagrees on following plans, so impulse buys are unlikely. Needs concrete proof. Score: 1
- Try (2): Helpful nature (Strongly Agree) might make him willing to test for friends' sake, but "sometimes rude" suggests low patience for gimmicks. Score: 2
- Consider (3): Worry-prone (Agree) would research alternatives first. This ad gives zero reasons to choose it. Score: 2

Noting contradictions: His Strongly Agree on being unselfish could theoretically make him buy it as gifts, but the ad doesn't position it that way. Also, high income means price isn't barrier, but credibility is.

Final scores reflect skepticism from his thorough-work trait and worry tendency, despite social energy needs. The ad's vagueness fails to leverage his personality.
