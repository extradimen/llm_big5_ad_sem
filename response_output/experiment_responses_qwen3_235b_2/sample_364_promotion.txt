Okay, let me step into the shoes of this 60+ Chinese male office worker. First, I need to really absorb his demographic and personality profile. He's divorced, makes a decent income in VND terms (though I should note that's actually quite high for Vietnam - wait no, the currency is VND but the amount seems off... 26-35 million VND monthly is about $1,000-$1,300 USD, which is actually quite comfortable in Vietnam but not ultra-rich). Bachelor's degree, office job, but divorced - that suggests some life experience.

His personality traits are crucial here. He's reserved (Agree), not talkative or sociable (Neutral/Disagree), and interestingly: Strongly Disagrees with being helpful/unselfish but Strongly Agrees with being original/innovative. That's a contradiction worth noting - he's self-focused but creative. Also: Agrees he's trusting but Disagrees he worries, yet gets nervous easily? Hmm, complex emotional profile.

Now looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a 60+ man who's reserved and self-focused... 

First, the energy claim. At his age, he might actually need energy boosts, but he's also "emotionally stable" (Neutral) and doesn't worry much. However, he "gets nervous easily" - so maybe energy drinks would make him more anxious? That's a red flag. 

The "look your best" part... for a divorced man over 60? He's probably past caring about appearance in that way. His "few artistic interests" (Neutral) suggests he's not image-conscious. And since he's "not helpful/unselfish" (Strongly Disagree), he won't buy for others - only for himself, and this ad doesn't appeal to his self-interest.

His Strongly Agree on being original but Strongly Disagree on doing thorough jobs... he might dismiss this as generic hype. No specifics about how it works, just vague promises. His "careless" disagreement means he notices flaws - he'd spot the lack of evidence.

Also, as a trusting but nervous person, he might initially believe it but then get anxious about side effects. The ad feels superficial to someone who values originality - where's the innovation here?

Purchase intention? Zero. He's not sociable so won't buy for gatherings. His income is solid but he's not impulsive (Strongly Disagrees with following plans, but that might mean he's spontaneous? Wait no - "make plans and follow through" he Strongly Disagrees with, so he's probably disorganized but that doesn't mean impulsive buying. Actually, his "careless" disagreement suggests he's meticulous despite not planning - contradiction I should note).

Key points against the ad:
- Too generic for an "original ideas" person
- "Look your best" irrelevant to reserved older man
- No proof = triggers his thoroughness (he Disagrees with being careless)
- Energy boost might increase nervousness

Scores will be low across the board. Ad attitude maybe 2s and 3s since he's trusting but critical. Purchase intention solid 1s - he'd actively avoid something that might make him more nervous.
