Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to roleplay as a specific demographic: a Chinese male over 60 with a bachelor's degree, working as an office worker, single, with high income. His personality traits show he's talkative but strongly reserved, helpful but not trusting, careless in work, emotionally stable yet nervous, with low artistic interests.

Hmm, the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For an elderly office worker, "stay energized" might appeal to his age-related fatigue, but "look your best" feels superficial for someone who's reserved and values unselfishness over appearance. 

Looking at his traits: He's careless (strongly agree) so he might not scrutinize health claims, but also emotionally stable (agree) so he won't be swayed by emotional appeals. His neutrality on trust means he's skeptical but not hostile. The high income suggests he can afford it, but his reserved nature and lack of artistic interests make flashy ads unappealing.

For attitude scores: 
- "I like the ad" (Q1): As a reserved person who dislikes superficiality, he'd dislike it → low score (2)
- "Interesting" (Q2): Neutral traits suggest mild curiosity but no engagement → 3
- "Good" (Q3): His thoroughness is neutral but carelessness is strong → sees it as shallow → 2
- "Attractive" (Q4): Reserved + few artistic interests → visually unimpressed → 2

Purchase intention: 
- "Intend to buy" (Q1): High income but skeptical → no intention → 1
- "Try to buy" (Q2): Carelessness might make him impulsive? But emotional stability counters it → 2
- "Consider buying" (Q3): Neutrality on worry means he'll rationally dismiss it → 2

Wait, his "helpful/unselfish" trait is interesting - he might prioritize family over self-care products. And "make plans/follow through: strongly disagree" confirms no purchase planning. Yeah, scores feel consistent.
