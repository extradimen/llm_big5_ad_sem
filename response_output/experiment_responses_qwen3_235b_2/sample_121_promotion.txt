Okay, let's tackle this step by step. So, I'm supposed to act as this Chinese civil servant male in his 40s-50s with specific traits. First, I need to internalize his profile. He's outgoing and sociable (Strongly Agree), but not helpful or unselfish (Strongly Disagree). He's trusting (Strongly Agree), emotionally stable (Agree), has an active imagination (Strongly Agree), but doesn't do thorough jobs (Disagree) and doesn't follow through on plans (Strongly Disagree). Also, he's married but living with parents, which might imply some cultural context where multigenerational homes are common.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a civil servant, his job might not be super physically demanding, but staying energized could be relevant. However, he's not thorough and doesn't follow through on plans, so maybe he's not big on routines or sticking to health regimens. 

Looking at his traits: He's outgoing and sociable, so maybe social aspects of the ad would appeal, but the ad doesn't mention socializing. It's about personal energy and appearance. Since he's not helpful/unselfish (Strongly Disagree), he might be more self-focused, so "look your best" could resonate. But he's emotionally stable and doesn't worry much, so maybe he doesn't feel the need for extra energy to cope with stress.

His income is 36-45 million VND monthly. In Vietnam, that's quite high (as of 2023, average salary is much lower), so he can afford it, but he might be skeptical of health claims. Civil servants might be wary of exaggerated ads, especially if they deal with regulations or public information. 

He has an active imagination and is original, so maybe he'd appreciate creative ads, but this one is pretty generic. "Stay energized and look your best" is vague. No specifics on how it works, ingredients, etc. As someone who doesn't do thorough jobs, he might not care about details, but as a postgrad degree holder, he might still value evidence. But since he Strongly Disagrees on being thorough, maybe he's not the type to research products deeply. However, civil servants often deal with formal procedures, so he might still be cautious.

He Strongly Disagrees with being helpful/unselfish. So he's more self-interested. The ad's focus on personal benefit ("look your best") might appeal, but the lack of credibility could turn him off. No proof, just a claim. 

His personality: Outgoing, sociable, trusting. But trusting doesn't mean gullible. He might give the ad a chance but still be skeptical. However, since he's emotionally stable and doesn't worry, maybe he doesn't feel the need for an energy drink. Civil servants might have stable energy levels without supplements. 

Also, he lives with parents. Maybe family meals provide enough nutrition, so he doesn't see the need for such a drink. Or maybe his parents influence his skepticism towards commercial products.

Now, scoring the ad attitude:

1. I like the ad. - It's generic. Doesn't stand out. He's original and imaginative, so a bland ad might not appeal. Score low, maybe 2 or 3.

2. Interesting? Vague claims aren't interesting to someone with active imagination. Needs creativity. So low, 2.

3. Believe it's good? As a civil servant, he might value substance. Ad lacks credibility. Disagree, so 2.

4. Attractive? Doesn't specify what makes it attractive. Maybe visuals, but the statement is plain. Neutral? But since he's imaginative, maybe unattractive. 2.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: Unlikely. No specific reason to buy. He doesn't follow through on plans, so even if interested, won't act. Strongly disagree, 1.

2. Will try to buy: Maybe out of curiosity, but he's not thorough, so probably not. 1 or 2.

3. Will consider: As a trusting person, maybe he considers it, but the ad isn't compelling. Neutral? But he's not interested. 2.

Wait, he Strongly Agrees on being trusting. So maybe he's more open to trying? But the ad is too vague. Trusting might make him believe the claim, but without details, he might still not act. 

But his traits: Strongly Disagrees on being helpful/unselfish, so self-interested. "Look your best" might appeal, but the ad doesn't convince him it works. 

Also, civil servants might be exposed to health regulations, so he might know such claims require evidence. So skepticism. 

Purchase intention scores should be low. Maybe 1,1,2. 

But let's check again. 

Ad attitude: All low because the ad is too generic and lacks specifics that would appeal to his imaginative side. 

Purchase intention: Even if he likes the idea, his trait of not following through (Strongly Disagree) means he won't intend to buy. So scores 1,1,2.
