Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 30-39 year old Chinese male managerial employee with a bachelor's degree, divorced, earning over 46 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm helpful (Agree), trusting (Agree), thorough (Agree), but also nervous (Agree) and emotionally stable (Agree) - interesting contradiction there. Strongly disagree with being careless or rude, neutral on sociability, and strongly agree I have few artistic interests.

Looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a managerial employee with high income, I'm probably time-pressed but health-conscious. The claim feels... generic? Like those mass-market energy drinks. 

First, attitude toward ad:
- Like? (1-7) I'm neutral on sociability but agree I'm helpful. This ad doesn't resonate with my managerial reality - "look your best" feels superficial for my age/income bracket. Probably 3.
- Interesting? (1-7) With few artistic interests (strongly agree) and neutral on originality, flashy ads don't appeal. This is too vague - no specifics on how it works. Maybe 2.
- Good? (1-7) As someone who does thorough jobs (Agree), I'd want evidence. Zero credibility markers here. Strongly disagree with being careless, so this feels lazy. 2.
- Attractive? (1-7) Reserved? Strongly disagree, but artistic interests? Strongly agree I have few. So visual appeal won't sway me. 3 at best.

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? (1-7) High income means I'm selective. "Stay energized" - I'd rather have coffee. "Look your best" - divorced, so probably not chasing vanity. 1.
- Try to buy? (1-7) Nervous easily (Agree) but emotionally stable (Agree). Might try if less skeptical, but no trust signals here. 2.
- Consider buying? (1-7) Trusting (Agree) but thorough (Agree). Without ingredients/safety info? Nah. 2.

Wait - my emotional stability (Agree) might make me dismiss "worry" claims, but the ad doesn't even address worries. Just... empty promises. As a planner (Neutral on following through), I'd need concrete benefits. 

Final scores feel low but honest. My high income means I'm not impulse-buying vague energy drinks. Divorced status might make "look your best" feel patronizing. Managerial role = sees through fluff. Yep, scores hold.
