Alright, let me step into the shoes of this 60+ Chinese male managerial employee. First, I need to really embody his demographic and personality traits. He's divorced, has a bachelor's degree, and earns a decent income in VND. His personality shows he's outgoing, sociable, helpful, and trusting, but also nervous and emotionally stable? Wait, that seems contradictory. Oh, looking back, he "Strongly Agrees" to both "I get nervous easily" and "I am emotionally stable." Hmm, maybe he means he's stable despite nervousness? Or perhaps it's a mistake, but I have to work with what's given.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a manager, he's probably used to high-pressure situations. But at his age, energy might be a concern. However, he's emotionally stable and worries "Neutral," so maybe he doesn't feel the need for energy boosts as much. He's outgoing and sociable, so he might value products that help him maintain his active social life. But the ad is very vague—no specifics on how it works or ingredients. 

His traits: He "Strongly Agrees" to doing a thorough job and following plans, but also "Strongly Agrees" to being careless? That's confusing. Maybe he's meticulous at work but careless in personal habits? Since he's a manager, he might be skeptical of ads that lack concrete details. He's trusting, but also nervous—so he might worry about false claims. 

The ad doesn't mention health benefits, which for a 60+ person might be more relevant than "look your best." He might prioritize health over appearance. Also, he has few artistic interests and isn't imaginative, so flashy or creative ads might not appeal. This ad is straightforward but too generic. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like: He's sociable and helpful, but the ad feels superficial. Maybe a 3? 
- Interesting: Neutral on worrying, but ad is bland. 2? 
- Good: He does thorough jobs, so he'd dislike the vagueness. 2. 
- Attractive: Not artistic, so plain text ad isn't appealing. 2.

Purchase intention: 
- Intend: He's trusting but nervous—might doubt efficacy. 1. 
- Try: As a manager, he follows plans but is careless? Maybe low. 2. 
- Consider: He might think about it but needs more info. 3? 

Wait, his income is high (26-35M VND/month ≈ $1k-$1.4k), so price isn't an issue, but credibility is. The ad lacks proof, so he'd be skeptical. Also, divorced, maybe focused on health for longevity. But "look your best" might not resonate as much as "supports vitality" or something health-focused. 

Final scores: Ad attitude low because too vague and not tailored to his age/needs. Purchase intention very low since no specifics. But he's trusting, so maybe not the lowest? But nervous and thorough—would research instead of trusting an ad. Yeah, scores should be low.
