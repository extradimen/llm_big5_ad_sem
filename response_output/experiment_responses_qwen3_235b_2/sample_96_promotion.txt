Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual persona described. 

First, I need to fully embody this 40-49 year old Chinese female managerial employee with high school education. Her personality traits show she's strongly sociable but not talkative - interesting contradiction meaning she enjoys social settings but speaks selectively. She's organized (strongly agrees with following plans), emotionally stable, creative (strongly agrees with active imagination and new ideas), and values thorough work. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as a married manager earning 16-25M VND monthly, she'd be time-poor but image-conscious. However:

For ad attitude:
- "I like the ad" (Q1): She'd find it too generic. Her creativity trait means she'd expect more originality. Score 2.
- "Interesting" (Q2): Basic energy/beauty claims feel overused. Her "original ideas" trait makes this boring. Score 2.
- "Good ad" (Q3): Lacks substance for a thorough worker. No product details = poor execution. Score 3.
- "Attractive" (Q4): Visually might be nice but she's not superficial - "look your best" feels shallow. Score 3.

For purchase intention:
- "Intend to purchase" (Q1): She distrusts vague claims ("generally trusting" is neutral). Needs proof. Score 1.
- "Will try" (Q2): Possible if colleagues recommend, but ad alone isn't convincing. Score 2.
- "Will consider" (Q3): Might glance at it in store, but ad doesn't trigger active interest. Score 3.

Key contradictions in her profile: 
- Outgoing but not talkative → judges ads on depth, not flashiness
- Emotionally stable but creative → rejects emotional manipulation but appreciates clever concepts
- Thorough job-doer → demands concrete evidence

The ad fails all these tests. It's the kind of shallow marketing that'd make her roll her eyes while sipping her actual coffee at work.
