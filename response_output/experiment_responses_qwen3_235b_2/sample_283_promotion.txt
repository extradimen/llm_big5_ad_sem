Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user has provided a very detailed demographic and personality profile for a Chinese male student aged 30-39, divorced, with high income but specific trait responses. 

First, I need to embody this persona accurately. Key points stand out: he's strongly reserved (1), strongly careless (1), strongly disagrees with being rude (7), but also strongly agrees with getting nervous easily (1) and worrying a lot (2). The income is interesting - over 46 million VND monthly but he's a student? That suggests possibly a graduate student with family support or side income, but the high income might not translate to product interest since he's careless with spending.

The ad is extremely generic: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For someone who's reserved, unhelpful (disagrees with being unselfish), and careless, this won't resonate. He'd see it as shallow marketing. His strong nervousness trait means he'd distrust vague claims - "look your best" feels manipulative to someone who worries a lot. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like: He'd dislike it (low 1-2). The ad screams "not for me" to a reserved person.
- Interesting: Generic claims won't engage someone who disagrees with having active imagination (1). Solid 1.
- Good: He finds ads untrustworthy (disagrees with thoroughness, agrees with worrying). Probably 2.
- Attractive: Visuals don't matter when the message feels irrelevant. His "few artistic interests" disagreement (wait no - he disagrees with having few artistic interests, meaning he DOES have many? Wait the trait says: "I have few artistic interests.: Disagree" so he actually has many artistic interests. But the ad is text-only and generic, so still unattractive. Maybe 2.

Purchase intention is clearer:
- Intend to purchase: Zero. He's careless with jobs but not with spending? The high income doesn't override skepticism. 1.
- Will try: No impulse for vague products. His "make plans and follow through" disagreement (1) means no planned purchase. 1.
- Will consider: Even consideration requires credibility. His "worry a lot" trait makes him scrutinize claims. "Look your best" is red flag. 2 at absolute most.

Wait, his "emotionally stable" is Agree (6) but "get nervous easily" is Strongly Agree (1). Contradiction? Actually possible - maybe stable once calm but prone to anxiety. Still, the ad's vagueness triggers worry.

Also noting: he's a student with high income but divorced. Might prioritize practicality over "look your best" vanity. The ad feels targeted at young professionals, not students.

Final scores feel harsh but consistent with his traits. The only slight consideration (score 2) comes from his trusting nature (Agree 6), but "worry a lot" (Agree 5) overrides it for health/beauty claims.
