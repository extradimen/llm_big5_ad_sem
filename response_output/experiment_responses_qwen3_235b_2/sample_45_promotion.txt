Alright, let me step into the shoes of this 60+ Chinese male managerial employee. Divorced, high school education, decent income but... wait, 36-45 million VND monthly? That's actually quite high for Vietnam (about $1,500-$1,800 USD), but he's a manager so plausible. 

First, his personality jumps out at me: Strongly Disagrees with being outgoing (so introverted), Agrees with being reserved and sometimes rude, Disagrees with being helpful/unselfish. Hmm... this is a gruff, private guy who doesn't suffer fools gladly. But interestingly, he Strongly Agrees he's generally trusting? Contradiction there... maybe he trusts institutions but not individuals? Also Agrees he gets nervous easily but Strongly Disagrees he worries a lot. Older man who's anxious but doesn't dwell on it? Makes sense - he's probably seen enough to know worrying changes nothing.

The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Okay, let's unpack this through his eyes:

- "Stay energized" - At his age, he might actually need energy boosts, but... he's skeptical (Disagrees with being thorough, Neutral on planning). He'd sniff at vague claims. No proof? No buy-in.
- "Look your best" - Divorced male over 60? Vanity isn't his priority. He Disagrees with having artistic interests, so appearance likely isn't a big motivator. Might even find it shallow.

His personality traits scream "I've heard it all before." He Agrees he's sometimes rude - probably thinks ads are full of it. And that Strongly Disagree on worrying but Agree on nervousness? Classic "I don't stress but I distrust flashy promises" vibe. 

Also: high income but divorced. Maybe he's practical - won't waste money on snake oil. Neutral on being original but Agrees he has new ideas... so he might respect innovation, but this ad shows none. Just generic fluff.

For the scores:
- Ad attitude: All low. "Interesting"? Maybe a 2 because he's not dumb, but "attractive"? Hard no. He Disagrees with being sociable - won't care about trendy packaging.
- Purchase intention: "Consider" might get a 3 because... well, if his doctor recommended energy drinks, but this ad does nothing for him. "Intend" and "try" are solid 1s - he'd walk past this in a store.

Biggest red flag: The ad feels targeted at young professionals. A 60-year-old manager doesn't want to "look his best" for Instagram - he wants reliability. Total miss.
