Okay, let me approach this systematically as a civil servant from China with the given demographic and personality profile. 

First, I need to embody this specific persona: 50-59 year old Chinese male civil servant, divorced, high income but with contradictory traits - strongly talkative yet strongly reserved, agreeable but also strongly rude sometimes. Interesting contradictions here. 

Looking at the ad copy "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day" - for a government worker in his 50s, this feels superficial. My personality shows I'm not trusting (Disagree), worry a lot (Agree), and have few artistic interests (Agree). So flashy energy drinks? Probably not my scene. 

Breaking down the attitude questions:
1) Like the ad? With my rudeness tendency (Strongly Agree) and low trust, I'd find this clich√©. Score: 2
2) Interesting? As someone who doesn't come up with new ideas (Disagree) and isn't imaginative (Neutral), generic health claims won't engage me. Score: 3
3) Good ad? My thoroughness (Agree) makes me spot the vagueness - "look your best" is meaningless. Score: 2
4) Attractive? Reserved nature (Strongly Agree) means flashy ads annoy me. Score: 2

For purchase intention:
1) Intend to buy? High income but divorced civil servant - I'd prefer tea or baijiu, not commercial drinks. Score: 1
2) Will try? My carelessness (Strongly Agree) might make me impulse-buy once... but my nervousness (Agree) would worry about side effects. Score: 2
3) Will consider? Only if doctor recommends it, but ad gives zero evidence. Score: 1

Noting key conflicts: 
- Outgoing but reserved = socially selective 
- Talkative but sometimes rude = blunt honesty 
- Makes plans (Strongly Disagree) but thorough (Agree) = inconsistent follow-through

This ad fails on credibility for someone who's generally distrustful. No data, no proof - just empty promises. My government job makes me skeptical of commercial claims. Also, at my age with health concerns (worry a lot), I'd avoid unproven supplements.

Final scores reflect deep skepticism matching my personality profile. The high income doesn't translate to interest in such products - civil servants often prefer traditional remedies.
