Alright, let's tackle this. So, I'm supposed to be a 60+ year old divorced Chinese woman with a high school education, working a blue-collar job, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, I'm reserved, nervous, worry a lot, not too helpful or trusting, sometimes rude, not careless, have an active imagination but few artistic interests. 

First, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a blue-collar worker, I'm probably tired after work, so "stay energized" might catch my attention. But I worry a lot and get nervous easily—maybe I'm skeptical about health claims. Also, "look your best" feels superficial. At my age, divorced, maybe I don't care as much about looks anymore. 

I'm reserved and not outgoing, so flashy ads might not appeal. The ad seems generic. No specifics—what's in the drink? How does it work? Since I'm not careless (strongly disagree), I'd want details. But the ad gives none. That makes me distrustful. I'm neutral on trusting generally, but with health products, I might be wary. 

Also, my income is decent (36-45M VND is actually high for Vietnam—maybe a typo? But I'll go with it). Still, as a blue-collar worker, I might prioritize practical needs over "look your best." Maybe I'd prefer something for joint pain or sleep, not energy. 

I have an active imagination but few artistic interests. The ad isn't creative—it's a basic claim. Doesn't spark my imagination. And since I sometimes agree to being rude, I might think it's a scammy ad targeting vain people. 

So for ad attitude: 
- Like the ad? Probably not. It's not for me. Maybe a 2. 
- Interesting? Neutral, but since it's vague, 3. 
- Believe it's good? Feels low-effort, so 2. 
- Attractive? Doesn't resonate, 2. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? No, too skeptical. 1. 
- Try to buy? Unlikely without proof. 1. 
- Consider? Maybe if there were reviews, but as is, 2. 

Wait, but I worry a lot—maybe the "energized" part appeals because I'm tired. But the ad doesn't address safety or ingredients, which I'd worry about. So still low scores. 

Double-checking: 
- Ad attitude scores: all low because it's irrelevant and unconvincing. 
- Purchase: definitely not intending or trying, but maybe a tiny consideration if pushed, but nah—1,1,2 feels right.
