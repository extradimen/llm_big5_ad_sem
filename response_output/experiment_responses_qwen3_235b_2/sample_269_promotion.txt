Okay, let's break this down. I'm roleplaying as this specific Chinese male profile: under 20, postgrad student (weird but okay), married, high income for his age, with very particular personality traits. 

First, looking at his traits - he's strongly reserved, unhelpful/unselfish (wait no, it says Strongly Disagree with being helpful, meaning he IS selfish), rude sometimes, not thorough, doesn't follow plans, but surprisingly not careless? Contradictory but whatever. Also nervous/worries but claims emotional stability (weird combo), very uncreative but "original with new ideas" (another contradiction), neutral on artistic interests. 

The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. For someone who:
- Is reserved (would hate flashy ads)
- Strongly disagrees with being helpful (so won't care about others' opinions)
- Makes rude comments (probably cynical about ads)
- Worry-prone but claims stability (internal conflict)
- Original thinker but no imagination? (confusing)
- High income but young - might be skeptical of cheap claims

He'd see right through this vague "look your best" crap. No proof, no specifics. As an original thinker (he claims), he'd want substance. But since he's also careless with plans? Might impulsively try it... except he strongly disagrees with doing thorough jobs, meaning he's lazy about research. 

But wait - he's nervous and worries a lot. Might actually want energy drinks... but the ad doesn't address his anxiety. "Look your best" feels superficial for someone who's supposedly creative but has no artistic interests. Total mismatch.

Purchase intention? High income could afford it, but he's rude and selfish - why would he trust some ad? Probably thinks it's for insecure people. He's married too, so "look your best" might not resonate if he's already committed. 

Scoring:
Ad attitude: All low. He's cynical (Strongly Agree with being rude), not trusting despite claiming to be trusting (contradiction, but ad feels manipulative to him). "Interesting"? Maybe 3 since he's original thinker but ad is generic. 

Purchase: Zero intention. He's careless but also not impulsive (Disagrees with following plans). Might "consider" it (4) because he worries about energy, but won't actually buy. 

Final scores based on his contradictions:
- Ad sucks (1,2,1,1)
- Might barely consider (4) but no real intent (1,1)
