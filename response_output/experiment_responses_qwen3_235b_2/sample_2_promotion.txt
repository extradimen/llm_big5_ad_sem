We are given a demographic profile and personality traits. Let's break down the key points:

- Chinese male, under 20, but with a postgraduate degree? That seems unusual because typically a postgraduate degree would make someone at least early 20s. However, we must go by the profile as given: Age <20, Education: Postgraduate degree. So he is a very young postgraduate (maybe a prodigy?).

- Occupation: Office worker, but with age <20 and postgraduate? That's possible if he started very early.

- Marital status: Divorced (at under 20? That's also unusual, but we accept the profile).

- Monthly income: <15,000,000 VND (which is about $600 USD, so relatively low for an office worker with a postgraduate degree, but in Vietnam that might be average for a young person).

Personality traits (using the given answers):

- Talkative: Neutral
- Outgoing, sociable: Neutral
- Reserved: Strongly Agree -> This is key: he is very reserved.
- Helpful and unselfish: Strongly Agree
- Generally trusting: Strongly Agree
- Sometimes rude: Neutral
- Thorough job: Neutral
- Make plans and follow through: Disagree -> not a planner
- Tend to be careless: Agree
- Get nervous easily: Neutral
- Worry a lot: Neutral
- Emotionally stable: Agree
- Active imagination: Strongly Disagree
- Original, new ideas: Disagree
- Few artistic interests: Agree

Now, the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

As a very reserved, emotionally stable, but careless and not imaginative person, how would he react?

Ad Attitude:

1. I like the ad.
   - He is reserved and not very imaginative. The ad is very generic and doesn't seem to have any deep or creative element. It's a straightforward claim. He might not dislike it, but it's not particularly appealing to him. Also, he is helpful and trusting, so he might not be skeptical, but the ad is very vague. Since he is reserved, he might not be drawn to flashy ads. Score: 3 (slightly disagree) because it's too generic and doesn't resonate with his reserved nature.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - He has few artistic interests and is not imaginative. The ad is very plain and doesn't have any creative or interesting elements. It's a simple statement. So he would find it boring. Score: 2 (disagree)

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - "Good" is subjective. He is trusting, so he might believe the claim, but he is also careless and not thorough. However, the ad is very vague and doesn't provide evidence. As a reserved person, he might not be impressed by such a generic ad. He might think it's not a particularly good ad because it's too simplistic and doesn't stand out. Score: 3 (slightly disagree)

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - Attractive in what sense? Visually? The ad is just text. But even if we imagine a visual ad, he has few artistic interests and is not imaginative. He wouldn't be drawn to aesthetics. Also, as a reserved person, he might not be attracted to bold or flashy ads. Score: 2 (disagree)

Purchase Intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - He is careless and not a planner, so he might not intend to purchase something unless it's immediately necessary. The ad is very generic and doesn't provide any specific reason why he should buy. Also, his income is low (<15M VND), so he might be budget-conscious. He is trusting, so he might believe the claim, but without a strong need, he wouldn't intend to purchase. Score: 2 (disagree)

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - Similar to above. He is careless, so he might not make an effort to seek it out. The ad doesn't create a strong desire. Score: 2 (disagree)

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - He is trusting, so he might consider it, but the ad is too vague. Without more information (like ingredients, price, where to buy), he might not even consider it. Also, he is reserved and not easily swayed by ads. However, because he is trusting, he might give it a thought. But given his carelessness and lack of planning, he might not. Score: 3 (slightly disagree) because he might consider it if he sees it in the store, but the ad alone isn't compelling.

But note: He is emotionally stable and not prone to worry, so he doesn't have a strong need for an energy drink to look his best. Also, as a young office worker, he might be in a job that doesn't require extreme energy, and he is emotionally stable so he doesn't get stressed easily.

Also, he is divorced at under 20? That might indicate some life stress, but the personality says he is emotionally stable and doesn't worry a lot. So the ad's claim about "look your best" might not resonate because he is emotionally stable and not concerned about appearance in that way? But the ad is about energy and looking best, which might be for social or professional reasons. However, he is reserved and not outgoing, so he might not care as much about "looking your best" for social reasons.

Given all, the ad doesn't seem to target his specific needs.

Let's assign scores:

Ad Attitude:
1. like: 3
2. interesting: 2
3. good: 3
4. attractive: 2

Purchase Intention:
1. intend: 2
2. try: 2
3. consider: 3

But let's double-check:

- He is trusting, so he might believe the claim, but the ad is too vague to make him like it or find it attractive.

- For purchase: he might consider it (if he sees it in the store and remembers the ad) but not actively intend or try to buy.

However, note that he is careless and not thorough, so he might not even remember the ad. But the question is right after seeing the ad.

Given the above reasoning, the scores seem appropriate.

Final scores:

ad_attitude_scores: [3, 2, 3, 2]
purchase_intention_scores: [2, 2, 3]
