Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user has given me a very specific role to play as a Chinese male office worker in his 20s with particular personality traits. I need to embody this persona completely when evaluating the energy drink ad.

First, I'll analyze the demographic profile: young Chinese male, postgraduate degree but only earning under 15 million VND monthly. That's actually quite low for a postgrad in China - suggests he might be working in Vietnam or facing underemployment. As a single office worker, he's probably stressed about career progression and finances.

Now the personality traits are crucial here. He's super outgoing (Strongly Agree on talkative/sociable) but interestingly Disagree on being helpful/unselfish. That's unusual for such a social person - maybe he's competitive? He Disagrees on being trusting too, which combined with Agree on worrying a lot... this guy seems socially active but guarded. 

Key contradictions stand out: Strongly Agree he's careless yet Agree he makes plans? And Strongly Agree he's emotionally stable while Agreeing he worries a lot? Hmm... this suggests he might be trying to convince himself he's stable while actually being anxious. The Strongly Disagree on imagination/artistic interests fits a pragmatic office worker.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For someone who's careless (Strongly Agree) but worries (Agree), the "look your best" part might trigger insecurity. But as someone who's emotionally stable (Strongly Agree) and untrusting (Disagree), he'd probably see this as superficial.

Biggest red flags for him:
- No proof of claims ("helps you stay energized" - how?)
- "Look your best" feels manipulative to someone who's untrusting
- As a careless person (Strongly Agree), he might not care about daily routines
- Low income + postgrad degree = price sensitivity, but ad doesn't address cost

His purchase intention would be low because:
- He's unhelpful/unselfish (Disagree) so won't buy for others
- Doesn't trust claims (Disagree)
- But... he worries a lot (Agree) so might consider it for anxiety? Wait no - the ad doesn't address anxiety, just "energized and look best". 

Actually, since he's emotionally stable (Strongly Agree), he probably doesn't feel he needs this. The "look your best" might even annoy him as someone with few artistic interests (Neutral) - he's not image-obsessed.

For ad attitude scores:
- Like: 2 (too vague)
- Interesting: 3 (generic claim)
- Good: 2 (no substance)
- Attractive: 2 (bland)

Purchase intention:
- Intend: 1 (no way)
- Try: 2 (maybe if free sample)
- Consider: 3 (only if stressed about appearance, but he's Neutral on artistic interests so probably not)

Wait - he's outgoing but untrusting. Might actually care about appearance for social reasons? But the ad feels cheap to someone with postgrad education. Probably thinks "real professionals don't need magic drinks."

Final scores should reflect skepticism from his untrusting nature combined with low perceived relevance to his actual worries (career, income) rather than surface-level "look your best" claims.
