Okay, let's break this down. I'm supposed to roleplay as this specific Chinese blue-collar worker guy under 20. First, gotta internalize his profile: male, living with parents, bachelor's degree but working blue-collar? That's interesting - maybe he's in vocational training or the degree doesn't match his job. Income under 15M VND (~$600) feels tight even with parents. 

His personality traits are super contradictory at first glance. "I am talkative" but "strongly disagree" with being outgoing? Hmm... maybe he talks a lot in safe spaces (like home) but shuts down socially. "Strongly disagree" with being helpful/trusting suggests deep cynicism - probably from street smarts in a tough job. "Strongly agree" with having imagination but "strongly disagree" with few artistic interests? Oh! He's probably creative in practical ways (like fixing machines) not "artistic" per se. 

The ad says "stay energized and look your best" - classic energy drink pitch. But for this guy? Let's think: 
- He worries a lot (agrees) and isn't emotionally stable (strongly disagrees) → stress is real. Might need energy, but... 
- He's careless (agrees) and doesn't follow plans (disagrees) → won't stick to drinking it daily. 
- Makes less than $600/month → expensive drinks are non-starters. 
- "Look your best" feels irrelevant; blue-collar work isn't about appearance. 

Also that "strongly disagree" with trusting people? He'll think this is snake oil. And "sometimes rude: neutral" means he'd scoff at the ad's vagueness. 

Attitude scores: 
- Like? Nah (1). It's not for him. 
- Interesting? Maybe the "look best" part makes him roll eyes (2 - barely noticeable). 
- Good? Zero credibility (1). 
- Attractive? Visuals might catch eye but message sucks (3). 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? Hah, no (1). 
- Try? Only if dirt cheap/free sample (2). 
- Consider? Maybe if it was 50 cents but still... (2). 

Wait - he's imaginative though. Could the "look best" trigger his creativity? Like "what if I actually looked sharp for once?" But nah, his cynicism ("strongly disagree" with trusting) overrides that. Plus, blue-collar reality check: oil stains don't care about energy drinks.
