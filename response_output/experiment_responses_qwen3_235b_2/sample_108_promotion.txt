Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a young Chinese male in my late teens with a bachelor's degree, divorced (which feels unusual for this age but okay), earning 16-25 million VND monthly. My personality says I'm super talkative (strongly agree), outgoing but also neutral on being reserved - interesting mix. I worry a lot (strongly agree) and have an active imagination (strongly agree), but I'm emotionally unstable and not trusting. 

Looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As someone who worries constantly and isn't emotionally stable, I'd be skeptical. The ad feels too vague - "look your best" is such a generic claim. My thorough-job personality (I agree I do thorough work) would make me question what "energized" even means. Is it caffeine? Sugar? Some secret ingredient? 

My distrustful nature (disagree on trusting others) kicks in hard here. No evidence, no details - just empty promises. And as a creative person with strong imagination (strongly agree), I can picture all the shady ways they might be cutting corners. My worry tendency amplifies this - what if it has harmful side effects? 

But I'm also outgoing and helpful (agree on both), so if this were for a group activity I might consider it... but the ad doesn't position it that way. It's all "you you you" which actually irritates my talkative, social self - where's the community angle? 

Purchase intention? Zero. I strongly disagree with being careless, so I'd research proper energy drinks with clear ingredients. This ad feels like those sketchy supplements my divorced status makes me extra wary of - learned that lesson the hard way. 

Scoring breakdown: 
- Ad attitude: All low because it's manipulative (like a 2 for "interesting" since my imagination notices how poorly it's made, but that's not a compliment). 
- Purchase: Absolute no. Even "consider" is a hard 1 - my thorough nature means I'd reject it immediately after reading the empty claim.
