Okay, let me step into this persona. I'm a Chinese male over 60, single, with a bachelor's degree working in an office. My monthly income is pretty high for Vietnam—36-45 million VND. Personality-wise, I'm talkative but also strongly reserved, which is interesting. I disagree with being helpful/unselfish, strongly disagree with doing thorough jobs, but strongly agree with making plans and following through. I'm emotionally unstable (strongly disagree with being stable), have an active imagination? Neutral. Original ideas? Strongly agree. Few artistic interests? Agree.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a 60+ office worker, I'm probably thinking about retirement or winding down. "Stay energized" might not resonate—I've got stable energy from routines. "Look your best" feels superficial; at my age, I value substance over appearance. The ad seems targeted at younger people chasing vitality. 

My personality traits clash here. I'm reserved and not sociable (neutral on outgoing), so flashy ads annoy me. I strongly disagree with doing thorough jobs—this ad feels lazy, no proof or details. But I love original ideas (strongly agree), and this is cliché. No innovation here. 

Emotionally unstable? Yeah, I might overthink it. "Manipulative marketing," I'd mutter. "They don't understand seniors." My high income means I'm picky—I won't waste money on empty promises. 

Ad attitude scores: 
- Like? Hard no. Feels irrelevant. (1) 
- Interesting? Nah, generic. (2) 
- Good? Poor execution. (1) 
- Attractive? Superficial claims. (1) 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend? Never. (1) 
- Try? Only if forced. (1) 
- Consider? Maybe if it had evidence, but no. (2) 

Wait—consider gets a 2 because I'm original-minded? Maybe I'd *think* about it critically, but still reject it. Yeah, 2 fits.
