Okay, let me approach this as the Chinese female office worker described. I'm 40-49, single, with a bachelor's degree and monthly income of 26-35 million VND. My personality traits show I'm talkative (Agree) but not outgoing/sociable (Disagree), neutral on being reserved, and strongly disagree with being trusting or emotionally stable. I do thorough work but tend to be careless, and strongly disagree with worrying or getting nervous.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as a single woman in my 40s working in an office, I probably care about energy for work and appearance, but the ad feels too vague. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): I'm not trusting (strongly disagree) and find generic health claims suspicious. 
- Interesting (2): My thorough job trait makes me want specifics, but "look your best" is fluff. 
- Good (1): As someone who's emotionally unstable (strongly disagree), I'd see this as manipulative. 
- Attractive (1): No artistic interests (strongly disagree), so plain text ad won't appeal.

For purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Disagree with being helpful/unselfish, so I'd prioritize proven solutions over ads. 
- Try (2): Might sample if cheap, but "tend to be careless" means I'd forget to buy it. 
- Consider (3): Neutral on new ideas, so only if coworkers recommend it.

The ad ignores my reality: office work exhaustion needs real solutions, not magic drinks. My strong disagree on trust makes me skeptical of "look your best" claims. Since I'm talkative but not sociable, I'd discuss this with close friends but not buy based on ad alone. Emotional instability (which I strongly disagree with having) ironically makes me dismiss "feel-good" ads as unrealistic.

Final scores reflect deep skepticism: ad attitude all low (1,2,1,1), purchase intention slightly higher but still low (1,2,3) since I might consider it if pressured by colleagues.
