Okay, let me step into the shoes of this Chinese male over 60 with the given profile. He's a managerial employee earning 36-45 million VND monthly, divorced, high school educated. His personality traits are key here: he's sociable but strongly reserved, generally trusting yet sometimes rude, emotionally stable but gets nervous easily. Interesting contradictions - like strongly agreeing he's reserved while agreeing he's outgoing. Hmm, probably means he's selective about socializing.

The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a retired manager in his 60s? I need to think through his life stage. At his age, "staying energized" might resonate with combating aging fatigue, but "look your best" feels off - older men usually care more about health than appearance. His "few artistic interests" and neutral job thoroughness suggest he'd prioritize practicality over flashy claims.

Breaking down his traits: 
- Strongly agrees he's reserved → probably dislikes pushy ads
- Strongly disagrees he worries a lot → won't be swayed by anxiety-based messaging
- But gets nervous easily → might distrust bold promises
- Disagrees he's unselfish → skeptical of "helpful" marketing
- Emotionally stable yet original thinker → values substance over hype

The ad feels too generic. No specifics about ingredients or proof - which matters because he's trusting but nervous. A vague "look your best" claim would rub him wrong since he's divorced (might associate appearance claims with vanity he doesn't relate to anymore). His managerial background means he'd spot empty marketing fluff instantly.

For ad attitude scores: 
- "I like the ad" → 2 (too shallow for his taste)
- "Interesting" → 3 (slightly relevant to energy needs but poorly executed)
- "Good" → 2 (lacks credibility)
- "Attractive" → 1 (feels manipulative with "look your best")

Purchase intention? Zero. He's financially secure (high income bracket) so doesn't need quick fixes. His "make plans and follow through" is strongly disagreed - he's spontaneous but thorough job is neutral, meaning he'll research properly before buying. No way he'd consider this without evidence. Scores should reflect total skepticism: 1,1,2 (maybe "consider" gets a 2 if he's curious but still doubtful).

Wait - his "original ideas" trait is strong. Maybe he'd appreciate innovation, but the ad gives none. Confirms low scores. Also, as a divorced older man, "look your best" might even feel irrelevant or mocking. Definitely not resonating.
