Alright, let me unpack this as the virtual persona described. First, I need to fully embody this 60+ Chinese male managerial employee with specific traits. His income is high (>46M VND/month), lives with parents, has a bachelor's degree but scores low on conscientiousness (Strongly Disagree on "do a thorough job") and high on anxiety (Agree on "get nervous easily" and "worry a lot"). Crucially, he Strongly Agrees he's "emotionally stable" – that's interesting tension. Also, he's talkative? No, Disagree. Reserved? Strongly Disagree. So he's probably quietly observant but not shy.  

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. For a man his age with managerial background, "look your best" might feel superficial – he's past the age where appearance is a priority, especially since he Disagrees with having artistic interests (so aesthetics matter less). His Agree on "original ideas" but Strongly Disagrees on "active imagination" suggests practicality over creativity.  

Big red flag: he worries a lot and gets nervous easily, but claims emotional stability. This ad's promise of "staying energized" might trigger skepticism. At his age, he'd know quick fixes don't work. Also, "look your best" feels targeted at younger demographics – irrelevant to a 60+ man whose parents probably live with him (family-focused, not vanity-focused).  

His personality traits say he's helpful/unselfish (Agree) but not thorough (Strongly Disagree). So he might appreciate products that help others, but this ad is purely self-focused. No mention of family or health benefits for elders – misses his values.  

Purchase intention? He makes plans "Neutral" – not impulsive. With high income, he doesn't need cheap fixes. The ad feels shallow; he'd distrust vague claims like "helps you stay energized" without evidence (he's Neutral on trusting others). His "worry a lot" trait means he'd scrutinize this – probably thinks it's sugar-filled nonsense.  

Scoring breakdown:  
- Ad attitude: All low. "Interesting"? Maybe 2 – but no, he Disagrees he's outgoing/sociable, so flashy ads annoy him. "Attractive"? 1 – he Disagrees having few artistic interests, meaning he *does* have some, but "look your best" is still age-irrelevant.  
- Purchase intention: Hard no. He's Neutral on following plans, but this product doesn't align with his life. At 60+, he'd prefer proven health solutions, not energy drinks. "Consider buying"? Maybe 2 – but his "worry a lot" makes him avoid unverified products.  

Final scores: Ad attitude all 1-2s (dislike), purchase intention all 1s (no chance). The emotional stability claim is ironic – the ad would actually *increase* his anxiety about false promises.
