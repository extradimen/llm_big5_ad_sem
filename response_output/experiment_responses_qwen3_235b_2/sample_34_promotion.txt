Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I'm supposed to act as this specific Chinese male civil servant in his 20s-30s with a postgraduate degree, living with parents, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. The personality traits are crucial here. He's not talkative (Disagree), neutral on outgoing/sociable/reserved, Disagree on being helpful/unselfish, Agree on trusting, Strongly Disagree on being rude, Strongly Agree on thoroughness and following plans, Strongly Disagree on being careless/worrying, Strongly Agree on emotional stability, Strongly Disagree on active imagination but Strongly Agree on originality, and Disagree on having few artistic interests.

First, the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Hmm, as a civil servant, his job probably involves routine, paperwork, maybe some stress but he's emotionally stable (Strongly Agree) and doesn't worry much (Strongly Disagree). He's thorough and plans meticulously (Strongly Agree on both), so he'd value evidence-based claims. The ad is super vague—no specifics on how it works, ingredients, or proof. That would rub him the wrong way because he's detail-oriented (Strongly Agree on thorough job) and hates carelessness (Strongly Disagree on careless tendency). 

He's original and comes up with new ideas (Strongly Agree), but the ad feels generic and uninspired. It doesn't spark his creativity—hence Strongly Disagree on active imagination. Also, he's not particularly helpful/unselfish (Disagree), so he might view this as a shallow marketing ploy rather than something genuinely useful. 

He trusts people generally (Agree), but as a civil servant handling official matters, he's probably skeptical of overhyped claims. The ad lacks credibility—no data, no brand trust built. Since he's emotionally stable and doesn't get nervous easily (Neutral on nervous, Strongly Disagree on worrying), the "stay energized" angle might not resonate; he doesn't need quick fixes. "Look your best" feels superficial for someone who's original and thorough—he'd prefer substance over appearance. 

Ad attitude: 
- Like: He'd dislike the vagueness. Score 2. 
- Interesting: Not at all—it's cliché. Score 1. 
- Good: Poor execution for his standards. Score 2. 
- Attractive: Visually or conceptually unappealing to him. Score 1. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend: Zero intention without proof. Score 1. 
- Try: Unlikely—he's not careless (Strongly Disagree), so no impulse buys. Score 1. 
- Consider: Maybe if there were evidence, but as-is? Barely. Score 2 (since he's trusting, but barely). 

Also, he lives with parents—maybe family health consciousness plays a role, but the ad doesn't leverage that. His income is solid, but he's pragmatic (civil servant mindset), so he won't waste money on dubious products. 

Final scores reflect deep skepticism + mismatch with his traits.
