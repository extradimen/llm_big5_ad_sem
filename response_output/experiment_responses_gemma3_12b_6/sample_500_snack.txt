Okay, here's my evaluation of the CrunchJoy potato chip advertisement, formatted as requested. Given my profile, I'm going to be fairly critical. Iâ€™m a divorced student on a tight budget, and I tend to be reserved and a bit cynical. The "share the joy with friends" aspect doesn't particularly resonate.
