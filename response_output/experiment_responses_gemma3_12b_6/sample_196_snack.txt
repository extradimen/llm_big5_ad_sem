Okay, here's my evaluation of the CrunchJoy potato chip ad, presented in the requested JSON format. I’ll explain my reasoning after the JSON.

```json
{
  "ad_type": "snack",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 1, 2, 1],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **"I like the ad." (3/7):** It's *okay*. It's a pretty standard ad; nothing offensive, but nothing particularly appealing either. The “joy” messaging feels a bit cliché.
*   **"I think the ad is interesting." (1/7):** Not at all. It's a potato chip ad. I'm familiar with the formula – show the chips, mention they're made with potatoes, imply they're good. It doesn't offer anything new or thought-provoking.
*   **"I believe the ad is good." (2/7):** It's adequately produced, I guess. Clean visuals, clear messaging. But "good" in advertising needs to be more than just technically proficient; it needs to resonate. This doesn’t.
*   **"I find the ad attractive." (1/7):** Visually, it's unremarkable. I have my own aesthetic preferences, and this just doesn’t align with them. It looks…generic.

**Purchase Intention:**

*   **"I intend to purchase this product." (1/7):** Absolutely not. I’m a blue-collar worker with limited income. Spending money on potato chips isn’t a priority.
*   **"I will try to buy this product." (1/7):** Maybe, *maybe*, if someone offered me a bag. But I won't actively seek it out.
*   **"I will consider buying this product." (3/7):** Okay, here's where things shift slightly. The "air-fried for guilt-free snacking" is a *tiny* hook. I'm often stressed and have a tendency toward emotional instability, so the implication of less guilt *could* sway me to consider it if I had extra money, but it’s a weak influence.



**Important Note:** My being talkative and helpful doesn't inherently make me *excited* about a potato chip ad. My personality dictates a critical and honest reaction, regardless of whether I think the product itself is good.
