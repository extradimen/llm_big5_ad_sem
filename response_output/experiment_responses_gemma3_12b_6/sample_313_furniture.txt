Here's my evaluation of the "ComfyNest ergonomic chair" advertisement, reflecting my specified demographic profile and personality traits, presented in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
  "ad_type": "furniture",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 4, 3, 3],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [2, 2, 4]
}
```

**Explanation of Scores:**

*   **ad_attitude_scores:**
    *   **Like (3):** I'm not *really* thrilled by this ad. It's functional, but doesn't spark any excitement.
    *   **Interesting (4):** The concept of an ergonomic chair *is* somewhat interesting, particularly given my physically demanding job. I can appreciate the intention behind it, even if the execution is bland.
    *   **Good (3):** It's a decent ad, conveys the key features, but it's generic. I'm used to seeing this type of thing.
    *   **Attractive (3):** Not particularly visually appealing. It feels utilitarian, which isn't bad, but doesn’t grab my attention.

*   **purchase_intention_scores:**
    *   **Intend (2):** I don't feel an immediate strong desire to buy this chair. I need a *lot* of convincing. My income, while decent, has to stretch.
    *   **Try (2):** I wouldn’t actively go out of my way to seek this out.
    *   **Consider (4):** My job is physically demanding, and I *do* worry a lot about my body. The promise of all-day comfort and lumbar support is genuinely appealing. It's entered my "maybe someday" pile of things I'd consider if the price were right or if a colleague raved about it.
