Okay, let's tackle this. So, I need to act as this Chinese male student in his 40s-50s with specific traits. First, let's recap his profile. He's reserved (strongly agrees), not talkative or outgoing, neutral on being helpful, disagrees with being trusting, strongly disagrees with being rude, disagrees with doing a thorough job, strongly agrees with making plans and following through, strongly agrees with being careless, agrees with getting nervous easily, strongly disagrees with worrying a lot, strongly agrees with being emotionally stable, neutral on active imagination, strongly agrees with being original with new ideas, and neutral on artistic interests. Monthly income is over 46 million VND, which is quite high, but he's a student living with parents.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, attitude toward the ad. The questions are: like, interesting, good, attractive.

He's reserved, not sociable, so flashy ads might not appeal. He's original and comes up with new ideas, but the ad is pretty generic. "Stay energized and look your best" is vague. Since he's careless and not thorough, he might not dig into details, but he makes plans and follows through. However, he's emotionally stable and doesn't worry much, so maybe stress-related claims wouldn't resonate. But the ad is very surface-level. 

He's neutral on helpfulness, disagrees with trusting, so he might be skeptical. The ad doesn't provide evidence, so he might think it's not credible. As someone who's original, he might find the ad uncreative. Also, he's not into artistic interests, so visual appeal might not matter. But since he's reserved, loud or energetic ads might annoy him. 

So, for liking the ad: probably low. He's critical, not trusting. Maybe 2. Interesting? Generic claim, nothing new. He's original, so maybe he'd find it boring. 2. Good? Doesn't seem well-made or truthful. 2. Attractive? Visually maybe, but he's neutral on artistic, so probably not. 2.

Purchase intention: intends to buy, will try, will consider. 

He's careless, but makes plans. However, the ad lacks specifics. High income but student living with parentsâ€”maybe he's frugal? Or maybe spends on himself. But the ad doesn't convince him. He's not trusting, so skeptical of claims. Doesn't like the ad, so less likely to buy. But he's emotionally stable, so not swayed by emotional appeals. Original thinker might want innovative products, but this ad is generic. 

Intend to purchase: very low. 1. Will try: maybe if he sees it, but ad isn't persuasive. 1. Will consider: maybe a bit higher, but still skeptical. Since he's careless, might not even think about it. But he does make plans, so perhaps 2? Or 1? Hmm. Maybe 2 for consider, since he might briefly think about it but not follow through.
