Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual person described. 

First, analyzing the demographic profile: I'm a 40-49 year old Chinese male blue-collar worker with bachelor's degree, married, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. That income range suggests I'm relatively well-paid for my occupation in Vietnam, but still practical with money. As a blue-collar worker, I probably value concrete benefits over flashy promises.

Now examining personality traits carefully:
- Strongly disagree with being talkative/sociable/reserved (interesting contradiction - means I'm neither extroverted nor introverted but somewhere in between)
- Neutral on helpfulness/rudeness/carelessness/thoroughness (pragmatic, not extreme in work habits)
- Agree on trusting and planning (but neutral on following through? Hmm, maybe plans get disrupted)
- Strongly agree on nervousness/worrying (high anxiety)
- Disagree on emotional stability (confirms anxiety)
- Strongly agree on active imagination, Agree on originality (creative thinker despite blue-collar job)

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Breaking down my reaction:
As someone who worries a lot and gets nervous easily (strong traits), I'd be skeptical of vague "stay energized" claims. Blue-collar work is physically draining - I need real energy solutions, not marketing fluff. "Look your best" feels irrelevant to me - I'm 40s, married, not focused on appearance. My active imagination might make me visualize how this wouldn't work in my daily routine (e.g., "Will it really help after 10-hour factory shift?").

But I do trust people generally (Agree), so if the ad had concrete details (which it doesn't), I might believe it. However, the vagueness triggers my anxiety - I'd worry about side effects or wasting money. My planning tendency (Agree) means I research before buying, so this ad gives zero useful info.

For attitude scores:
- Like (1): Too skeptical and irrelevant
- Interesting (2): Barely, because of my imagination trait, but still weak
- Good (1): Poor execution for my needs
- Attractive (1): Visually/socially unappealing to me

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): No way without proof
- Try (2): Maybe if cheap sample, but unlikely
- Consider (3): Only if I see more evidence elsewhere

Noting that high imagination/originality makes me see through fluffy ads, while anxiety makes me avoid unproven products. Monthly income is good but I'm practical - won't waste 36M+ VND on vague promises.
