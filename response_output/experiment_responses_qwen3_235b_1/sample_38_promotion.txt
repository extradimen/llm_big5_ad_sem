Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual person described. 

First, I need to fully embody this character's profile. He's a Chinese male postgraduate student in his 20s-29s, divorced, with high income (>46M VND/month) but strongly disagrees with being sociable or helpful. Crucially, he "gets nervous easily" (strongly agree) and has other neurotic traits. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as someone who's socially withdrawn (strongly disagrees with outgoing/sociable) and unhelpful, "look your best" feels irrelevant to him. His neuroticism ("gets nervous easily") might make him skeptical of such claims. 

Breaking down attitude scores:
- Like (1): He'd dislike ads promoting social energy since he's antisocial. 
- Interesting (2): Only slightly intriguing due to high income making him aware of premium products, but "look your best" clashes with his reserved nature.
- Good (1): "Thorough job" disagreement suggests he'd spot logical flaws in vague claims.
- Attractive (1): Artistic interests are "disagreed" but not strongly, yet the ad's superficiality would repel him.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Zero alignment with his values. Divorced student with anxiety wouldn't care about "looking best."
- Try (2): Maybe out of curiosity given high income, but unlikely.
- Consider (3): Slight openness since he's "neutral" on trusting, but neuroticism makes him doubt efficacy.

Noting contradictions: High income but student status? Probably from family wealth. Still, the ad's focus on social appeal ignores his core traits. His "emotionally stable: neutral" suggests he'd rationally dismiss this as manipulative.

Final scores reflect deep misalignment: ad speaks to extroverts while he's a nervous introvert. Vague claims trigger his skepticism. Only minimal consideration due to financial capacity, not ad appeal.
