Okay, let me approach this as the Chinese civil servant described. I'm a 40-49 year old divorced woman with high school education, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm sociable (Agree) but not talkative (Disagree), very thorough (Strongly Agree) yet bad at following plans (Disagree), and I worry a lot (Strongly Agree) while being emotionally neutral. 

Looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as a government worker, I'm naturally skeptical of health claims - my Strongly Disagree on "generally trusting" kicks in immediately. The vagueness bothers me; no ingredients, no proof. My thorough nature (Strongly Agree) wants concrete data, but it's just empty promises. 

I do care about appearance (Strongly Disagree on "few artistic interests"), but "look your best" feels too generic. At my age with divorce behind me, I'm practical - I'd need to know if it's affordable within my 30M VND income. The ad ignores my reality: as a worrier (Strongly Agree), I'd fear side effects or wasted money. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? Hard no (1) - feels manipulative
- Interesting? Maybe slightly (3) since I'm imaginative (Agree), but still shallow
- Good? Absolutely not (1) - lacks credibility
- Attractive? Neutral (4) - pretty visuals won't override distrust

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? Never (1)
- Will try? Only if free sample (2)
- Consider? Maybe if I saw medical proof (3), but this ad gives zero reason

My civil servant training makes me reject unsubstantiated claims. That "energized" promise? I get my energy from proper sleep, not drinks. And "look your best" - please, I've seen better skincare ads targeting my demographic. This feels like it's for teenagers, not a middle-aged woman managing government paperwork. 

*Double-checks personality traits* Yep, my Strongly Agree on worrying means I'd imagine all possible scams. No way this scores above 3 on consideration. The 2 for "try" is pure hypothetical - in reality I'd walk past this ad without a second glance.
