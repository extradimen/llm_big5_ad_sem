Alright, let me step into the shoes of this virtual person. So, the demographic is a Chinese male in his 50s, postgraduate degree but working as a blue-collar worker. That's interesting—usually, postgrads aren't blue-collar, but maybe he switched careers or it's a skilled trade requiring advanced knowledge. His income is 26-35 million VND monthly, which is decent but not huge for someone with his education. Married, so family responsibilities might weigh on him.

Personality traits: He's talkative and strongly outgoing/sociable, which fits with being helpful and unselfish. But he's also strongly disagreeing with being generally trusting and strongly agreeing that he's sometimes rude. Hmm, that's a mix—friendly but guarded, maybe because of life experience. He worries a lot (agrees) and isn't emotionally stable (neutral), so he might be stressed. He does thorough work but doesn't follow through on plans, which is a bit contradictory. Also, he's original with ideas but not artistic. 

Now, the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, attitude toward the ad. As a sociable, talkative guy, he might engage with ads, but he's not trusting and worries a lot. So he's probably skeptical. The ad is vague—no specifics on how it works, ingredients, or proof. For someone who does thorough work, that lack of detail would bother him. He's also rude sometimes, so he might dismiss it as "typical marketing fluff." 

- Like the ad? He might find it unappealing because it feels manipulative. Score low, maybe 2. 
- Interesting? Possibly, since he's sociable, but the vagueness makes it boring. Neutral-low, 3. 
- Believes it's good? Unlikely—he's critical and thorough. He'd want evidence. Score 2. 
- Attractive? The claim is shallow; as a blue-collar worker, he might prioritize substance over "looking your best." Score 2. 

Purchase intention: Even if he liked the ad, he's not trusting and worries about scams. Plus, as a blue-collar worker with family, he's practical. He'd need proof it works, not just promises. 

- Intend to purchase? Hard no. Score 1. 
- Will try to buy? Maybe out of curiosity, but his thoroughness means he'd research first. Still low, 2. 
- Will consider? Only if there's credible info, but the ad gives none. So 3—slightly above neutral because he's open-minded (original ideas), but barely. 

Wait, his income is solid, but he's cautious. No impulse buys. And "look your best" might not resonate—a 50s blue-collar guy probably cares more about function (energy for work) than appearance. The ad misses his actual need: sustained energy for physical labor, not vanity. 

Also, he's married, so family health matters. But the ad doesn't mention safety or ingredients, which would worry him (he worries a lot). 

Double-checking scores: 
Ad attitude: all low because of skepticism. Purchase: all very low, but "consider" slightly higher since he's not closed-minded. 

Final scores make sense. He'd reject this ad as superficial.
