Okay, let's tackle this step by step. So, I need to evaluate this ad from the perspective of a 40-49 year old Chinese male blue-collar worker with specific personality traits. First, I'll recap his profile to make sure I get it right.

He's a Chinese male, 40-49, high school education, blue-collar worker, living with parents, income over 46 million VND monthly. His personality traits: strongly agrees he's talkative, neutral on outgoing/sociable and reserved, agrees he's helpful/unselfish, disagrees with being generally trusting, strongly disagrees with being rude, strongly disagrees with doing a thorough job, disagrees with making plans and being careless, disagrees with getting nervous easily, strongly agrees he worries a lot, agrees he's emotionally stable, strongly disagrees with having an active imagination and being original, and strongly agrees he has few artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

Now, breaking down the attitude toward the ad first. The questions are: like, interesting, good, attractive.

Given his traits. He's talkative (strongly agree), so maybe he engages with ads more, but he's not trusting (disagrees with generally trusting). Also, he worries a lot (strongly agree), so he might be skeptical. He's not into artistic or imaginative stuff (strongly disagrees), so ads that are flashy or creative might not appeal. He does a thorough job? Strongly disagrees, so maybe he doesn't pay much attention to details in ads. Also, he's emotionally stable (agrees), but worries a lot—maybe that's a contradiction, but perhaps he manages worries without getting overwhelmed.

The ad is pretty generic: "stay energized and look your best." As a blue-collar worker, staying energized might be relevant because his job is physical. But "look your best" might not resonate as much since he has few artistic interests and isn't into aesthetics. He's not original or imaginative, so maybe he prefers straightforward, practical messages.

But he's not trusting. So he might doubt the claim. "Helps you stay energized"—maybe he's heard that before, and since he worries a lot, he might think it's too good to be true. Also, he strongly disagrees with doing a thorough job, so he might not research if the product works, but his lack of trust could make him dismiss the ad quickly.

Now, scoring each attitude:

1. I like the ad. Hmm. He's talkative, so maybe he talks about ads, but the ad is vague. Since he's not trusting and worries a lot, he might not like it. Probably low score. Maybe 2 or 3.

2. Interesting? The ad is very generic. He has few artistic interests and no active imagination, so probably not interesting. Strongly disagree would be 1, but maybe 2.

3. Believe the ad is good. "Good" here might mean well-made or effective. But he's not trusting, so he might not think it's credible. Also, he doesn't do thorough jobs, so maybe doesn't care, but his worry makes him skeptical. Maybe 2.

4. Find the ad attractive. Attractive could mean visually or appealingly presented. But he has few artistic interests, so visuals might not matter. The message isn't tailored to him. Probably low. Maybe 2.

Now purchase intention: intend, try, consider.

He's a blue-collar worker with decent income (>46M VND/month, which is actually quite high in Vietnam—maybe equivalent to $1900, which is good for blue-collar). But he lives with parents, so maybe not spending much on himself.

The product is a drink for energy and looks. As a physical worker, energy might be a need. But he's not trusting, so even if he needs energy, he might not believe the ad. He worries a lot, so he might doubt effectiveness.

But purchase intention: even if he doesn't like the ad, he might consider buying if it solves a problem. However, the ad doesn't specify how it's different. "Stay energized" is common in energy drinks. But "look your best" might not matter to him (few artistic interests).

He strongly disagrees with doing thorough jobs, so he might not seek out products, but if he sees it, maybe impulse buy? But he's not impulsive—disagrees with making plans, but that's about following through. Wait, he disagrees with "make plans and follow through," so maybe he's not organized, but that doesn't mean impulsive.

His purchase intention might be low because of distrust. Worrying a lot could make him hesitant to try new products.

Scores:

1. Intend to purchase: Probably low. 1 or 2.

2. Will try to buy: Maybe slightly higher if he's curious, but distrust might block it. 2.

3. Will consider: Even if not intending now, might think about it. But since he doesn't do thorough jobs, maybe not. However, "consider" is a lower bar. Maybe 3? But his worry might make him dismiss it. Hmm.

Wait, his income is high, so affordability isn't an issue. But the ad doesn't resonate. He's helpful/unselfish, but the product is for himself. Not sure if that affects.

Also, he's emotionally stable, so maybe not swayed by emotional appeals. The ad's "look your best" might be superficial to him.

Putting it all together.

Ad attitude scores: All low because of skepticism, lack of trust, and the ad not addressing his practical needs in a believable way. Maybe 2,2,2,2.

But let's see. Maybe "interesting" could be a 3 if he's talkative—he might find it something to chat about, but the ad is so generic, probably not. He's neutral on outgoing, so maybe not.

Purchase intention: Even if ad is unappealing, he might consider buying for energy. But since he worries a lot, he might think it's a scam. So intend:1, try:2, consider:2.

Wait, but consider is "will consider buying." Even skeptical people might consider, but his strong disagreement with trust might make him not consider. However, "consider" is a low threshold. Maybe 3 for consider?

But given his traits: disagrees with trusting, strongly agrees with worrying a lot. So he's likely to dismiss it. So consider might be 2.

Let me check similar scenarios. If someone doesn't trust an ad, they probably won't consider the product. Unless there's a strong need. As a blue-collar worker, energy drinks might be relevant, but there are many brands. This ad doesn't stand out.

So purchase intention scores: 1,1,2? Or 1,2,2.

Hmm. Let's think of real-life. A worker sees an ad for an energy drink. If he drinks such products already, he might not switch for a vague ad. If he doesn't, he might be skeptical. Given his high income, he can afford it, but the ad doesn't convince him.

Perhaps "consider" is 3 because even if skeptical, he might think "maybe I'll check it out," but his trait of not doing thorough jobs might mean he won't bother. So maybe 2 for consider.

Final scores:

Ad attitude: all 2s? Or maybe "good" is 1? But the scale is 1-7, 1 strongly disagree, 7 strongly agree.

Wait, the questions are statements where 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree.

So for "I like the ad." If he dislikes it, score 1 or 2.

Given his distrust and worry, he probably dislikes it. So 2 (disagree).

Similarly, interesting: 2.

Believe ad is good: 2.

Attractive: 2.

Purchase intention:

Intend to purchase: 1 (strongly disagree)

Will try: 1 or 2. Maybe 1.

Consider: 2.

But let's see examples. If the ad doesn't resonate, purchase intention is low.

Another angle: He's talkative, so maybe he discusses ads, but that doesn't mean he likes them. His neutrality on outgoing might mean he's not particularly social.

Also, he's helpful/unselfish, but the product is for self-use, so maybe not relevant.

I think ad scores are all around 2. Purchase intention 1,1,2.

Wait, the instruction says "You may like the ad but still not want to buy the product." But in this case, he probably doesn't like the ad either.

So ad attitude scores: [2,2,2,2]

Purchase: [1,1,2]

But let's confirm. Is there any trait that might make him like the ad? Talkative—maybe he appreciates ads he can talk about, but this ad is too generic. Not really. He's not into artistic, so no.

Worries a lot—makes him skeptical. Not trusting—same.

So yes, low ad scores.

Purchase intention: since he doesn't trust the ad, he won't intend or try, but might consider if he sees it in store. But "consider" is a maybe. Given his worry, even consideration is low. But "consider" is lower threshold. Maybe 2.

Yes.
