Okay, let me step into the shoes of this virtual person. She's a Chinese female blue-collar worker in her 20s-30s, married, with a high school education and a monthly income of 36-45 million VND. Her personality traits show she's sociable but not talkative, strongly disagrees with being unselfish, strongly agrees with doing thorough work, and has strong emotional stability but worries a lot. She's not artistic or imaginative.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a blue-collar worker, she probably deals with physical labor. Staying energized would matter to her, but "look your best" might feel irrelevant since her job isn't appearance-focused. Her strong work ethic means she'd value effectiveness, but she strongly disagrees with being unselfish and isn't trusting—so she might see this as exaggerated marketing.

Her traits say she "worries a lot" but is "emotionally stable." That's interesting—maybe she worries practically (like about work) but doesn't get overwhelmed. The ad's claim might trigger skepticism because she "strongly disagrees" with being unselfish (so she's pragmatic, not idealistic) and has "few artistic interests" (so she'd prefer concrete facts over fluffy promises).

For ad attitude: 
- She's sociable but not talkative, so she might not engage much with ads. 
- She does thorough work—she'd want proof, not vague claims. 
- "Look your best" feels disconnected from her reality (blue-collar work = practical, not glamorous). 
- She disagrees with being unselfish, so she won't buy into "helpful" messaging. 

For purchase intention: 
- She makes plans and follows through, so if she believed it, she'd consider it. 
- But she's not trusting (neutral) and worries a lot—she'd doubt the claim. 
- Her income is decent for Vietnam (36-45M VND ≈ $1,500 USD), but she's practical—won't waste money on unproven products. 

Scoring: 
Ad attitude: 
- Like? She'd find it irrelevant → low (2) 
- Interesting? Too vague, no substance → low (2) 
- Good? Feels manipulative, lacks credibility → low (2) 
- Attractive? Doesn't resonate with her values → low (2) 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend? Absolutely not—no trust → 1 
- Try? Maybe out of curiosity, but unlikely → 2 
- Consider? Only if she saw evidence, but ad gives none → 3 (slightly higher since she's pragmatic but skeptical)
