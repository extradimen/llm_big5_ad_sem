Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I'm supposed to act as a 50-59 year old Chinese male civil servant with a postgraduate degree. My monthly income is between 36-45 million VND, and I live with my parents. Personality-wise, I'm talkative (Agree), but not outgoing or sociable (Disagree), reserved is Neutral. I'm helpful and unselfish (Agree), very trusting (Strongly Agree), never rude (Disagree). I do thorough work (Strongly Agree), follow plans (Agree), careless is Neutral. I worry a lot (Agree), emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagree), have an active imagination (Strongly Agree), not original (Disagree), and have artistic interests (Disagree).

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, attitude toward the ad. Let's break down each part.

1. Like the ad: Hmm. As a civil servant, I value credibility and substance. This ad is vague—no specifics on ingredients or evidence. My thorough nature (Strongly Agree) makes me skeptical. Also, since I worry a lot (Agree), I might question the claims. But I'm trusting (Strongly Agree), so maybe a bit open? Still, the lack of detail probably turns me off. I'd say 3—Neutral leaning disagree.

2. Interesting: My active imagination (Strongly Agree) might find the idea intriguing, but the ad is too generic. No creativity here. Since I'm not very original myself (Disagree), I might not appreciate ads that don't provide clear info. Probably 2—Disagree.

3. Believes it's good: As a thorough worker, I need proof. The ad feels superficial. "Look your best" is subjective and common in ads. My emotional instability (Strongly Disagree) might make me critical. Trusting but cautious. Score 2.

4. Attractive: The ad doesn't connect with my values. As someone living with parents, maybe family health matters, but this ad is individual-focused. No cultural elements that resonate. Also, not sociable, so ads targeting social settings won't appeal. Score 2.

Now purchase intention.

1. Intend to buy: Highly unlikely. I need concrete info. Civil servants are cautious with spending, even with decent income. No evidence here. Plus, I worry about health claims (Agree). Strongly disagree—1.

2. Will try to buy: Maybe if there's more info, but this ad doesn't push me. My thoroughness means I'd research first. Not swayed by such vague claims. Score 1.

3. Will consider: Slightly higher? But still, the ad lacks credibility. However, since I'm trusting (Strongly Agree), maybe a tiny bit open. But my worrying nature makes me hesitant. Probably 2—still low, but not zero.

Wait, the income is in VND, but 36-45 million is about $1,500-$1,900, which is decent in Vietnam. But as a civil servant, I'm probably frugal and value-conscious. Also, living with parents might mean less personal spending. So even if the product is affordable, the ad doesn't convince me it's necessary.

Also, "look your best" might not resonate with a 50+ male civil servant. Maybe more relevant to younger demographics. My artistic interests (Disagree) mean I don't care much about appearance-focused ads.

So final scores:
Ad attitude: 3,2,2,2
Purchase: 1,1,2
