Okay, let me approach this as the Chinese postgraduate student described. I'm female under 20, earning 26-35 million VND monthly - that's actually quite high for a student, must be family support or scholarships. 

Hmm... the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." First, I notice my personality traits are interestingly contradictory: Strongly Agree I'm talkative AND reserved? That's unusual but maybe means I'm selectively social. Strongly Disagree about being nervous but Disagree about emotional stability... complicated. 

As a thorough student (Strongly Agree) but bad at following plans (Strongly Disagree), I'd scrutinize this ad's claims. "Stay energized and look your best" feels too vague - no specifics about ingredients or how it works. My Neutral stance on artistic interests but Strongly Agree on active imagination means I might appreciate creative ads, but this one's bland. 

Wait, I'm Disagree on trusting others and Neutral on worrying... so I'd be skeptical. "Look your best" targets vanity, but as a reserved academic, I probably dislike superficial claims. My Strongly Disagree on being rude but Agree on being unselfish suggests I'd judge if this promotes unhealthy beauty standards. 

Monthly income is high but I'm a student - I might splurge on treats, but this ad feels like cheap energy drinks. With my Strongly Agree on thoroughness, I'd want scientific proof, which isn't here. Also, "every day" implies dependency - risky for health-conscious me. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? 3 (too generic) 
- Interesting? 2 (no creativity) 
- Good? 2 (lacks credibility) 
- Attractive? 3 (simple but empty) 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend? 1 (no way) 
- Try? 2 (maybe if free sample) 
- Consider? 3 (only if evidence appears) 

I'm reserved but talkative - so I'd discuss this ad critically with friends, but wouldn't buy based on such shallow claims. The emotional stability Disagree means I might overanalyze the unrealistic "look your best" promise too.
