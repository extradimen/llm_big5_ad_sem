Okay, let's see. I need to evaluate this ad based on the demographic and personality traits provided. The user is a Chinese male over 60, with a postgraduate degree, working as a managerial employee, married, high income. His personality traits: he's reserved, outgoing/sociable (Agree), but talkative (Disagree). Strongly Agree on being helpful and unselfish, Strongly Disagree on trusting others. He's thorough (Agree), not careless (Strongly Disagree), emotionally stable (Strongly Agree). 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, attitude toward the ad. He's reserved but sociable. Maybe he values substance over hype. He's not trusting (Strongly Disagree), so he might be skeptical of such claims. The ad is vague—no specifics on how it works, ingredients, etc. As a thorough person (Agree), he'd want more details. Also, he's over 60; maybe he's health-conscious but wary of products making broad claims. Since he's emotionally stable, he might not be swayed by emotional appeals. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like: He might not like it because it's too generic and lacks credibility. Maybe a 2.
- Interesting: Probably not, since it's vague. He's not into active imagination (Disagree), so unlikely to find it intriguing. Score 2.
- Good: As a thorough person, he'd think it's a poor ad for not providing evidence. Score 1.
- Attractive: Doesn't specify visuals, but given his traits, he might find it unattractive due to lack of substance. Score 2.

Purchase intention:
- Intend to purchase: He's untrusting and thorough. Without proof, he won't intend to buy. Score 1.
- Try to buy: Maybe slightly higher if he's curious, but his strong distrust suggests no. Score 1.
- Consider buying: As a thorough person, he might consider if there's more info, but the ad alone isn't enough. Still, since he's unselfish, maybe he'd look into it for family? But the ad is for personal use. Probably still low. Score 2.

Wait, he's helpful/unselfish, but the ad is about personal benefit. Doesn't align. His high income means he can afford it, but distrust is key here. Also, age >60 might mean he's cautious about new products, especially drinks making energy claims—could be wary of stimulants or sugar content. 

Double-checking: Strongly Disagree on trusting, so any ad making claims without proof would be dismissed. The ad gives no evidence, so all scores should be low. Purchase intention especially low. 

So ad attitude: 1,2,1,2? Wait, the scale is 1-7 where 1 is strongly disagree. For "I like the ad" as a statement, if he dislikes it, score 1. Similarly for others. 

Final scores:
Ad attitude: like=1, interesting=2, good=1, attractive=2
Purchase: intend=1, try=1, consider=2
