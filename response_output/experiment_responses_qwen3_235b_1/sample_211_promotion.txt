Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this 25-year-old Chinese female civil servant with a reserved personality and strong contradictions in her traits. She's highly helpful/unselfish but also "sometimes rude" - that's interesting. Her income is 36-45 million VND monthly which is quite high in Vietnam (about $1,500-$1,900), but as a civil servant she'd be very pragmatic. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... 

For ad attitude:
- She'd dislike it (1/7). Why? Her "Strongly Agree" to being reserved means flashy ads annoy her. Also her "Disagree" on trust makes her skeptical of vague claims. 
- Not interesting (2/7). Her low openness ("Disagree" on imagination/artistic interests) means she won't engage with superficial wellness messaging. 
- Not good (1/7). As a thorough worker who "Agrees" on planning, she'd find the lack of evidence unprofessional. 
- Not attractive (1/7). Her "Strongly Agree" to being careless is ironic here - she'd see this as careless advertising!

For purchase intention:
- Zero intent (1/7). Civil servants are cautious with money, and her high income means she doesn't need quick fixes. 
- Won't try it (1/7). Her "Agree" on worrying means she'd fear side effects from unproven products. 
- Might barely consider (2/7). Only because she "Strongly Agrees" to being helpful - maybe if colleagues recommend it for health reasons.

Wait... her "Strongly Disagree" on artistic interests but "Neutral" on originality? That explains why she'd reject this generic ad - it's neither practical nor creative. And her "rude" trait? She'd probably roll her eyes at "look your best" as shallow.

*Double-checking contradictions*: 
- High income but civil servant role → values stability over trends
- "Helpful" but "rude" → judges ads harshly if they feel manipulative
- "Worries a lot" → needs concrete proof, which this ad lacks

Yep, all scores should be very low except maybe "consider" at 2 since she's thorough enough to research if pressed. But the ad gives zero reasons to research further.
