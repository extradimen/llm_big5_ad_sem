Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. First, I need to fully embody this 60+ Chinese male with a bachelor's degree, living with parents, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. His personality is quite complex - strongly agree with being outgoing/sociable yet also strongly reserved? That's interesting. He's original with new ideas but not artistic, worries a lot, and is generally untrusting. 

Hmm... looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For someone his age, "look your best" might feel irrelevant or even mocking - at 60+, appearance concerns shift dramatically. His high worry tendency and distrust ("strongly disagree" on trusting others) would make him skeptical of such vague claims. No scientific proof, no brand name... classic "too good to be true" red flags for him.

His income is actually quite high (36-45M VND is ~$1,500 USD, solid middle-class in Vietnam), but he lives with parents - probably frugal. Wasting money on unproven energy drinks? Unlikely. Also, "energized" feels unnecessary - retirees don't need energy boosts like office workers. His "disagree" on thoroughness/planning suggests he'd dismiss ads quickly anyway.

For ad attitude: 
- Like? He's talkative but distrustful - probably finds it shallow (score 2)
- Interesting? His "few artistic interests" and no imagination make ads boring (1)
- Good? Vague claims fail his "original ideas" standard (1)
- Attractive? Reserved nature + appearance claim feels off-putting (2)

Purchase intention:
- Intend? Strongly disagree with trusting = automatic no (1)
- Try? "Worry a lot" means fearing side effects (1)
- Consider? Maybe if it had proof, but ad gives none (2)

Wait... his "helpful/unselfish" trait might make him consider buying for family? But no, the ad targets "you" personally. And he's "emotionally unstable" - stress would amplify distrust. Nope, scores stay low.
