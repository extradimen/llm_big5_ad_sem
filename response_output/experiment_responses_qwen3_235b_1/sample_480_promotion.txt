Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual persona described. 

First, considering the demographic profile: a 60+ Chinese female student with bachelor's degree, married, high income (26-35M VND/month). Interesting contradiction here - "student" at >60 suggests possibly lifelong learner or returning to education, which aligns with bachelor's degree. High income for Vietnam context implies financial security.

Now personality traits analysis:
- Strongly Agree with "outgoing/sociable" and "helpful/unselfish" → values community, enjoys social interaction
- Disagree with "generally trusting" → skeptical nature
- Strongly Disagree with "rude" → maintains politeness
- Disagree with "thorough job"/"follow through plans" → likely spontaneous, not detail-oriented
- Strongly Disagree with "nervous easily" but Agree with "worry a lot" → interesting paradox: outwardly calm but internally anxious
- Disagree with "original ideas", Agree with "few artistic interests" → practical mindset

The ad claims: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

Breaking down my reaction:
As a sociable person who worries a lot, I'd question how "energized" connects to social needs - maybe for keeping up with activities? But "look your best" feels superficial for my age group. At >60, "looking best" might imply anti-aging, but I have few artistic interests so appearance isn't priority. 

Key concerns:
1) Skepticism: Disagree with "generally trusting" → immediate doubt about "helps you stay energized" claim. No evidence shown.
2) Practicality: Disagree with thoroughness → won't research validity, but my worry tendency makes me suspicious.
3) Values mismatch: As helpful/unselfish person, I prioritize others' needs over personal "looking best". 
4) Energy need: As active socializer, might want energy boost, but "drink" solution feels gimmicky.

Purchase intention factors:
- High income means affordability isn't issue
- But Disagree with "follow through plans" → unlikely to commit to regular purchase
- Strongly Disagree with "rude" but Disagree with thoroughness → might impulse-buy then abandon

Scoring rationale:
Ad attitude:
- Like (1): Too superficial for my values
- Interesting (2): Mild curiosity as social person, but low
- Good (1): Feels manipulative given my skepticism
- Attractive (1): "Look your best" irrelevant to my age/practicality

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): No commitment tendency
- Try (2): Might sample due to sociability (e.g. if offered at community event)
- Consider (3): Worry tendency makes me overthink it, but low priority

Noting: Could "energized" help with student activities? But as Disagree with thoroughness, I wouldn't connect this to academic needs. The ad fails to bridge product to my actual lifestyle.
