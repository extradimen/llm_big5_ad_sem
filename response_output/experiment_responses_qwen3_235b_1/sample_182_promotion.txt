Okay, let's tackle this step by step. So, I need to evaluate this ad from the perspective of a Chinese woman over 60, a civil servant with a bachelor's degree, single, high income, and specific personality traits. The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

First, looking at her demographic: She's a senior civil servant in China, so probably values professionalism and might be skeptical of flashy claims. Her high income means she's not desperate for cheap solutions, and her education suggests she's analytical. Personality-wise, she's strongly disagree on talkative and reserved, so she's outgoing but not necessarily chatty. She strongly disagrees on being helpful/unselfish and trusting, which is interesting—it suggests she's pragmatic, maybe even a bit guarded. She agrees she worries a lot and is original with new ideas, but has few artistic interests.

The ad is very generic: "stay energized and look your best." For someone who's skeptical (strongly disagrees on trusting) and worries a lot, this might come off as too vague or even suspicious. She's a civil servant—probably used to precise language, so "helps you stay energized" sounds like a weak claim without evidence. Also, "look your best" might feel shallow to her since she has few artistic interests and isn't into imagination/originality in that sense (though she does agree on being original with ideas, but in a practical way, maybe?). 

Her personality: Strongly disagrees on being helpful/unselfish, so she might not care about ads that imply communal benefits. Neutral on being rude, so she might bluntly think the ad is insincere. She agrees she's careless sometimes, but also makes plans—so she might dismiss this as not thorough enough. And she worries a lot, so an ad promising effortless energy/beauty might trigger skepticism: "Is this safe? What's the catch?"

Attitude toward ad: 
- Like it? Probably not. She's critical (strongly disagrees on trusting), so 1 or 2. 
- Interesting? Maybe neutral if it sparks a thought, but she has few artistic interests and isn't imaginative, so likely low. 
- Good? As a civil servant, she'd judge quality—vague claims = bad ad. 
- Attractive? She's outgoing but not superficial; "look your best" might not resonate. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? High income but skeptical—she won't buy based on fluff. 
- Will try? Unlikely; she worries a lot and isn't trusting. 
- Consider? Maybe a tiny bit if she's original with ideas (could think "hmm, maybe for a specific need?"), but still low. 

Scores: 
Ad attitude: All low. Like=1, interesting=2 (slightly higher because she's outgoing/sociable but still critical), good=1, attractive=1. 
Purchase: All very low. Intend=1, try=1, consider=2 (just a hair above because she agrees on being original—might *consider* if there's proof, but ad gives none).
