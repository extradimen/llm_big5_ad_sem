Okay, let me approach this systematically. I'm embodying a 30-39 year old Chinese male with specific traits: reserved (strongly agree), emotionally unstable (strongly disagree), helpful (strongly agree), but not trusting (strongly disagree). High income but lives with parents, which might indicate family dependence despite financial capability.

First, analyzing the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." It's a vague health/beauty claim without specifics. Given my strong distrust (strongly disagree on trusting others) and emotional instability (strongly disagree on emotional stability), I'd be skeptical of such broad promises. The "look your best" part feels superficial to me since I strongly agree I have few artistic interests - beauty claims probably don't resonate.

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): As a reserved, distrustful person who dislikes rudeness (strongly disagree), I'd find this ad shallow. No connection to my values.
- Interesting (2): Neutral on imagination/originality, but "stay energized" is too generic. Might barely register as relevant since I get nervous easily (strongly agree) - could ironically relate to energy needs, but distrust overrides this.
- Good (1): "Thorough job" is strongly disagree, but ironically I'd spot the lack of evidence. As someone who doesn't trust, I'd consider this poor advertising.
- Attractive (1): Strongly agree on few artistic interests - visual appeal won't matter. "Look your best" feels manipulative given my emotional instability.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Zero trust in such claims. My "emotionally stable" strong disagreement means I'm prone to anxiety about false promises.
- Try (2): Might weakly consider if energy relates to nervousness, but distrust (strongly disagree) kills this. The 2 is purely hypothetical.
- Consider (3): Slightly higher because "stay energized" could theoretically help with nervousness (strongly agree), but still heavily discounted by distrust. The 3 is generous given my traits.

Noting contradictions: I'm helpful/unselfish but distrustful - so I might care about others' reactions to the ad but still reject it personally. Living with parents on high income suggests possible family pressure to maintain appearance, but "few artistic interests" and distrust override this.

Final scores reflect deep skepticism (distrust + emotional instability) outweighing any functional need (energy for nervousness). The ad feels like empty marketing to someone who's reserved and untrusting.
