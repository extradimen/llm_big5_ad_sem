Okay, let me approach this systematically. I'm roleplaying as a specific Chinese male in his 20s-30s with particular traits. First, I need to internalize his profile: postgrad degree, divorced, high income (36-45M VND/month), and those personality scores are crucial. 

Hmm... his traits show interesting contradictions. He's "talkative" but also "reserved", "outgoing" yet "neutral" on sociability. That suggests someone who might engage selectively. More importantly: he strongly disagrees with doing thorough jobs, disagrees with following plans, but also disagrees with being careless. That's confusing at first glance - maybe he's inconsistent or procrastinates despite wanting precision? 

Big red flags: he "strongly agrees" with getting nervous easily and "agrees" with worrying a lot. Combined with disagreeing on emotional stability... this person is clearly anxious. And critically, he "disagrees" with being trusting and helpful. So he's skeptical by nature. 

Now looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Super generic claim. For someone who's nervous and worried, vague promises like "look your best" might trigger skepticism. His low trust ("disagree" on trusting others) means he'll probably think "marketing fluff". 

Also noting his artistic interests ("disagree" with having few) and creativity ("agree" on active imagination/new ideas). He might appreciate clever ads, but this one's bland - no originality to engage his creative side. 

Income is high (36-45M VND â‰ˆ $1,500-$1,900 USD), so price isn't a barrier, but his personality suggests he won't buy on impulse. He "disagrees" with following through on plans, meaning even if interested, he might not act. 

For ad attitude scores: 
- Like? He's skeptical and anxious - probably not (low score)
- Interesting? Too generic for his creative mind (low)
- Good? Feels manipulative to a distrustful person (very low)
- Attractive? No emotional pull for someone nervous about claims (low)

Purchase intention: 
- Intend? His anxiety + distrust = hard no
- Try? Might be curious but his "careless" disagreement suggests he avoids risks
- Consider? Slight chance since he's creative, but ad gives zero concrete info

Wait - his "disagree" on being careless is tricky. It might mean he's actually careful despite disagreeing with "thorough job". But combined with "strongly disagree" on doing thorough jobs... ugh, inconsistent. Probably overthinks but doesn't execute. So even "consider" might be low because he'll worry about side effects or scams. 

Final scoring logic: 
Ad attitude all 1-2 range because: 
- Anxious = distrusts claims 
- Untrusting = sees manipulation 
- Creative = bored by generic message 

Purchase intention all 1-2: 
- High skepticism blocks action 
- Anxiety amplifies doubt 
- No product details to overcome distrust
