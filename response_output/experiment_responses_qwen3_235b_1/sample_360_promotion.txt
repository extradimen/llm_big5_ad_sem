Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. 

First, I need to fully embody this Chinese male manager in his 30s. He's divorced, makes decent money but not super wealthy (16-25m VND/month), only high school educated. Personality-wise, he's quiet (reserved/agree), unselfish (strongly agree), but distrustful (strongly disagree on trusting) and emotionally unstable (strongly disagree on stable). Interesting contradictions here - helpful but sometimes rude, creative but not thorough. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As someone who's emotionally unstable but doesn't worry much (wait no - he strongly disagrees with worrying a lot but agrees with getting nervous easily? That's tricky), he'd probably be skeptical. His distrust trait (strongly disagree on trusting) jumps out - he'd see this as typical empty marketing claims. 

Also noting he's reserved and not sociable (strongly disagree on outgoing). Ads promising to "look your best" might feel superficial to him. His artistic interests are limited (agree) but he's original (strongly agree) - so he might appreciate creativity but this ad seems generic. 

For attitude scores:
- Like? Probably not. He'd find it clich√©. Maybe 2.
- Interesting? His imagination is active (agree) but the claim is too vague. 3.
- Good? With his distrust, he'd think it's misleading. 2.
- Attractive? He's not superficial (limited artistic interests). 2.

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? No way with his skepticism. 1.
- Will try? Maybe out of curiosity but unlikely. 2.
- Will consider? Only if he sees proof, which this ad lacks. 3.

Wait - his "emotionally stable" is strongly disagree, meaning he's unstable. But "worry a lot" is strongly disagree... so he gets nervous easily but doesn't dwell on worries? That's confusing. Maybe he has sudden anxiety but moves on quickly. Still, the ad's promise feels too good to be true for someone distrustful. 

Also as a managerial employee with only high school education, he might prefer practical, evidence-based claims over fluffy promises. The ad gives zero specifics - no ingredients, no proof. His "do a thorough job" is disagree, but he "makes plans" (agree) - so he might research first rather than trust ads. 

Final thought: The ad feels like cheap hype to him. Scores should reflect deep skepticism while acknowledging slight openness to "consider" if evidence appears.
