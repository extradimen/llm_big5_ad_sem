Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I'm supposed to be a 20-29 year old Chinese male, divorced, with a high school education working as a managerial employee earning 36-45 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, I'm talkative (Agree), reserved (Agree), not helpful/unselfish (Disagree), extremely trusting (Strongly Agree), never rude (Strongly Disagree), thorough (Agree), bad at following plans (Disagree), careless (Agree), emotionally stable (Agree), very imaginative and original (Strongly Agree), and neutral on artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, attitude toward the ad. Let's break down each part. 

1. **I like the ad.** Hmm. As someone who's talkative but also reserved, I might appreciate ads that aren't too flashy. But this ad is super generic. "Stay energized and look your best" – sounds like every other energy drink ad out there. I'm original and come up with new ideas, so I probably find this cliché. Plus, I'm thorough but careless, so I might notice the lack of specifics. Since I'm extremely trusting, maybe I'd give it some credit, but the ad feels shallow. Probably not a fan. Score around 3 or 4? Wait, but the instruction says to be critical. I think I'd dislike it because it's unoriginal. Maybe 2?

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** With an active imagination and being original, I'd expect something creative. This ad is bland. No story, no unique angle. Just a plain claim. Definitely not interesting. Strongly disagree. So 1.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** "Good" as in well-made? It's probably professionally done but lacks substance. Since I do a thorough job myself, I'd notice the vagueness. No evidence, no details. Not good. Maybe 2.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** Attractive visually? The description doesn't mention visuals, but the message itself isn't appealing. As someone who's emotionally stable and not worried, I don't need "look your best" pressure. Also, divorced, so maybe not focused on appearance in that way. Plus, careless tendency might make me dismiss it quickly. Not attractive. 2.

Now purchase intention. 

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** Even if I trusted the ad (which I do, since Strongly Agree on trusting), the ad doesn't give reasons to buy. No specifics on how it works, ingredients, etc. I'm thorough but careless – might skip details, but the ad provides none. Also, as a managerial employee with decent income, I might be skeptical of vague claims. No intention. 1.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** Similar to above. Without convincing info, why would I seek it out? I make plans but don't follow through (Disagree on following plans), so even if I thought about it, I wouldn't act. 1.

3. **I will consider buying it.** Maybe? But the ad is so generic. Since I'm original, I might look for innovative products, but this ad doesn't highlight innovation. Also, not helpful/unselfish – I'm focused on my own needs, but the ad doesn't address what's in it for me beyond vague benefits. Probably not. But since I'm trusting, maybe a tiny bit? But the ad lacks credibility. Neutral at best? Wait, the scale is 1-7. Considering it would be a 2 or 3. But given the criticism, likely 2.
