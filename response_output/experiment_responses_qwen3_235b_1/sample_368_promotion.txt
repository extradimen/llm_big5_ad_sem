Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual person described. 

First, I need to fully embody this 20-29 year old Chinese female civil servant with high school education. Her profile shows strong contradictions: she's reserved (Strongly Agree) but emotionally stable (Strongly Agree), unhelpful/unselfish (Strongly Disagree), and distrustful (Strongly Disagree). The income range (16-25M VND) suggests modest means for a civil servant in Vietnam, and living with parents indicates traditional family structure.

Looking at the ad "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day" - I need to evaluate through her lens. Her personality traits are crucial here:
- Reserved nature means flashy ads would annoy her
- Strong distrust makes health/beauty claims suspicious
- Emotional stability but high nervousness creates tension
- "Unhelpful/unselfish" trait suggests zero interest in altruistic messaging
- Low artistic interest means visual appeal won't matter

For ad attitude scores:
1. "I like the ad" - She'd find it shallow. Her distrust and reserve make this generic claim unappealing. Score: 1 (Strongly Disagree)
2. "Interesting" - With few artistic interests and no imagination, she won't engage. Score: 2 (Disagree)
3. "Good ad" - Contradicts her thoroughness (Neutral) - the claim feels unsubstantiated. Score: 1
4. "Attractive" - Her artistic disinterest and distrust make visual appeal irrelevant. Score: 1

Purchase intention is even lower:
- Her income is tight (max 25M VND/month â‰ˆ $1k), so energy drinks are non-essential
- "Helps look your best" clashes with her "unselfish" trait - she doesn't care about appearance-focused claims
- Strong distrust means she'd assume it's sugary junk
- "Make plans and follow through" is Strongly Disagreed - she doesn't plan purchases

Thus:
1. "Intend to purchase" - Absolutely not. Score: 1
2. "Will try" - Her nervousness might make her avoid unknown products. Score: 1
3. "Consider" - Only Neutral at best, but her distrust pushes it lower. Score: 2

Final check: All scores reflect her skepticism, financial reality, and personality contradictions. The 1s aren't exaggerated - for someone who's "rarely trusting" and "unselfish", a beauty/energy ad is fundamentally alien.
