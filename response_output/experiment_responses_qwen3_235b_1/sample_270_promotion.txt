Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this 50-59 year old Chinese male student with a bachelor's degree. Interesting profile - male student in that age bracket suggests he's pursuing further education later in life, probably while working given his high income (26-35 million VND/month is quite substantial in Vietnam). His personality traits show strong conscientiousness (thorough job, follows plans) but also high anxiety (worries a lot). Key contradictions: outgoing/sociable yet single, creative but unartistic, trusting but worries excessively.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as a detail-oriented person who "makes plans and follows through", he'd immediately question what "this drink" actually is. No brand name? Vague claims? His "tendency to worry" would trigger skepticism - is this just another energy drink? With his high income, he's probably health-conscious and wary of gimmicks. 

His "Strongly Agree" on originality but "Strongly Disagree" on artistic interests suggests he values innovation but not fluff. This ad feels generic - zero unique selling points. His "Neutral" on being helpful/unselfish means he won't be swayed by emotional appeals. And as someone who "does a thorough job", he'd want evidence: ingredients? Clinical studies? 

The phrase "look your best" might even annoy him - at 50+, he's probably beyond superficial beauty claims. His "Disagree" on nervousness but "Strongly Agree" on worrying creates tension: he projects calm but internally scrutinizes everything. This ad gives him nothing substantial to latch onto, so his anxiety would amplify doubts.

For purchase intention: His high conscientiousness means he'd never buy based on such a vague claim. But his sociability ("Strongly Agree") might make him share this ad with friends as a cautionary example! Though he "worries a lot", his "emotionally stable" being Neutral suggests he won't make impulsive purchases to soothe anxiety.

Final scoring rationale:
- Ad attitude: All low (2-3) because it's unprofessional and lacks substance for his analytical mind
- Purchase intention: Near-zero (1-2) since he'd demand concrete information first
- But not 1s across the board because he's "trusting" (Agree) - maybe a tiny chance if more details were provided
