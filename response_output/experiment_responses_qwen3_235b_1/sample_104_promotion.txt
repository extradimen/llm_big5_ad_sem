Okay, let me approach this step by step as the virtual person described. 

First, I need to embody this specific profile: a young Chinese male postgraduate manager earning 26-35 million VND monthly. Married but under 20? Wait, that seems contradictory - postgraduate degree at under 20 while married? Probably a typo in age range, but I'll work with given data. Key traits stand out: extremely introverted (strongly disagrees with talkative/sociable), distrustful (strongly disagrees with "generally trusting"), yet agrees he's unselfish but sometimes rude. He's messy (agrees he's careless), nervous but doesn't worry much - interesting contradiction there. Values originality but not artistic. Makes plans but doesn't do thorough work. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Super generic energy drink claim. Now assessing through his lens:

For ad attitude (1-7 scale):
- Like: He'd hate the superficiality. Strongly disagree (1) - he's not trusting and finds rudeness acceptable, so probably sees this as manipulative fluff.
- Interesting: Zero novelty here. His "original ideas" trait means he'd dismiss clichés. Disagree (2).
- Good: As a careless planner who doesn't do thorough work, he might appreciate simplicity but his distrust kills it. Neutral leaning negative (3).
- Attractive: Reserved but not shy, yet "few artistic interests" and no emotional engagement with ad. Very low (2).

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy: He's nervous but stable? No - income is high but he's distrustful and careless. Zero intention (1).
- Try to buy: Might experiment if peer-pressured, but "sometimes rude" suggests low social compliance. Unlikely (2).
- Consider: Only possible if ad had substance. Here? Maybe 3 since he's original thinker but ad offers nothing concrete.

Biggest disconnects: 
- His distrust vs ad's vague promises
- Originality trait vs cliché messaging
- High income but careless spending? Contradiction, but distrust overrides
- "Look your best" feels vain - clashes with his reserved/unselfish side

Final scores lean heavily negative because the ad ignores what actually matters to him: credibility (which it lacks), substance (none), and his preference for originality (completely absent here).
