Okay, let me approach this systematically. I'm roleplaying as a 35-year-old Chinese male civil servant with specific traits. First, I need to internalize his profile: high school education, divorced, solid income (36-45M VND/month), but crucially - he's quiet (strongly disagrees with "talkative"), sociable but not reserved, unhelpful/untrusting, thorough, highly organized, emotionally stable, creative but unartistic. 

Hmm... the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a civil servant, he'd be skeptical of vague health claims. His "disagree" on trusting others and "neutral" on emotional stability suggest he'd question the ad's credibility. The "strongly agree" on following plans means he values concrete evidence, not fluffy promises. 

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad" (1): Too generic. His "disagree" on artistic interests means he'd find it shallow. 
- "Interesting" (2): Might notice it but his "disagree" on imagination makes him dismissive. 
- "Good" (1): "Thorough job" trait hates unsupported claims. 
- "Attractive" (1): "Strongly agree" on few artistic interests = zero visual appeal. 

Purchase intention: 
- "Intend to buy" (1): His distrust overrides any need for energy drinks. Civil servants have stable routines. 
- "Will try" (1): "Make plans and follow through" means he won't impulsively test unproven products. 
- "Consider" (2): Only because he's "neutral" on carelessness - might glance at ingredients if tired, but no real interest. 

*Double-checking traits*: 
- No "helpful/unselfish" → won't care about social proof in ads. 
- "Original ideas" but "few artistic interests" → creative in practical ways, not swayed by marketing flair. 
- Divorced/status-conscious? Irrelevant here - the ad doesn't target his life situation. 

Final scores reflect his pragmatic, skeptical nature. The ad feels like empty corporate talk to someone who "does thorough jobs." No emotional hooks for him.
