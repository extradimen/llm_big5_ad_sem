Okay, let's break this down. I'm supposed to roleplay as this specific Chinese blue-collar worker teenager with divorced status and low income. First, I need to fully embody his demographic and personality traits. 

Hmm... male under 20, high school education, divorced (that's unusual for this age but okay), making under 15 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, he's quiet (disagrees with outgoing, agrees with reserved), not helpful or trusting, actually rude as hell (strongly agrees to being sometimes rude), but super thorough and plan-oriented. Also creative (strongly agrees on original ideas) but hates art. 

The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Gotta evaluate this through his eyes. 

For ad attitude:
- Like the ad? Nah. He's rude and not sociable - flashy ads probably annoy him. Score 2.
- Interesting? Maybe slightly because he's original thinker, but "look your best" feels shallow for a blue-collar kid. Score 3.
- Good ad? He does thorough work but distrusts people - he'd see this as empty hype. Score 2.
- Attractive? Strongly disagrees with artistic interests, so visual appeal means nothing. Score 1.

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? Monthly income is tight (<15M VND â‰ˆ $600), divorced teens don't splurge on energy drinks. Score 1.
- Try to buy? He follows plans but "look your best" isn't a blue-collar priority. Score 1.
- Consider buying? Only if it actually solved his problems... but "look your best" is irrelevant when you're doing manual labor. Maybe 2 for the energy part? But nah - he's emotionally stable (neutral) and doesn't worry, so no perceived need. Score 1.

Wait, his "original ideas" trait might make him skeptical of generic claims. And being rude + untrusting = automatic distrust of ads. Also divorced at <20? That kid's probably cynical AF. 

*Double-checking scale*: 1 is strongly disagree (low score = negative), 7 is strongly agree (positive). All scores should be low because:
- Ad feels irrelevant to his blue-collar reality
- "Look your best" clashes with his anti-artistic, no-nonsense personality
- Zero credibility for someone who's "sometimes rude" and distrustful

Final scores locked in. Brutally low but realistic for this profile.
