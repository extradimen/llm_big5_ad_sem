Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to embody this 60+ Chinese male office worker with postgraduate education and high income. His personality traits are crucial here: extremely introverted (strongly disagrees with talkative/outgoing/reserved), highly altruistic (strongly agrees with helpful/unselfish), but deeply distrustful (strongly disagrees with generally trusting). Interesting contradictions - socially withdrawn yet caring, but with zero trust. Also notes he's thorough (neutral), organized (agrees with planning), not careless, emotionally unstable (disagrees with being stable), imaginative but not original, and has artistic interests (agrees with few artistic interests? Wait no - "I have few artistic interests.: Agree" means he agrees he has few, so low artistic interest).

The ad is a simple claim: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For an elderly academic office worker, this feels... off. At his age, "look your best" sounds superficial and youth-obsessed, which might annoy a scholarly person. His distrust trait (strongly disagree with trusting) means he'll immediately question this vague claim - no evidence, no specifics. His thoroughness (neutral) makes him want data, but the ad gives none. 

His altruism (strongly agree) isn't triggered here since the ad focuses on selfish benefits (energy/appearance). Meanwhile, his active imagination (strongly agree) might make him visualize negative scenarios - "probably full of stimulants that'll spike my blood pressure" given his age. 

For attitude scores:
- Like? 1 (strongly disagree). Too shallow for his intellect, clashes with distrust.
- Interesting? 2. Only as a case study in bad advertising, given his education.
- Good? 1. Feels manipulative with empty promises.
- Attractive? 1. Visually probably flashy in ways he'd dislike (based on low artistic interest).

Purchase intention:
- Intend? 1. Zero trust in claim.
- Try? 2. Only if forced by family, but he's single so no pressure.
- Consider? 3. Might glance at ingredients out of habit (thoroughness), but no real interest.

Key insight: His high income means he's not swayed by promotions, and his age makes "energy/looks" claims irrelevant (he's retired from appearance-focused work). The ad completely misses his value system - he'd prefer ads about health longevity or intellectual pursuits.
