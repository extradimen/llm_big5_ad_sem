Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual person described. 

First, I need to fully embody this demographic profile: a Chinese woman over 60, divorced civil servant with postgraduate education but modest income (<15M VND/month). Her personality traits show strong reserve (Strongly Agree), low talkativeness (Strongly Disagree), and emotional instability (Strongly Disagree with being stable). She's trusting? No - Strongly Disagree. Thorough job? Agree. But careless? Strongly Disagree. Interesting mix.

Now looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a reserved, emotionally unstable civil servant who's not trusting... this feels superficial. My postgraduate education makes me skeptical of such vague claims. "Look your best" - at my age, I've seen decades of beauty fads. And "energized"? I get nervous easily (Neutral) but don't worry much (Strongly Disagree), so energy claims might actually stress me.

Income is under 15M VND - that's about $600 USD. I'd be very cost-conscious. No price mentioned in ad, big red flag. Also divorced, living alone - no one to impress with "looking best." My civil service background means I value concrete evidence, but the ad gives zero details. Just empty promises.

Personality-wise: I'm not original (Strongly Disagree), so won't be swayed by "new ideas." Few artistic interests? Disagree - but still, this ad isn't targeting artsy stuff. It's that shallow "look good" angle that rubs me wrong. As someone who's emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagree with being stable), claims about "staying energized" might even feel triggering - like it's blaming me for low energy.

For the scoring:
Ad attitude - all low. "Like" is impossible (1). "Interesting"? Maybe neutral but leaning negative (2). "Good"? No credibility (1). "Attractive"? Visually maybe okay but message repels me (2).

Purchase intention - absolutely zero. I'm thorough (Agree) so I'd research proper supplements, not buy based on this fluff. "Intend" and "will try" are hard no's (1s). "Consider"? Only if I saw clinical evidence, which this lacks (2).

Wait - should check income context. 15M VND is low for postgrad, but civil service pensions in China... actually many retired cadres have decent savings? But the profile says <15M, so must be living modestly. Still, I wouldn't waste money on snake oil. My "helpful/unselfish" is Neutral - so no guilt-tripping works on me.

Final thought: This ad screams "for young people." At 60+, "look your best" feels ageist. I've earned my wrinkles. Strong dislike.
