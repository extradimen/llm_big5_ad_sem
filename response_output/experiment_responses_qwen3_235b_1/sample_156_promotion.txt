Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I need to evaluate this ad from the perspective of a specific demographic and personality profile. The person is a Chinese male over 60, with a high school education, working as a managerial employee. He's divorced, earns between 36-45 million VND monthly. His personality traits are a mix: he's talkative but not outgoing, not trusting, not helpful, careless, nervous, emotionally unstable, imaginative, somewhat original, but agrees he has few artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, I'll go through each of the attitude and purchase intention questions. 

Starting with ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** 
   - He's talkative (Strongly Agree) but not sociable (Disagree). He's not trusting (Strongly Disagree) and emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagree). The ad seems vague. "Stay energized and look your best" might come off as too generic or even suspicious to someone who's not trusting. He might think it's making unrealistic promises. Also, at his age, he might be skeptical of such claims. So probably low score here. Maybe 2.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** 
   - He has an active imagination (Strongly Agree) and is original (Agree). But the ad is very basic. No creative elements mentioned. Since he's imaginative, he might find this boring or lacking depth. Also, he tends to be careless (Agree), so maybe he wouldn't pay much attention. But the imagination trait could make him want more engaging content. Still, the ad is too simple. Probably 3.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** 
   - "Good" could mean well-made or credible. He's not trusting (Strongly Disagree), so he likely doubts the claim. Also, he's emotionally unstable and nervous, which might make him anxious about false ads. A vague statement like this wouldn't convince him. He does a thorough job? No, Strongly Disagree, so he might not scrutinize it but still distrusts it. Probably 2.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** 
   - Attractive could mean visually or appeal-wise. But the ad description is just text. No info on visuals. Given his few artistic interests (Agree), he might not care about aesthetics. But since he's imaginative, maybe he'd want more creativity. However, the ad is plain. Also, he's not outgoing, so flashy ads might not appeal. Likely low. Maybe 2.

Now purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** 
   - He's not trusting, so unlikely to believe the claim. High income but divorced, maybe cautious with spending. The ad doesn't provide evidence, so he'd be skeptical. Strongly Disagree on helpful/unselfish, so he might think it's a scam. No intention. Score 1.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** 
   - Similar reasons. Without trust, he won't make an effort. He's careless (Agree), so maybe he'd forget, but distrust is stronger. Probably 1.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** 
   - Even considering requires some openness. But his distrust is strong (Strongly Disagree on trusting). Maybe if there were more info, but the ad gives nothing. However, "consider" is a bit softer. But given his traits, still unlikely. Maybe 2? But wait, he's talkative—might discuss with others, but the ad itself doesn't prompt that. Probably 1 or 2. Given his nervousness and worry (though he Disagrees on worrying a lot), but Strongly Agrees on nervous easily. Might avoid trying new things due to anxiety. So 1.

Wait, let me double-check. For purchase intention consider: sometimes people consider even if skeptical. But his distrust is very high. Also, he's a managerial employee, so maybe analytical, but he Strongly Disagrees on doing a thorough job, so he might not research. Still, distrust would dominate. So 1 for all purchase intentions.

But let's see the traits again. He's imaginative and original, so maybe he'd be open to new ideas? But the ad is too vague. It doesn't spark his imagination. So no. 

Also, age >60: might be more set in his ways, less likely to try new products, especially energy drinks which are often targeted at younger people. "Look your best" might not resonate with an older man who's divorced—maybe he's past caring about that, or it feels irrelevant. 

Income is high, so affordability isn't an issue, but distrust and skepticism are bigger factors here.

So final scores:

Ad attitude: like=2, interesting=3, good=2, attractive=2

Purchase intention: intend=1, try=1, consider=1

Wait, for "consider"—maybe a tiny bit? But given Strongly Disagree on trusting, probably not. Even consider requires some minimal openness. But he Strongly Disagrees on trusting, so he'd dismiss it immediately. So 1 for all purchase intentions.
