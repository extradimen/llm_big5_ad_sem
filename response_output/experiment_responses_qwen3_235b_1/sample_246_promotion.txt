Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 20-29 year old Chinese male with high school education, single, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm strongly outgoing/sociable but also reserved and emotionally unstable. I'm not talkative, not helpful/unselfish, but I do make plans and have an active imagination. 

Looking at this energy drink ad claiming it "helps you stay energized and look your best every day" - I need to evaluate it through my specific lens. 

For ad attitude: 
- I'm strongly outgoing but also reserved, so generic ads might not grab me. The claim feels too vague - "look your best" is unrealistic. As someone who's emotionally unstable (strongly disagree with being stable), I'd be skeptical of such promises. 
- I'm not thorough (disagree with doing thorough job) and tend to be careless (strongly agree), so I might dismiss it as fluff. 
- But I do have an active imagination (agree) and am original (agree), so if it were creative I might find it interesting... but this ad isn't showing creativity. 

For purchase intention:
- With my high income (36-45M VND is top tier in Vietnam), I can afford it but... 
- I'm generally not trusting (disagree with trusting) and find the claim unconvincing. 
- Being emotionally unstable, I might actually need energy drinks, but the "look your best" part feels manipulative. 
- I make plans (agree) so I'd consider it rationally - but the ad gives no substance to base that on. 

Scoring rationale:
Ad attitude: 
- Like (2): Too generic, doesn't resonate with my skeptical/untrusting nature
- Interesting (3): Slightly more as I'm imaginative, but ad lacks creativity
- Good (2): Poor execution - no proof, feels dishonest
- Attractive (2): Visually might be ok but message is weak

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Zero trust in claims
- Try (2): Maybe out of curiosity due to high income, but unlikely
- Consider (3): Might glance at it in store since I'm careless, but no real interest

This feels authentic to my profile - high skepticism, emotional volatility, and careless tendencies overriding the sociable aspect that might normally respond to ads.
