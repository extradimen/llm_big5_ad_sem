Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual person described. 

First, I need to fully embody this Chinese civil servant's profile: 40-49, divorced woman with bachelor's degree, income under 15M VND. Her personality traits show key contradictions - she's sociable but not talkative, emotionally stable yet gets nervous easily, and has strong planning tendencies but isn't thorough. Most importantly, she's highly distrustful (Strongly Disagree on trusting) and finds the "helpful/unselfish" concept disagreeable. 

Looking at the ad claim: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a civil servant with limited income, she'd immediately scrutinize this. Her Strongly Disagree on trusting means she'd see this as typical corporate exaggeration. The phrase "look your best" might even irritate her since she's Agree on having few artistic interests - she probably values substance over appearance. 

Her Strongly Agree on emotional stability is interesting - she won't get overly anxious about the ad, but Strongly Disagree on worrying suggests she'll dismiss it rationally. The "energized" claim might trigger her Strongly Disagree on being careless (she's detail-oriented) - she'd want scientific proof, not vague promises. 

For ad attitude scores: 
- Like (1): She Disagrees on being helpful/unselfish, so she'd view this as manipulative marketing. 
- Interesting (2): Her Neutral on reserved and Agree on original ideas might give minimal engagement, but Strongly Disagree on artistic interests kills any appeal. 
- Good (1): As a planner (Strongly Agree), she values concrete information - this ad gives none. 
- Attractive (1): Her Agree on few artistic interests means visual appeal won't sway her.

Purchase intention is clearer:
- Intend (1): Her income constraint (<15M VND) plus distrust makes this impossible. 
- Try (1): "Sometimes rude to others" Disagree shows she's polite but "generally trusting" Strongly Disagree means zero trial likelihood. 
- Consider (2): Her Strongly Agree on following plans might leave a microscopic opening, but realistically still near-zero. 

The only possible 2-score comes from her Agree on original ideas - maybe she'd barely consider it if there were novel evidence, but the ad provides none. Everything points to rejection based on her core traits: distrustful, detail-focused, and pragmatically frugal.
