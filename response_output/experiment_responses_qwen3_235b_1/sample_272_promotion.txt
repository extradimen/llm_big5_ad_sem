Alright, let's tackle this. So, I'm supposed to role-play as this specific demographic: a Chinese woman over 60, high school education, currently a student (which is interesting because at her age, maybe she's in a community college or something?), divorced, low income. Personality-wise, she's talkative, outgoing, sociable, but also strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish, which is a bit contradictory but okay. She's trusting, not rude, doesn't do thorough jobs, doesn't follow through on plans, emotionally unstable, has an active imagination but also few artistic interests? Wait, no, the traits say "I have few artistic interests: Agree." Hmm, and she's original with new ideas.

The ad is: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

First, I need to evaluate her attitude toward the ad and purchase intention. Using a 7-point scale.

Breaking down her traits:

- **Strongly Disagree with "helpful/unselfish"**: So she's not altruistic. Might be skeptical of ads that seem to promote selflessness or community. But this ad is about personal benefit (energy, looks), so maybe that's okay? But she might think it's selfish, but since she's not helpful to others, maybe she's more self-focused? Wait, "Strongly Disagree" with being helpful/unselfish means she's selfish. So she might like an ad that's all about her own benefit. But wait, the ad is promoting personal benefits, so maybe that aligns.

- **Strongly Agree with "generally trusting"**: So she might believe the ad more easily. But she's also "emotionally unstable: Disagree" wait no, "I am emotionally stable.: Disagree" so she's emotionally unstable. That could mean she's more prone to anxiety or mood swings, which might make her skeptical or more vulnerable to ads promising stability.

Wait, the traits:

- I am emotionally stable.: Disagree → So she's NOT emotionally stable. So she might be more anxious or moody.

- I get nervous easily.: Strongly Disagree → So she doesn't get nervous easily. Contradicts the emotional instability? Hmm, maybe the emotional instability is more about mood swings rather than anxiety.

But "I worry a lot.: Disagree" so she doesn't worry much. So even though she's emotionally unstable (maybe meaning mood swings), she doesn't worry or get nervous. Interesting.

- **Strongly Disagree with "make plans and follow through"**: So she's impulsive, doesn't plan. Might be more spontaneous in purchases, but also might not follow through on buying.

- **Disagree with "do a thorough job"**: Not detail-oriented. So she might not research the product, just go by the ad.

- **Agree with "original, new ideas"**: Might appreciate creativity in ads, but the ad here is pretty generic.

- **Agree with "few artistic interests"**: So the ad's creativity might not matter much to her.

- **Monthly income <15M VND**: In Vietnam, 15M VND is about $600 USD. For someone over 60 in China? Wait, region is Chinese, but income in VND? That's confusing. Maybe it's a typo, but assuming it's low income regardless. So price-sensitive. The ad doesn't mention price, so she might assume it's expensive or not affordable.

The ad says "stay energized and look your best." For a 60+ woman, "look your best" might resonate with anti-aging, but she's a student? Maybe she's in a program for seniors. But her priority might be health, energy for studies, but also cost is a factor.

She's trusting (Strongly Agree), so she might believe the claim, but her low income makes her cautious about spending. Also, she's not thorough, so she might not check if it's true, but since she's emotionally unstable (but doesn't worry), maybe she's impulsive.

But she's "Strongly Disagree" with being helpful, so very self-centered. The ad is about self-benefit, which aligns. But does she care about looking her best? At 60+, maybe she does, but the ad is very vague. "Look your best" is a common claim, might seem untrustworthy.

Her personality: outgoing, talkative, sociable. So she might discuss the ad with friends, but since she's not helpful, maybe not. But she's trusting, so if friends recommend, she might believe.

But the ad itself: very generic. No specifics. For someone who's original (Agree with new ideas), this ad might seem cliché. She might think it's boring.

Also, she's a student, so maybe she needs energy for studying. But at her age, maybe she's taking classes for fun, not for career. So energy could be relevant.

But low income: even if she likes the idea, she might not afford it. The ad doesn't address price, so she might assume it's costly.

Attitude toward ad:

1. I like the ad: She's sociable, but the ad is bland. She's original, so might find it uncreative. Score low, maybe 3.

2. Interesting: Generic claim, nothing new. She has active imagination (Neutral), but few artistic interests. Probably not interesting. 2.

3. Believes it's good: She's trusting, but also emotionally unstable? Wait, she doesn't worry, but is emotionally unstable. Maybe she's skeptical because she's not thorough? Or trusting so she believes. But "Strongly Agree" with trusting, so she might think it's good. But "do a thorough job: Disagree" so she doesn't check, but trusts. Hmm. Maybe 5? But the ad is very vague, so even trusting people might see it as too generic. Maybe 4.

4. Attractive: Visually? The ad text is given, but no description of visuals. Assuming plain text ad. She's not artistic, so visuals might not matter. But "look your best" might have images of vibrant older people. If it's attractive imagery, she might like it. But since she's emotionally unstable, maybe she's sensitive to such images. But she's outgoing, so positive images might appeal. However, low income, so might feel it's not for her. Maybe 3.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: Low income, ad doesn't mention price. She's impulsive (doesn't plan), but also not thorough. But "Strongly Disagree" with follow through, so even if she intends, she might not do it. But the question is about intention. She might intend but not follow. But does she want to? She needs energy, but skeptical due to vagueness. Probably low. 2.

2. Will try to buy: Similar. Low income, so even if interested, can't afford. 1 or 2.

3. Will consider: She's trusting, so might consider, but ad is too generic. "Consider" is lower bar. Maybe 3.

Wait, her traits: "I make plans and follow through: Strongly Disagree" so she doesn't plan purchases. But "consider" is just thinking about it. She might consider but not act.

Also, she's "emotionally unstable: Disagree" wait no, the trait is "I am emotionally stable.: Disagree" so she's emotionally unstable. That might make her more impulsive in decisions, but also more prone to regret. But the ad's promise might appeal to her desire for stability (energy, looking good).

But the ad is very shallow. For someone who's original, it's not creative. She might dismiss it.

Also, "helpful/unselfish: Strongly Disagree" so she's selfish, but the ad is selfish-focused, so that aligns. But does that make her like it more? Possibly.

But income is a big factor. At <15M VND/month (assuming VND is a mistake, but taking it as low), she's budget-conscious. The ad doesn't address affordability, so she might assume it's expensive.

So attitude scores: like (3), interesting (2), good (3), attractive (3).

Purchase: intend (1), try (1), consider (2).

Wait, but she's trusting. So maybe she believes it, but can't afford. So consider might be higher.

Consider: she might think about it, but not intend to buy because of cost.

So consider: 3, intend and try: 1 or 2.

But the scale is 1-7, 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree.

For purchase intention:

- I intend to purchase: Strongly disagree (1) because can't afford.

- Will try to buy: Also 1.

- Will consider: Maybe 3, since she's trusting, might think about it despite cost.

Ad attitude:

- Like: 3 (neutral, not impressed)

- Interesting: 2 (boring)

- Good: 3 (okay but generic)

- Attractive: 3 (not ugly but nothing special)

But let's cross-check traits.

She's outgoing, sociable: might like ads that are fun, but this is plain.

Original: Agree, so values creativity. Ad is uncreative → dislike.

Trusts easily: so might rate "good" higher? But the ad's claim is vague, even trusting people might see it as flimsy.

Emotionally unstable: might be more affected by emotional appeals, but the ad isn't emotional.

"Look your best" could tap into vanity, which she might care about as a sociable person.

But at 60+, and divorced, maybe she cares about appearance to attract attention? But divorced, so maybe not. Or to feel confident.

But low income is the biggest barrier.

So ad attitude scores:

Like: 3 (meh)

Interesting: 2 (not at all)

Good: 3 (not bad but not great)

Attractive: 3 (visually maybe okay, but text ad so assume neutral)

Purchase:

Intend: 1 (no way, can't afford)

Try: 1 (same)

Consider: 2 (barely think about it, but dismiss due to cost)

But she's trusting, so consider might be 3.

Wait, the instruction says: "You may like the ad but still not want to buy." So she might like the ad (score 4-5) but not buy due to cost.

But does she like the ad? Her traits: talkative, sociable, but the ad isn't engaging. Original thinker, so finds it unoriginal. Trusting, so doesn't hate it, but not impressed.

So ad attitude: all around 3-4? But she's "Strongly Disagree" with being helpful, which might make her cynical, but the ad isn't about helping others.

Actually, her selfishness might make her like self-focused ads. So maybe she likes it more.

But the ad is very generic. For someone who's original, it's boring.

So:

Like: 3 (neutral)

Interesting: 2 (not interesting)

Good: 3

Attractive: 3

Purchase:

Intend: 1

Try: 1

Consider: 2

But let's see similar examples. If an ad says "lose weight fast", a trusting person might believe, but if low income, won't buy.

Here, "stay energized and look best" – for a student over 60, energy is relevant, but cost is prohibitive.

She doesn't plan purchases (Strongly Disagree with follow through), so even if she considers, she won't act. But the question is about intention, not action.

"Consider buying" means she'll think about it, which she might, because she's trusting.

So consider: 4? But low income might stop even consideration.

In low-income groups, they still consider products but prioritize needs.

As a student, maybe she needs energy for classes, so it's relevant.

But the ad doesn't specify it's affordable.

So consider: 3 (somewhat consider, but doubtful)

Intend and try: 2 (slightly, but unlikely)

But the scale is 1-7, with 1=strongly disagree (i.e., strongly disagree that I intend to purchase).

So for "I intend to purchase", 1 means "I strongly disagree that I intend to purchase", i.e., absolutely not.

Given her income, 1 or 2.

Similarly for try.

Consider: 3 or 4.

But her trait "make plans: Strongly Disagree" suggests she doesn't deliberate much, so "consider" might be low.

"Consider" is a low bar – just thinking about it.

Even impulsive people consider briefly.

So consider: 3.

Final scores:

ad_attitude: [3,2,3,3]

purchase: [1,1,3]

But let's double-check.

Another angle: she's emotionally unstable (but doesn't worry or get nervous), so maybe the promise of stability (energy, looking good) appeals, but the ad is too vague to trigger that.

Also, "look your best" at 60+ might be appealing, but if the ad uses young models, she might feel excluded. But the ad text doesn't specify, so assume it's inclusive.

But without visuals, hard to say.

Given all, I think:

ad_attitude_scores: like=3, interesting=2, good=3, attractive=3

purchase_intention: intend=1, try=1, consider=3

Yes.
