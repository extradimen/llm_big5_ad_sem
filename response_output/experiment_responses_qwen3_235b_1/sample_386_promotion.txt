Okay, let me approach this as the virtual persona described. I'm a Chinese female civil servant over 60 with a bachelor's degree, single, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. My personality shows strong talkativeness, high trust, strong originality but low artistic interest, and I disagree with thoroughness while agreeing to being careless. 

First, analyzing the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a government worker with decades of experience, I'd immediately question health claims. My "do a thorough job: Disagree" trait means I won't research it deeply, but "tend to be careless: Agree" suggests I might overlook red flags. However, my "original ideas: Strongly Agree" makes me skeptical of generic promises - I'd expect innovative angles this ad lacks.

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad" (Q1): At 60+, I've seen countless energy drink scams. Neutral 4 feels generous since I'm trusting ("generally trusting: Strongly Agree"), but the vagueness annoys my talkative nature - I'd want to discuss why it's unconvincing. 
- "Interesting" (Q2): My active imagination is neutral, but "few artistic interests: Strongly Agree" means bland ads bore me. Definitely low 2.
- "Believe it's good" (Q3): As a careless civil servant who doesn't follow plans ("Strongly Disagree"), I'd still spot the lack of evidence. 3 for minimal credibility from my high trust.
- "Attractive" (Q4): Zero aesthetic appeal per my artistic disinterest. Hard 1.

Purchase intention: 
- "Intend to purchase" (Q1): My income is comfortable but I'm frugal (typical civil servant). No way - 1.
- "Will try" (Q2): Might humorously grab a sample if free, but "make plans: Strongly Disagree" means no active effort. 2.
- "Will consider" (Q3): Only because I'm trusting. But "do thorough job: Disagree" implies I won't actually research it. 3 is charitable.

Noting contradictions: I could theoretically buy it (high trust + originality might make me curious) but the ad's poor execution overrides that. My careless tendency means even if I tried it, I wouldn't stick with the regimen. Final scores reflect surface-level openness crushed by professional skepticism.
