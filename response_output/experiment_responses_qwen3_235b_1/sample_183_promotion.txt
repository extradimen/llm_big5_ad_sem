Okay, let me step into the shoes of this Chinese woman over 60. She's got a postgraduate degree but works as a blue-collar worker? That's interesting—maybe she retrained later in life or has a unique career path. Her income is in Vietnamese Dong (26-35 million VND/month), which is actually quite high for Vietnam—roughly $1,000-$1,400 USD. But she's divorced, blue-collar, and educated... Hmm, maybe she's a skilled technician or supervisor?  

Her personality traits are key here. She's *outgoing* (Agree) but *not talkative* (Disagree)—so she's sociable but not chatty, maybe warm but reserved in speech. *Strongly Disagrees* with being reserved though? Contradiction? Wait no—she Disagrees with "I am reserved," meaning she sees herself as *not* reserved. Got it. She's helpful (Agree) but *not* trusting (Strongly Disagree)—that's crucial. High income but blue-collar? Maybe she's pragmatic, hardworking, but skeptical after life experience (divorced, older).  

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Ugh, classic vague wellness claim. As someone with *Strongly Disagree* on "I worry a lot" but *Strongly Disagree* on "emotionally stable"? Wait, that's confusing—she says she doesn't worry but isn't emotionally stable? Maybe she's resilient but volatile? Or the traits are poorly worded. Anyway, she's *not* trusting (Strongly Disagree on "generally trusting"), so she'll eye-roll at empty promises.  

Also, she *Agrees* with "I am original, come up with new ideas" but *Disagrees* with "I have few artistic interests." So she's creative but not artsy—maybe practical innovation? Like optimizing workflows? This ad feels fluffy to her. "Look your best" reeks of superficial beauty standards. At 60+, divorced, blue-collar—she's seen through this nonsense. Her high income means she can afford skepticism; she won't fall for "energized" claims without proof.  

Ad attitude scores:  
- *Like*: 2. Too generic. She values substance (helpful, unselfish), not hype.  
- *Interesting*: 3. Mild curiosity but "look your best" feels age-irrelevant. She's past that.  
- *Good*: 2. Feels manipulative. She's not trusting, so "helps you stay energized" = red flag.  
- *Attractive*: 1. "Look your best" targets younger women. She's divorced, blue-collar—probably values authenticity over glamour.  

Purchase intention:  
- *Intend*: 1. Zero trust in vague claims. Blue-collar pragmatism.  
- *Try*: 2. *Maybe* if a trusted friend vouches, but ad alone? No.  
- *Consider*: 3. Only if she sees concrete evidence (which the ad lacks). Her "make plans and follow through" trait means she researches—this ad gives nothing to go on.  

Her postgraduate degree makes her analytical. She'll scoff: "Where's the data? What's *in* it?" And "look your best" at her age? Insulting. She's got dignity—doesn't need drinks for validation. Also, high income but blue-collar? She knows value. This screams overpriced placebo.  

Final scores: Ad attitude is low (1-3), purchase intent near-zero (1-3). She's critical, not gullible. The ad feels like it's for someone else entirely.
