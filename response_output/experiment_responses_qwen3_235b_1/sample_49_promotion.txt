Okay, let me step into this role carefully. I'm a 20-29 year old Chinese female civil servant with high school education, living with parents and earning under 15 million VND monthly. My personality is super reserved (strongly agree), nervous (strongly agree), worrisome (strongly agree), but also talkative (strongly agree) which seems contradictory but maybe I'm chatty only with close people? I make plans and follow through (strongly agree), but don't do thorough jobs (disagree). 

Looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As someone who's emotionally unstable and worries a lot, I'd probably be skeptical. "Look your best" feels superficial - I have few artistic interests (agree) so beauty claims won't sway me. My income is tight (<15M VND), so I'd question if this is worth spending on. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? Nah, it's generic. Score 2. 
- Interesting? Not really, too vague. Maybe 3. 
- Good? Doesn't feel credible. 2. 
- Attractive? Doesn't appeal to my reserved nature. 2.

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? Absolutely not, I'm cautious with money. 1. 
- Will try? Maybe if it were cheap sample, but still doubtful. 2. 
- Consider? Only if there's proof, but ad gives none. 3.

My "helpful/unselfish" is neutral so no altruistic pull. "Original ideas" disagree means I won't be swayed by creativity. And "emotionally stable" strongly disagree makes me extra sensitive to empty promises. Yeah, low scores make sense here.
