We are given a demographic profile and personality traits. Let's break down how this person would react to the ad.

Demographic:
- Chinese female under 20, postgraduate degree (which is unusual for under 20 but we'll go with it), single, monthly income <15,000,000 VND (which is about $600-700 USD, so not very high for a postgraduate? but note: in China, VND is Vietnamese Dong, but the region is Chinese. Wait, the currency is VND? That might be a mistake because China uses CNY. However, the problem states it, so we take it as given. But note: 15,000,000 VND is about 4,500 CNY? Actually, 1 CNY ≈ 3,300 VND, so 15,000,000 VND ≈ 4,545 CNY. For a student in China, that might be a reasonable stipend or part-time income, but note she's a postgraduate and under 20, which is very young for a postgraduate in China. However, we must go by the given data.)

Personality traits (with my interpretation for ad response):

- I am talkative.: Strongly Agree -> likes to talk, so might share opinions about ads
- I am outgoing, sociable.: Agree -> somewhat outgoing
- I am reserved.: Strongly Agree -> this seems contradictory? But note: she can be both outgoing and reserved in different contexts? Or perhaps the "reserved" trait is in certain situations. However, the combination might indicate she is selective about when she opens up.
- I am helpful and unselfish with others.: Agree -> altruistic
- I am generally trusting.: Agree -> but note: she sometimes rude, so maybe not entirely trusting?
- I am sometimes rude to others.: Agree -> can be blunt
- I do a thorough job.: Agree -> careful and detailed
- I make plans and follow through with them.: Strongly Disagree -> impulsive, not organized
- I tend to be careless.: Neutral -> not particularly careless
- I get nervous easily.: Strongly Agree -> anxious
- I worry a lot.: Disagree -> but note: she gets nervous easily but doesn't worry a lot? Maybe she has anxiety but doesn't ruminate?
- I am emotionally stable.: Agree -> but wait, she gets nervous easily? This seems contradictory. However, the traits are independent. Maybe she has moments of stability but is easily nervous? Or perhaps the "emotionally stable" is in the long term? We have to take as given.
- I have an active imagination.: Agree -> creative
- I am original, come up with new ideas.: Neutral -> not particularly innovative
- I have few artistic interests.: Strongly Agree -> not into art

Now, the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

Analysis from her perspective:

1. She is under 20, a postgraduate (which is very advanced for her age, so she might be a prodigy or the education system is different? But in China, it's rare to be a postgraduate under 20). She is likely a student, so she might need energy for studies. However, she is anxious (gets nervous easily) and emotionally stable? Wait, she says she is emotionally stable but gets nervous easily? That might be a conflict. Let's assume she has anxiety but considers herself stable overall? Or perhaps the emotional stability is in terms of not having mood swings? But the ad is about energy and looking good.

2. She is reserved and sometimes rude, so she might be critical and not easily swayed by superficial ads.

3. She does a thorough job, so she might look for evidence and details. The ad is very vague: "helps you stay energized and look your best". No specifics, no brand, no proof. As someone who does a thorough job, she might find it lacking.

4. She is outgoing and sociable (to some extent) and talkative, so she might discuss the ad with friends, but her reserved side might make her skeptical.

5. She has few artistic interests and is not very original, so she might not be drawn to ads that are too creative or artistic. This ad is simple and straightforward, but also generic.

6. She gets nervous easily, so she might be concerned about side effects (e.g., if the drink has caffeine, it might make her more nervous). The ad doesn't address safety.

7. She is emotionally stable (she says) but gets nervous easily? This is confusing. However, she disagrees with "I worry a lot", so maybe she has anxiety but doesn't let it dominate. Still, the ad's claim might seem too good to be true and trigger skepticism.

8. She is trusting (Agree) but also sometimes rude, which might indicate she is honest and blunt, so she might call out false claims.

9. She makes plans and follows through: Strongly Disagree -> she is impulsive and not organized. So she might not plan purchases, but that doesn't mean she won't buy on impulse. However, the ad is very generic and might not trigger an impulse buy because it's not specific.

10. Monthly income is less than 15 million VND (about 4,500 CNY). In China, for a student, this might be a decent amount, but she might be budget-conscious. The ad doesn't mention price, so she might assume it's expensive or not.

11. She is single and under 20, so "look your best" might appeal to her for social reasons (dating, social events). But she is reserved, so maybe she doesn't care as much about appearance? However, she is a young woman, so appearance might matter.

But note: she has few artistic interests and is not into art, so she might not be very focused on aesthetics. However, "look your best" is about general appearance, which might still be relevant.

Overall, the ad is very generic and lacks credibility. It doesn't provide any evidence, brand, or specific benefits. As someone who does a thorough job, she would likely be skeptical. Also, because she gets nervous easily, she might worry about the ingredients (e.g., sugar, caffeine) that could worsen her anxiety.

Attitude toward the ad:

1. I like the ad: Probably not. It's too vague and doesn't resonate with her critical nature. She is reserved and sometimes rude, so she might think it's cheesy. Score: low, maybe 2 or 3.

2. I think the ad is interesting: It's a very common claim. With her active imagination, she might think of counter-examples or flaws. But she has few artistic interests, so she might not engage deeply. However, she does a thorough job, so she might analyze it critically and find it uninteresting. Score: 3.

3. I believe the ad is good: As an ad, it's poorly done because it lacks substance. She is critical and thorough. Score: 2.

4. I find the ad attractive: The ad is text-only in the description. Without visuals, but even if there were visuals, she has few artistic interests, so she might not be moved by aesthetics. Also, the message is generic. Score: 2.

Purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product: She is skeptical of the claim. Without brand or evidence, she wouldn't intend to buy. Also, she might worry about side effects (given her anxiety). Score: 1.

2. I will try to buy this product: Same reasons. She does a thorough job, so she'd research first. But the ad doesn't give enough to even prompt research. Score: 1.

3. I will consider buying this product: Maybe if she sees it in store, but the ad itself isn't compelling. However, she is a student who might need energy, so she might consider energy drinks in general, but not because of this ad. The ad doesn't differentiate the product. Score: 2 (slightly above 1 because she might consider energy drinks as a category, but not because of this ad).

But note: she gets nervous easily, so energy drinks (if they contain stimulants) might be off-putting. She might avoid them.

Also, her income is not high, so she might be price-sensitive. The ad doesn't mention price, so she might assume it's expensive.

Let's assign scores:

Ad attitude:
- like: 2 (she doesn't like it because it's vague and unconvincing)
- interesting: 3 (a bit interesting because she might analyze why it's bad, but not really)
- good: 2 (as an ad, it's poorly done)
- attractive: 2 (not attractive to her)

Purchase intention:
- intend: 1 (no intention)
- try: 1 (won't try because of skepticism)
- consider: 2 (might consider energy drinks in general, but not this specific product from the ad)

But note: the ad says "this drink", so it's for a specific product. Without more info, she won't consider it.

However, she is a young student who might need energy, so she might be in the market for such products. But the ad doesn't help her choose this one.

Given her traits, she is critical and thorough, so she would need more information.

Also, she is emotionally stable (she says) but gets nervous easily. The ad claims to help with energy and appearance, which might be appealing, but without evidence, she won't believe it.

Final scores:

ad_attitude_scores: [2, 3, 2, 2]
purchase_intention_scores: [1, 1, 2]

But let's double-check:

- She is talkative and outgoing: might she be more positive? But the ad is not engaging her in conversation. It's a one-liner.

- She is helpful and unselfish: but the ad is about personal benefit, so it might not appeal to her altruism.

- She is trusting: but the ad is too vague to trust. Trusting doesn't mean gullible; she does a thorough job.

So the scores seem reasonable.

Note: The ad type is "promotion", as given.
