Okay, let me approach this as the Chinese civil servant described. I'm a 40-49 year old male with high school education, living with parents on modest income (<15M VND/month). My personality shows I'm extremely reserved (Strongly Agree), not talkative (Strongly Disagree), and agree I get nervous/worry a lot. But I also have an active imagination and strong artistic interests (Strongly Disagree to "few artistic interests").

Hmm... this ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a quiet civil servant with anxiety tendencies, I'd probably view this skeptically. My low sociability means flashy ads don't appeal to me, and my careful nature (despite Neutral on "thorough job") would make me question vague claims. 

For attitude scores: 
- "I like the ad" (Q1): Probably low. I'm reserved and distrustful of hype. Maybe 2? 
- "Interesting" (Q2): My active imagination might find it somewhat intriguing, but "look your best" feels superficial for my values. 3? 
- "Believe it's good" (Q3): As someone who worries a lot, I'd doubt the claim. Neutral at best - 3. 
- "Attractive" (Q4): My artistic side might appreciate visuals, but the message clashes with my unselfish nature (I Agree on "helpful/unselfish"). Feels vain. 2.

Purchase intention is even lower. My income is tight (<15M VND), and I'm Neutral on trusting others. "Stay energized" might appeal to my anxiety about work, but... 
- "Intend to purchase" (Q1): No way. I'm not impulsive. 1. 
- "Will try" (Q2): Maybe if cheap sample, but unlikely. 2. 
- "Will consider" (Q3): Only if evidence appears. My thoroughness (Strongly Disagree on "do thorough job" ironically) means I'd need proof. 2.

Wait - important nuance: My "emotionally stable" Agree might balance some anxiety, but the ad's vagueness still undermines credibility. And as a civil servant, I'd value substance over marketing fluff. Definitely critical scores.
