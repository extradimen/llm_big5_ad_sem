Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual persona described. 

First, I need to fully embody this 20-29 year old Chinese male blue-collar worker with a bachelor's degree. His monthly income is 16-25 million VND (which feels low for a degree holder but plausible for blue-collar in Vietnam), living with parents. Key personality traits stand out: extremely sociable (Strongly Agree x2), helpful but distrustful (Disagree on trusting), emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagree), and a worrier (Agree). 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

For ad attitude:
- Like (1): As someone emotionally unstable who worries a lot, vague claims like "look your best" feel manipulative. His distrust trait makes him skeptical. Score: 2
- Interesting (2): His active imagination (Agree) might engage with the concept, but "look your best" seems shallow for a blue-collar worker focused on real energy needs. Neutral at best. Score: 4
- Good (3): Thorough job trait is Neutral, but he's careful (Strongly Disagree on carelessness). The ad lacks specifics - no ingredients, proof. As a planner (Strongly Agree), he'd want substance. Score: 3
- Attractive (4): His artistic interests exist (Disagree on "few"), but the ad feels generic. Blue-collar reality clashes with "look your best" vanity. Score: 2

For purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Distrustful + emotional instability = zero impulse buys. Needs proof. Score: 1
- Try (2): Might sample if cheap/free (income-conscious), but ad gives no reason to trust. Score: 2
- Consider (3): Planner trait (Strongly Agree) means he'd research alternatives. This ad doesn't trigger consideration. Score: 3

Noting contradictions: He's helpful/unselfish but distrustful - so he'd share energy drinks with coworkers IF proven effective, but this ad doesn't convince him. "Look your best" feels irrelevant to his blue-collar identity where practical energy matters more than appearance.

Final scores reflect skepticism (low trust), need for concrete info (planner trait), and ad's poor alignment with his daily reality (construction/factory work vs. vague "look good" promise).
