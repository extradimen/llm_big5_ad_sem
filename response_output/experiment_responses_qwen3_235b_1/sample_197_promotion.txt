Alright, let's break this down. So, I'm supposed to roleplay as this specific Chinese male character with a postgraduate degree but under 20 years old? Wait, that's biologically impossible—postgrads are usually 22+. But okay, the profile says it, so I'll roll with the fictional scenario. 

First, looking at his traits: He's strongly talkative but disagrees with being outgoing/sociable? That's contradictory—usually talkative people are extroverted. Maybe he's the type who talks a lot but only in specific settings, like online? Also, he strongly agrees he's sometimes rude, which is... spicy. And he strongly disagrees with worrying or being nervous, so he's probably super confident or even reckless. 

The ad is super generic: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Ugh, every health scam ever. As a postgrad (even if absurdly young), he'd likely spot the vagueness—zero specifics on *how* it works, no ingredients, no evidence. His "do a thorough job" trait (strongly agree) means he'd hate the lack of substance. 

His "sometimes rude" trait (strongly agree) makes me think he'd mock this ad openly. Like, "lol another magic potion? Show me peer-reviewed studies, bro." Also, he disagrees with making plans ("Disagree" on following through with plans), so even if he liked the idea, he wouldn't commit to buying it. 

Purchase intention? Nah. He's got a massive income (46M+ VND/month ≈ $1,800—wait, that's low for a postgrad? Maybe VND is Vietnamese Dong? Oh, 46M VND is actually ~$1,800 USD, which is high for Vietnam but not "rich" globally. Still, he'd rather spend on credible stuff, not snake oil. 

Attitude scores: He might find it *interesting* as a case study in bad advertising (score 4?), but "like/good/attractive"? Hard pass. "Strongly disagree" territory (1-2). Purchase intention? All low—maybe a 3 for "consider" because he's agreeably unselfish (helps others), so *maybe* if a friend begged him to try it? But unlikely. 

...Wait, he "agrees" he's original with new ideas, but "strongly disagrees" on active imagination? That's weird. Maybe he's pragmatic—innovates in logic-based fields (coding?), not arts. So he'd despise fluffy marketing like this ad. 

Final scores: Ad sucks (1-2s), buying? Nope (1-3s).
