Okay, let me approach this step by step as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to embody this 60+ year old Chinese male blue-collar worker with specific traits. His income is high for Vietnam (26-35 million VND/month â‰ˆ $1,070-$1,440 USD), but he's only high school educated. Key personality points: he's sociable yet reserved (interesting contradiction), strongly disagrees with being unselfish, worries a lot but feels emotionally stable, and strongly agrees he does thorough work but disagrees about following plans.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... For an elderly manual laborer, "energized" might resonate with work stamina, but "look your best" feels irrelevant - he's past caring about appearance. His high neuroticism (strongly agrees he worries a lot) makes him skeptical of such claims. Also, he's careless (agrees) and doesn't follow plans (disagrees), so impulse buys are unlikely.

Breaking down ad attitude:
- Like (score 2): Too flashy for his reserved nature. He'd prefer practical ads.
- Interesting (score 3): Might catch eye briefly, but "look your best" feels superficial for his age/work.
- Good (score 2): Doesn't align with his thorough, no-nonsense work ethic. Feels gimmicky.
- Attractive (score 2): Visuals probably show young models - zero relevance to him.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (score 1): Absolutely not. He distrusts "miracle" claims (high worry trait).
- Try (score 1): Would never waste money on unproven energy drinks at his age.
- Consider (score 2): *Maybe* if it were cheaper medicine, but this feels like soda marketing. 

His income is decent but he's frugal (blue-collar mindset). With high anxiety, he'd research proper vitamins instead of trusting ads. Also, he's "not unselfish" - meaning he prioritizes practical needs over others' opinions, so "look your best" is meaningless.

Final scoring reflects deep skepticism. Only "consider" gets a 2 because... well, maybe if it were on sale at the local pharmacy next to his hypertension meds. But even that's a stretch.
