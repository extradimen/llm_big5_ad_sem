Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user has provided a very detailed demographic and personality profile for me to embody as a Chinese male postgraduate office worker in his late teens/early 20s with high income. 

First, I need to analyze how this specific persona would react to the energy drink ad. The ad claims the drink "helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Given the personality traits: strongly disagree on talkativeness, neutral on sociability, strongly disagree on being helpful/unselfish, disagree on trust, and strongly disagree on emotional stability. Also notable are the agree scores for imagination/originality and disagree for artistic interests.

Hmm... this person seems highly pragmatic and skeptical. The high income (26-35M VND/month is actually very high for Vietnam, suggesting elite status) combined with postgraduate education implies he'd demand evidence. His "make plans and follow through" trait (agree) suggests he values concrete results, but "do a thorough job" is disagree - interesting contradiction meaning he plans but may cut corners.

The ad's vague claims would trigger his skepticism. "Look your best" feels shallow for someone who's emotionally unstable (strongly disagree) - he probably struggles with appearance anxiety but won't trust a drink to fix it. His originality trait means he'd see through generic marketing. 

For ad attitude scores: 
- Like? No, he'd find it superficial (1)
- Interesting? Maybe slightly due to imagination trait, but still low (2)
- Good? Absolutely not - feels manipulative (1)
- Attractive? Visually maybe, but personality rejects hype (2)

Purchase intention is clearer:
- Intend to buy? Zero (1)
- Try? Only if peer pressure, but he's untrusting (1)
- Consider? Might glance at ingredients but dismisses claims (2)

Wait - must remember the income level. He could afford it but despises being marketed to. The "helpful/unselfish" strongly disagree suggests he's purely self-interested, so if it worked he'd buy, but the ad gives no proof. 

*Double-checking traits*: 
- "Emotionally stable: strongly disagree" - means he's actually unstable, so "look your best" might resonate emotionally but the ad feels inauthentic to him. Still, skepticism wins.
- "Original ideas: agree" - he'd invent better solutions than drinking something.

Final scores locked in: ad attitude is harshly negative (1,2,1,2), purchase intention near-zero (1,1,2). The slight consideration (2) comes only from his planning trait making him evaluate all options, however implausible.
