Okay, let me approach this step by step as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this 60+ Chinese woman with high school education, divorced, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. Her personality traits are crucial here: she's reserved (strongly agree), somewhat rude (agree), careless (strongly agree), but also original and imaginative. Interesting contradictions - quiet but creative, messy but thorough in planning. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... For an elderly woman who worries a lot (strongly agree) but is emotionally neutral, this might trigger skepticism. She's not particularly helpful/unselfish (disagree) so "look your best" could feel vain or irrelevant. Her strong carelessness trait suggests she'd notice if the claim seems too good to be true.

Breaking down ad attitude:
- Like? She's reserved and sometimes rude - probably dislikes pushy ads. Score 2.
- Interesting? She has artistic interests (neutral) but original ideas (strongly agree) - might find it clich√©. Score 3.
- Good? As a thorough planner (agree) but careless (strongly agree), she'd question credibility. Score 2.
- Attractive? Her reserved nature + worry tendency makes flashy claims unappealing. Score 2.

Purchase intention is clearer:
- Intend to buy? With high income but disagreeing on trustworthiness, plus her worry trait - no way. Score 1.
- Try buying? Her carelessness might make her impulsive, but "rude to others" suggests low patience for gimmicks. Score 1.
- Consider? Even as a planner (agree), the ad's vagueness ("this drink") lacks specifics she'd need. Score 2.

Noting key conflicts: Her creativity (strongly agree) might appreciate original ads, but this generic claim fails. High income means she's not desperate for energy boosts. Divorced status at 60+ implies self-sufficiency - "look your best" feels patronizing.

Final scores reflect deep skepticism. She'd probably mutter "Another fake health drink" while scrolling past.
