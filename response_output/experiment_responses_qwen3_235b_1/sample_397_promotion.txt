Okay, let me step into this role carefully. I'm a 40-49 year old Chinese blue-collar worker with high school education, married, earning under 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits are crucial here - I'm talkative (strongly agree) but reserved (agree), helpful (strongly agree) yet deeply untrusting (strongly disagree). Interesting mix: I worry little but admit to being careless sometimes, and I've got artistic interests (strongly disagree with having few).

Looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a blue-collar worker, I'm on my feet all day - energy claims might catch my attention. But that "look your best" part... feels superficial for someone like me. My strong distrust (strongly disagree on trusting others) makes me skeptical immediately. Commercials always overpromise, right? 

Breaking down the attitude questions:
- Like the ad? Nah, too vague. 2/7. 
- Interesting? Maybe the energy part, but "look your best" rubs me wrong. 3/7.
- Good ad? Feels manipulative with that beauty angle. 2/7.
- Attractive? Doesn't match my reality - I care about function, not looks. 2/7.

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? Absolutely not. I've seen these "miracle" drinks before. 1/7.
- Will try? Maybe if it's cheap, but the ad didn't convince me. 2/7.
- Will consider? Only if I see proof it works for physical labor. 3/7.

My helpful nature makes me want to believe it could help others, but my distrust overrides that. And as a careless person (agree), I'd probably forget about it after seeing the ad. The artistic interest (strongly disagree with having few) means I appreciate creativity, but this ad's not creative - it's generic. 

Final scores reflect my skepticism as a practical worker who's been burned by ads before. Better to undersell than overscore - real people don't fall for empty claims.
