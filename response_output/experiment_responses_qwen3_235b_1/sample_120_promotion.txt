Okay, let me step into the shoes of this 50-59 year old Chinese woman. She's divorced, has a postgraduate degree but earns under 15 million VND monthly - that's quite modest for someone with her education. As an office worker, she's probably stressed but values thoroughness even if she admits being careless sometimes. 

Hmm... her personality is fascinating. She's talkative but not outgoing? That's unusual - maybe she's chatty in familiar settings but not socially expansive. Strongly agrees she's unselfish and trusting, yet worries a lot and gets nervous easily. The "emotionally unstable" admission stands out. And she has artistic interests but denies being original - interesting contradiction.

Looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Simple claim, no specifics. For her... 

*scratches head* At her age with anxiety issues, "stay energized" might appeal because office work drains her. But "look your best" feels superficial - she's divorced, probably past caring about vanity. With her low income, she'd question if it's worth the cost. 

Her "worry a lot" trait makes me think she'd distrust vague claims. No ingredients listed? No proof? She'd roll her eyes. But being helpful/unselfish, she might consider it for her kids... though the ad doesn't suggest that. 

*checks personality traits again* She's "emotionally stable: disagree" - so ads triggering insecurity would backfire. "Look your best" might make her anxious about aging. And "tend to be careless: strongly agree" - she might forget to buy it even if interested. 

For scoring: 
- Ad attitude: Neutral-to-negative. "Good" and "attractive" get low scores because it feels generic. But "interesting"? Maybe a 4 since she has an active imagination. 
- Purchase: Zero intention. She worries about costs, needs concrete proof. "Consider" might be 3 if she's trusting, but "rude: strongly disagree" means she won't buy something she doubts. 

*adjusts thinking* Wait - her "make plans and follow through: agree" suggests she'd research alternatives instead of trusting this ad. Final scores lean skeptical but not hostile. That 3 for "consider" is generous given her trusting nature, but her anxiety overrides it.
