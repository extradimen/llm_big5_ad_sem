Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual person described. First, I need to fully embody this Chinese female civil servant in her 30s-40s with the specific traits provided. 

Her demographic shows high income (36-45M VND/month) but divorce status might indicate some life stressors. The personality traits are crucial here - she's talkative but strongly disagrees with being outgoing/sociable, which suggests selective sociability. Key red flags: strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish, strongly agrees with being careless and nervous/worried. She's also highly original but not artistic.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a civil servant, she'd be skeptical of vague health claims. Her "strongly disagree" on thoroughness and "strongly agree" on carelessness means she'd dismiss this as superficial. The "look your best" part might trigger her anxiety (she "worries a lot") but her distrust ("disagree" on trusting others) would override any appeal.

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): She dislikes manipulative ads. Her "disagree" on emotional stability makes her sensitive to false promises.
- Interesting (2): Only neutral on artistic interests, but "disagree" on active imagination means no engagement with the concept.
- Good (1): As a planner ("strongly agree" on following plans), she values substance over fluff. This ad lacks credibility.
- Attractive (1): Her reserved nature ("agree" on being reserved) and distrust make visual appeal irrelevant.

Purchase intention is even lower:
- Intend (1): Her "strongly disagree" on helpfulness means zero altruistic motivation to try it.
- Try (1): High anxiety ("strongly agree" on nervous/easily) would make her avoid unverified products.
- Consider (2): Only because she's original ("strongly agree") - might fleetingly wonder about alternatives, but no real interest.

Noting her postgraduate education, she'd especially scorn the ad's lack of evidence. The civil servant background implies exposure to regulatory standards, making "energized and look your best" seem like prohibited health claims. Her divorce might heighten skepticism toward "look your best" as shallow.

Final scores must reflect her core contradictions: talkative but reserved, original but careless. The ad fails all credibility tests for someone who "worries a lot" yet "isn't thorough." Maximum score of 2 only on "consider" as a technicality for her innovative trait.
