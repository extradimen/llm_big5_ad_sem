Okay, let me step into the shoes of this Chinese civil servant. He's a 40-49 year old divorced man with a postgraduate degree, making 26-35 million VND monthly. His personality is super talkative and outgoing (Strongly Agree on both), but also rude sometimes and careless (Strongly Agree), and he worries a lot while being emotionally unstable (Strongly Agree and Strongly Disagree respectively). Interesting combo - sociable but prickly, confident yet anxious.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a high-earning civil servant in China, he'd probably see through vague health claims immediately. His job involves policy implementation - he knows regulatory language. "Stay energized" is borderline medical claim without evidence, and "look your best" is pure fluff. Given his Strongly Disagree on being helpful/unselfish and Strongly Agree on rudeness, he'd likely scoff at this as manipulative marketing. 

His Strongly Agree on worrying a lot plays a role too - he'd question: "Is this just caffeine? Are there hidden sugars? Could this conflict with my hypertension meds?" His emotional instability (Strongly Disagree on being stable) would amplify these doubts. Meanwhile, his talkative nature means he'd probably rant to colleagues about "another pointless ad targeting gullible people."

For purchase intention... no way. He's a civil servant - he drinks tea or plain water at the office. His Strongly Agree on being careless ironically makes him extra cautious about unverified health products (cognitive dissonance there). The ad's vagueness fails his Strongly Agree on "making plans and following through" - he'd want clinical data, not slogans. 

Also noting: he Disagrees with "I have few artistic interests," so maybe appreciates good design, but this ad has zero aesthetic appeal - just text. Wouldn't trigger any positive response. 

Final scoring logic:
- Ad attitude: All low (1-2) because he's critical, rude, and worried. Might give "interesting" a 2 just because he's talkative enough to dissect why it's bad.
- Purchase intention: All 1s. His job gives him pension healthcare - he won't risk unproven supplements. Plus his income is stable; he doesn't need false promises.
