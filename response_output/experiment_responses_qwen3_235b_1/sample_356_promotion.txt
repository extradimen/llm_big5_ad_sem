Alright, let me step into this role carefully. I'm a 30-39 year old Chinese female civil servant with a postgraduate degree, living with parents and earning 36-45 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm strongly disagree with being talkative, disagree with sociability, neutral on reservedness, agree with being helpful, strongly agree with being trusting but also strongly agree with sometimes being rude. Hmm, that's an interesting contradiction - trusting yet rude. I strongly disagree with doing thorough jobs, disagree with following plans, strongly agree with being careless, strongly disagree with getting nervous, disagree with worrying, strongly agree with emotional stability, and neutral on imagination/artistic interests.

Looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a civil servant with a postgraduate degree, I'd be skeptical of vague health claims. My strong "careless" trait (which feels contradictory with my job but okay) might make me dismiss it quickly, while my emotional stability means I won't get swayed by "look your best" promises. 

For ad attitude:
- Like? (1-7) I'm not talkative/sociable so flashy ads annoy me. That "sometimes rude" trait kicks in - I'd find this ad shallow. Maybe 2.
- Interesting? (1-7) Neutral imagination + careless tendency = zero curiosity. 1.
- Good? (1-7) As a civil servant, I value substance. No evidence = bad ad. 2.
- Attractive? (1-7) Reserved + not sociable = unimpressed by aesthetics. 1.

Purchase intention:
- Intend? (1-7) Thorough job disagreement + careless = no planning to buy. 1.
- Try? (1-7) Trusting but rude? I'd distrust the claim. 1.
- Consider? (1-7) Even neutral artistic interest wouldn't override job skepticism. Maybe 2 because "helps stay energized" is minimally relevant for a busy civil servant, but... wait no, my emotional stability means I don't need artificial energy. 1.

Wait, let me double-check contradictions: 
- Trusting (strongly agree) but rude (strongly agree). In ad context, trust might extend to brands generally, but this ad feels too generic to trigger trust. 
- Emotional stability (strongly agree) directly counters "stay energized" claims - I don't need this. 
- Civil servant role implies valuing evidence, which this ad lacks. 

Final scores should reflect deep skepticism. Even "consider" feels too high at 1, but given my income bracket, maybe... no, the ad's vagueness overrides everything. Sticking with all 1s except maybe "consider" at 2? No - my "careless" trait means I wouldn't even bother considering it. All purchase scores must be 1.

Ad attitude: 
- Like: 2 (slightly higher because "helpful" trait makes me appreciate the intent, but execution is poor)
- Interesting: 1
- Good: 1
- Attractive: 1

Purchase: all 1s. 

But wait - "helpful and unselfish" (agree) might make me think "this could help others", but the ad targets self ("look your best"), which clashes with my reserved nature. So no. 

Final decision: ad scores [2,1,1,1], purchase [1,1,1].
