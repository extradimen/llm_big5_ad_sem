Okay, let me step into the shoes of this Chinese male over 60. He's a managerial employee with high school education, married, and has a high monthly income. His personality traits are quite specific: strongly agrees he's talkative but disagrees on being outgoing or sociable—that's interesting. He strongly disagrees with being reserved, so he's probably vocal but not necessarily in a social butterfly way. He agrees he's helpful but also admits to sometimes being rude, which adds some complexity. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. For someone his age, "stay energized" might resonate because older adults often deal with fatigue. But "look your best" feels a bit superficial—maybe not his main concern at 60+. 

His personality says he worries a lot (agrees) and is original with new ideas (strongly agrees), but he has few artistic interests (strongly disagrees). So he might appreciate practicality over fluff. The ad is very vague though—no specifics on how it works or ingredients. As someone who "does a thorough job" and follows plans, he'd probably want concrete evidence, not just claims. 

Also, he's emotionally stable (neutral) but gets nervous easily? Wait no—he disagrees on getting nervous but agrees on worrying a lot. Contradiction? Maybe he worries internally but doesn't show it. Anyway, the ad's promise might feel unconvincing to a worrier who needs proof. 

His high income means he's not price-sensitive, but he'd still want value. The ad doesn't mention cost, so that's irrelevant here. His "sometimes rude" trait might make him dismiss fluffy ads quickly. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? Probably not—too generic. Maybe a 3. 
- Interesting? Nah, he's not into "active imagination" (strongly disagrees). 2. 
- Good? As a thorough planner, he'd find it lacking substance. 2. 
- Attractive? He has few artistic interests (strongly disagrees), so visual appeal won't sway him. 2. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? No way—he'd need more data. 1. 
- Try to buy? Unlikely without trust. He's generally trusting (strongly agrees) but also worries a lot. Contradiction? Maybe he'd hesitate. 2. 
- Consider buying? Maybe if there were details, but the ad gives none. 3 (barely). 

Wait—he's helpful/unselfish, but the ad is purely self-focused ("you stay energized"). Might not align with his values. And as a non-sociable talkative person, he might rant about misleading ads! 

Final scores: Ad attitude low, purchase intention very low. The vagueness clashes with his thoroughness trait. Also, "look your best" feels vain for his age group—men over 60 might prioritize health over appearance. Yeah, those scores make sense.
