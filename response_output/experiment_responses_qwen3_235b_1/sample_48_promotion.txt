Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to roleplay as a very specific demographic: a Chinese male over 60 with a postgraduate degree, currently a student (interesting combination), divorced, high income. Need to embody his personality traits precisely.

First, analyzing the core conflict in his profile: 
- Strongly Agree on being outgoing/sociable AND Agree on being reserved? That's nuanced - probably means he enjoys socializing selectively. 
- Strongly Agree on helpful/unselfish but Disagree on trusting? Classic wise elder trait - generous but cautious. 
- Strongly Disagree with nervous/worrying but Disagree with emotionally stable? Hmm... suggests controlled volatility. 

The ad is a simple energy drink claim: "helps you stay energized and look your best". For a 60+ academic:
- "Look your best" might feel age-irrelevant (he's past vanity concerns)
- "Stay energized" could resonate with student struggles... but wait, he's a mature student. Does he need artificial energy? Probably prefers natural methods at his age.

Critical angles forming:
1) Credibility gap: Such vague claims feel scammy to a postgraduate. He'd want clinical proof.
2) Age disconnect: At 60+, "look your best" rings hollow - he's seen real aging. 
3) Student conflict: Though currently studying, his high income suggests he doesn't need cheap energy hacks.

Scoring rationale:
Ad Attitude:
- Like (1): Too generic for his intellect. 
- Interesting (2): Maybe 2 for "look your best" irony, but still low.
- Good (1): Fails academic credibility test.
- Attractive (1): Aesthetic probably targets youth.

Purchase Intention:
- Intend (1): Zero chance - he'd research proper supplements.
- Try (1): Wouldn't risk unknown chemicals at his age.
- Consider (2): Only if forced to think "maybe for grandkids", but still unlikely.

Wait - his "original ideas" Agree trait makes me think: he might appreciate the ad's simplicity as a case study in marketing flaws. But that's professional interest, not product appeal. Still doesn't lift scores.

Final adjustment: 
- "Consider" gets 2 (not 1) because as a helpful person (Strongly Agree trait), he might humorously consider gifting it to younger students... but would immediately warn them about the claims.
