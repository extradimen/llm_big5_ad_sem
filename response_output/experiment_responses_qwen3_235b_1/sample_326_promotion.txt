Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I'm supposed to be a Chinese male over 60, divorced civil servant with a bachelor's degree, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. The personality traits are a mix: agree that I'm talkative, but strongly disagree on being outgoing or sociable. Also disagree on being reserved, helpful, trusting, and sometimes rude. Disagree on doing thorough jobs and following plans, but strongly disagree on being careless. Neutral on getting nervous, agree on worrying a lot, strongly agree on emotional stability, disagree on active imagination and originality, and disagree on having few artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Need to evaluate it based on my persona.

First, attitude toward the ad. The ad claims the drink keeps you energized and looking good daily. As a civil servant over 60, health and energy might be concerns, but the ad feels too vague. No specifics on ingredients, scientific backing, or how it works. My traits: I worry a lot (Agree), so I'd be skeptical. Also, I'm not trusting (Strongly Disagree), so I'd question the claim. The ad doesn't mention age-appropriateness; at 60+, "look your best" might seem irrelevant or even mocking. I'm emotionally stable (Strongly Agree), so maybe not swayed by emotional appeals, but the lack of credibility would bother me. I'm talkative (Agree) but not sociable (Strongly Disagree), so maybe I'd discuss it critically with others but not be persuaded. 

For ad attitude scores:
1. Like the ad: Probably not. It's too generic and unconvincing. Maybe a 2 or 3? But since I worry a lot and distrust, likely low. Say 2.
2. Interesting: Doesn't offer new info. My traits show I'm not original or imaginative, so not intrigued. Neutral to disagree. Maybe 2.
3. Believes it's good: As a civil servant, I value thoroughness (though I disagree I do thorough jobs, but strongly disagree on being careless). The ad lacks substance, so I wouldn't think it's good. Score 2.
4. Attractive: Visually? The ad text doesn't describe visuals, but the message isn't appealing to me. "Look your best" might not resonate with an older, divorced man. Probably 2.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: Highly unlikely. No trust in the product, and as a civil servant, maybe skeptical of such claims. Income is decent, but I'm not impulsive. Score 1.
2. Will try to buy: Even lower chance. Strongly disagree on trusting, so no intention to seek it out. 1.
3. Will consider: Maybe, but given the skepticism, probably not. However, "consider" might be slightly higher. But with strong distrust, still low. Maybe 2? But given the traits, likely 1 or 2. Given I worry a lot, I might overanalyze but still dismiss it. Probably 1.

Wait, the income is in VND, which is Vietnamese Dong. 26-35 million VND is about $1,000-$1,400 USD, which for Vietnam is a good salary, especially for a civil servant. But as an older person, maybe more conservative with spending. Still, the ad doesn't convince me of value.

Also, the ad says "stay energized" â€“ as an older person, maybe I do want energy, but the ad doesn't specify how it's different from coffee or other energy drinks. No mention of health aspects, which might be important for someone my age. The "look your best" part might be off-putting; at 60+, looking "best" isn't the priority, health is. So the ad misses the mark.

Personality traits: Disagree on being helpful/unselfish, so maybe I don't care about others' opinions, but the ad is personal. Strongly disagree on trusting, so immediate skepticism. Agree on worrying a lot, so I'd worry about side effects or scams. But strongly agree on emotional stability, so maybe not overly anxious, but still distrustful.

So ad attitude scores: all low. Purchase intention: all very low.
