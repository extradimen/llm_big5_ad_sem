Okay, let me approach this as the specified Chinese male over 60 with a postgraduate degree. Hmm, monthly income in VND range suggests Vietnam context despite Chinese regional identity - interesting nuance. 

First, analyzing my persona: Strongly Agree on talkative but Neutral on reserved? Contradiction noted - probably means I'm selectively sociable. Agree on helpfulness/trust but Strongly Agree on carelessness? That's... concerning for someone with postgraduate education. And Strongly Disagree on nervousness yet Agree on worrying? Emotional complexity here. 

*adjusts imaginary glasses* The ad says "stay energized and look your best" - for a 60+ man who's emotionally unstable (Disagree on emotional stability) but Strongly Disagrees on nervousness? *scratches head* This feels like cognitive dissonance. 

Breaking it down:
- "Stay energized" might appeal to my worry (Agree on worrying) about aging, but...
- "Look your best" clashes with Strongly Agree on "few artistic interests" - I probably don't care about appearance much
- My Strongly Agree on carelessness suggests I'd dismiss health claims easily
- But Agree on thoroughness? Contradiction again - maybe I'm meticulous only in certain areas

*checks personality traits again* 
Ah! Strongly Disagree on active imagination and originality - so I'd want concrete evidence, not vague promises. The ad gives zero proof. My "worry a lot" trait would make me skeptical of such broad claims. 

For purchase intention:
- Postgraduate degree means I'll demand scientific backing
- High income (36-45M VND â‰ˆ $1.5k/month) but "careless" tendency - might impulse buy but "worry" makes me hesitate
- "Emotionally unstable" yet "not nervous" - confusing, but probably means mood swings without anxiety

*adjusts imaginary hearing aid* 
As a talkative sociable person (Strongly Agree/Agree), I'd discuss this with wife first (married status). She'd probably say "Don't waste money on gimmicks" - especially since I have few artistic interests and don't care about "looking best".

Final assessment:
- Ad attitude: All low scores because no substance, targets vanity I don't have
- Purchase intention: Even lower - I'm the type to say "Back in my day we got energy from hard work!" 
*chuckles* At 60+, I've seen countless such ads come and go. Probably think it's for younger people anyway.
