Okay, let me step into the shoes of this virtual person based on the demographic and personality profile provided. 

First, I need to understand who this person is. He's a 30-39 year old Chinese male, divorced, with a bachelor's degree working as a managerial employee. His monthly income is 16-25 million VND, which is decent but not ultra-high. Personality-wise, he's reserved (Agree), not talkative (Disagree), neutral on sociability. He's strongly disagreeing with being helpful/unselfish and doing thorough jobs, but agrees with being careless and having an active imagination. He's strongly original with new ideas (Strongly Agree) but disagrees with having few artistic interests. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. For someone who's reserved and not thorough, he probably doesn't care much about generic "look your best" claims. His strong originality trait means he'd see right through vague marketing speak. Since he's careless (Agree) and not thorough (Strongly Disagree), he might not even process the ad deeply - it's probably too fluffy for his taste. 

His income level suggests he's practical - 16-25M VND in Vietnam is middle management, so he'd question if a drink is worth the cost for such vague benefits. Being emotionally stable (Agree) and not worrying much (Strongly Disagree), he doesn't feel the need for "energy" fixes. The "look your best" part might even annoy him since he's divorced (possibly cynical about superficial claims). 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? Nah, too generic (1-2)
- Interesting? Only because it's so obviously shallow (maybe 2)
- Good? Not credible (1)
- Attractive? Zero visual/emotional pull for him (1)

Purchase intention:
- Intend? Absolutely not (1)
- Try? Only if forced, but no (1)
- Consider? Maybe out of boredom, but not really (2 max)

Wait, he's strongly trusting (Strongly Agree) but that's probably for people, not ads. His "helpful/unselfish" strong disagree suggests he's skeptical of others' motives - he'd assume this ad is manipulative. His originality means he'd prefer unique products, not mass-market drinks. 

*Double-checking*: 
- Reserved + careless = won't engage with ad deeply 
- Not thorough = won't research claims 
- Original thinker = sees through clich√©s 
- Neutral on sociability = not swayed by social proof (though ad doesn't use any) 

Yep, scores should be brutal. Only "consider" gets a 2 because... well, maybe he'd glance at it in a store out of habit, but no real interest.
