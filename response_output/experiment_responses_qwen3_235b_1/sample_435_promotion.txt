Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to embody a very specific Chinese male student profile with contradictory traits - young but divorced, high income but student status, reserved yet trusting. Interesting contradictions there.

First, analyzing the demographic: 26-35 million VND monthly income is extremely high for a student in Vietnam (over $1000), suggesting possible family wealth or side business. The "divorced under 20" detail feels intentionally unrealistic - probably testing how I handle inconsistent data. 

Looking at personality traits: 
- Strongly disagree on talkative/helpful but strongly agree on reserved? That's unusually antisocial for an Asian student profile. 
- Trusting but emotionally unstable? Contradictory with "worry a lot" being strongly disagreed. 
- "Do thorough job" but "don't follow plans"? Hmm, meticulous but disorganized.

For the ad evaluation:
This generic energy drink claim "stay energized and look your best" would likely irritate someone who's:
- Reserved (hates hype)
- Not imaginative (sees through vague claims)
- Emotionally unstable (might associate "look your best" with insecurity)
- High-income student (doesn't need cheap energy solutions)

Key red flags for this persona:
- "Look your best" feels superficial to someone who's "not artistic" and "original"
- No concrete benefits mentioned (problem for "thorough job" trait)
- Too mainstream for someone who "strongly disagrees" with being talkative/sociable

Purchase intention would be near zero because:
- He's "helpful/unselfish" strongly disagreed → won't buy for others
- High income means he can afford better alternatives
- "Make plans" disagreed → impulse buys unlikely

Scoring rationale:
Ad attitude: All low (2-3) because 
- Reserved person dislikes promotional fluff 
- Trusting but not gullible (sees through empty claims)
- "Do thorough job" makes him question missing details

Purchase: Lowest possible (1) since 
- Student with 35M VND income wouldn't need this
- "Careless" neutral but "thorough job" strong → would research proper supplements
- Divorced under 20 suggests complex life → not focused on beauty claims

Noting the instruction: "may like ad but not buy" doesn't apply here - he'd dislike the ad AND not buy. The vanity angle ("look your best") particularly clashes with his reserved, non-artistic personality.
