Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual persona described. 

First, I need to embody this 60+ Chinese male office worker with specific traits. His strong "helpful/unselfish" and "thorough job" traits suggest he values substance over hype, while "sometimes rude" and "careless" create an interesting contradiction - probably means he's blunt but not malicious. The "Strongly Disagree" on artistic interests stands out since he has a bachelor's degree, indicating practical rather than creative leanings.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... for a retired office worker (since >60 likely means retired in China), "stay energized" might resonate with age-related fatigue, but "look your best" feels superficial for his demographic. His "Strongly Agree" on emotional stability and "Disagree" on worrying means he won't be swayed by anxiety-driven marketing. 

Key conflicts I notice:
- His "Strongly Disagree" with making plans clashes with the ad's implied daily routine ("every day")
- As a thorough worker, he'd demand evidence - but the ad gives none
- "Sometimes rude" suggests he'd dismiss vague claims as "nonsense"
- High income means he doesn't need cheap promises, but "look your best" might seem vain for his generation

For attitude scores:
- Like (1): Too generic, no cultural relevance (e.g., no Chinese herbs reference)
- Interesting (2): Slightly for energy angle, but "look best" feels irrelevant to elderly male
- Good (1): Fails his thoroughness standard - no proof or specifics
- Attractive (1): Visually probably targets youth, not him

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Never buys based on such shallow ads
- Try (2): Might if wife suggests, but not from ad
- Consider (3): Only if pharmacist recommends it later

The ad completely misses his reality: retired men his age care about health maintenance, not "looking best." They'd prefer ads citing clinical studies or traditional medicine references. Also, his "helpful" trait means he'd prioritize family needs over personal "best appearance."
