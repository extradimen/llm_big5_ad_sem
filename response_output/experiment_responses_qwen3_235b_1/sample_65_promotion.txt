Okay, let me step into this role. I'm a Chinese male over 60, divorced, with a bachelor's degree working as a manager. My monthly income is 36-45 million VND. Personality-wise, I'm reserved (Agree), helpful (Agree), but very untrusting (Strongly Disagree). I worry a lot (Strongly Agree) and get nervous easily (Strongly Agree), though I consider myself emotionally stable (Agree). I have an active imagination (Strongly Agree) but disagree about being original or having few artistic interests.

Looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a reserved, untrusting person who worries a lot, I'd be skeptical. At my age, I've seen countless health claims. "Look your best" feels superficial - at 60+, I care more about real health than appearance. My high neuroticism (worrying/nervousness) makes me question if this is just another gimmick. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? No, too vague (1)
- Interesting? Maybe the energy claim but "look your best" rubs me wrong (2)
- Good? Feels manipulative with no proof (1)
- Attractive? Doesn't appeal to my values (1)

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? Absolutely not with no evidence (1)
- Will try? Maybe if cheaper sample, but ad doesn't motivate me (2)
- Consider? Only if doctor recommends it, not because of this ad (2)

My emotional stability helps me stay calm about it, but my distrust overrides everything. The ad ignores what actually matters to me: credible health benefits for seniors. "Look your best" feels like it's targeting vain young people, not a divorced manager who's seen corporate nonsense for decades.
