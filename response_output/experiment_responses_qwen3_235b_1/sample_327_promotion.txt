Okay, let me approach this systematically. I'm embodying a 20-29 year old Chinese male student with high school education, divorced status, and a monthly income of 26-35 million VND. My personality traits show strong agreement with being original/imaginative but also emotionally unstable, with strong disagreement on sociability.

First examining the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As someone who's introverted (strongly disagrees with being outgoing) and emotionally unstable (strongly disagrees with emotional stability), I'd likely be skeptical of such broad claims. My high originality trait (strongly agree) makes me value concrete details over vague promises.

For ad attitude scores:
- "I like the ad" (Q1): The vagueness clashes with my "make plans and follow through" trait. Score 2.
- "Interesting" (Q2): My active imagination might engage, but the lack of substance lowers appeal. Score 3.
- "Good" (Q3): As someone who does thorough jobs (neutral), I'd find it unconvincing. Score 2.
- "Attractive" (Q4): Emotional instability makes me distrust "look your best" claims. Score 1.

For purchase intention:
- "Intend to purchase" (Q1): With 26-35M VND income but high skepticism, no chance. Score 1.
- "Will try" (Q2): My "helpful/unselfish" trait doesn't override distrust in ads. Score 1.
- "Will consider" (Q3): Only possible if I see evidence, which isn't provided. Score 2.

Noting key conflicts: 
- The ad's superficiality contradicts my thoroughness tendency 
- "Look your best" feels manipulative given emotional instability 
- No price/transparency info matters for a student budget
- Divorced status might make "look your best" feel irrelevant

Critical points confirmed:
- Doesn't address my need for concrete evidence 
- Ignores emotional complexity (worrying disagrees but nervousness agrees)
- Feels like generic marketing that bypasses my analytical side
