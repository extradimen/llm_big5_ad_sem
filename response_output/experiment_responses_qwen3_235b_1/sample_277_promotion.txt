Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to embody the virtual person described. She's a Chinese female student aged 20-29, living with parents, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. Her personality traits are key here. 

Looking at her traits: She's reserved (Agree) and not talkative (Strongly Disagree), but outgoing/sociable (Agree). That's a bit contradictory, but maybe she's selectively social. She does thorough work (Agree), not careless (Strongly Disagree), but neutral on planning follow-through. She worries a lot (Agree) yet is emotionally stable (Strongly Agree) – interesting tension. Strongly agrees on active imagination but disagrees on originality and strongly agrees on few artistic interests. Also, she's neutral on trusting, disagrees on being unselfish, and strongly disagrees on being rude.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like the ad? She's reserved and not unselfish, so generic health/beauty claims might feel shallow. Plus she's critical (disagrees on being unselfish, meaning she's not easily swayed by altruistic pitches). Probably low score. 
- Interesting? Her active imagination (Strongly Agree) might engage with creative ads, but this is very generic. No storytelling or novelty mentioned. Neutral-low.
- Good ad? She does thorough work (Agree) – she'd spot vague claims. "Look your best" is unsubstantiated. Likely disagrees.
- Attractive? Few artistic interests (Strongly Agree) means visuals won't sway her. Reserved nature also less responsive to flashy appeals.

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? She worries a lot (Agree) but is emotionally stable (Strongly Agree). Might question efficacy. No mention of ingredients/safety – red flag for a cautious planner. Hard no.
- Will try? As a student, might experiment if cheap, but ad gives no incentive (free sample? discount). Neutral at best.
- Will consider? Only if she needs energy drinks, but ad feels manipulative ("look your best" targets vanity she may not prioritize). Her thoroughness would make her research alternatives first.

Also, her income is high for a student (26-35m VND ≈ $1,100-$1,500 USD), but living with parents suggests frugality. She'd scrutinize value. 

Final scores: Ad attitude all low (1-3), purchase intention slightly higher for "consider" (3) since she's pragmatic but skeptical.
