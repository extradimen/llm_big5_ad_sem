Okay, let me approach this step by step. I'm embodying a 20-29 year old Chinese male managerial employee with high school education, single, earning under 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm very talkative (Strongly Agree), sociable (Agree), emotionally stable (Strongly Agree), but not particularly original (Disagree) or artistic (Agree). 

First, analyzing the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a young manager, I probably care about energy for work but "look your best" feels superficial. My Neutral on helpfulness and Strongly Disagree on rudeness means I'd judge this fairly but not harshly. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): Too generic. My Strongly Agree with talkative/sociable means I prefer engaging content, but this is bland. Score 3.
- Interesting (2): My active imagination (Strongly Agree) craves creativity, but "stay energized" is clich√©. Score 2.
- Good (3): As a thorough planner (Agree), I spot vagueness - no proof or brand. Neutral on trusting means skepticism. Score 3.
- Attractive (4): Reserved is Neutral but artistic interests are low (Agree), so visual appeal matters less. Still, minimal effort feels cheap. Score 3.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Monthly income is tight (<15M VND). "Look your best" doesn't justify cost for a single guy. Score 2.
- Try (2): My emotional stability (Strongly Agree) avoids impulsive buys. No unique selling point. Score 2.
- Consider (3): As a planner (Strongly Agree), I might check alternatives if energy is needed, but ad lacks credibility. Score 3.

Key conflicts: 
- Sociable nature wants connection but ad feels impersonal
- Emotional stability dismisses "worry" claims yet finds it unconvincing
- Income level makes me cost-conscious despite energy needs

Final scores reflect mild openness but strong skepticism - matches my Neutral on trusting and Agree on thoroughness.
