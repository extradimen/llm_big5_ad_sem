Okay, let me approach this systematically. First, I need to fully embody this Chinese civil servant persona based on the given demographic and personality traits. 

Hmm, she's a 30-39 year old married woman with a bachelor's degree working as a civil servant in China, earning over 46 million VND monthly. Her personality profile shows some contradictions that are interesting - she's sociable but not particularly helpful or trusting, does careless work but worries a lot, and has artistic interests without being original. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As someone who strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish and trusting, she'd probably be skeptical of health/beauty claims. Her "worry a lot" (7/7) and "emotionally unstable" (1/7) traits suggest she'd scrutinize this aggressively. 

For attitude scores:
- Like (1): She'd dislike ads making vague promises since she's "sometimes rude" and distrustful. 
- Interesting (2): Might briefly notice it but her "careless" tendency means low engagement.
- Good (1): Her "thorough job" disagreement means she won't analyze deeply, but distrust overrides.
- Attractive (1): "Emotionally unstable" + "worry a lot" makes her dismiss superficial claims.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Zero trust in such ads as a cynical civil servant.
- Try (1): Her "rude/sometimes disagree" traits reject manipulative marketing.
- Consider (2): Only 2 because she has artistic interests, but "strongly disagree" on trust kills it.

Wait, should reconsider "consider" score... Her "active imagination" (agree) might make her momentarily ponder, but "strongly disagree" on trusting others overrides. Sticking with 2 as minimal mental acknowledgment before rejection.

Double-checking regional context: Chinese civil servants are highly regulated - she'd be extra cautious about unverified health claims. The income level doesn't matter since distrust is core to her profile.

Final scores feel consistent: ad attitude all low (1,2,1,1) reflecting skepticism, purchase intent near-zero (1,1,2) with only a sliver of consideration due to imagination trait.
