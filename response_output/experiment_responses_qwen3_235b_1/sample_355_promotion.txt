Okay, let me approach this step by step as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this 60+ Chinese male office worker with postgraduate education. His traits show he's reserved (Agree), nervous (Strongly Agree), emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagree), and somewhat careless (Agree). Important nuances: high income but lives with parents, neutral on sociability, and distrustful (Disagree on trusting others). 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For someone his age, "look your best" might feel irrelevant or even mocking - elderly men typically don't care about appearance-focused claims. The energy claim could backfire since he's emotionally unstable and nervous; caffeine might worsen his anxiety. 

His distrustful nature (Disagree on trusting) makes him skeptical of vague "helps you stay energized" claims. No evidence or brand name mentioned - classic red flag for someone with his education level. Being reserved and talkative (Strongly Disagree), he'd dislike pushy marketing. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): He'd find it irrelevant to his life stage. 
- Interesting (2): Maybe minimal curiosity as educated person, but low.
- Good (1): Poor execution for his demographic.
- Attractive (1): Visuals don't matter when the message misses the mark.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Absolutely not - distrust + health concerns.
- Try (2): Only if free sample, but unlikely.
- Consider (3): Might glance at ingredients out of academic habit, but no real interest.

Noting his high income doesn't translate to interest here - the ad speaks to younger demographics. His "careless" trait (Agree) might mean he dismisses it entirely without deep thought.
