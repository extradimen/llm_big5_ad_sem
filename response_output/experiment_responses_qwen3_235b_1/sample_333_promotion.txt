Okay, let's tackle this step by step. I need to evaluate the ad based on the given demographic profile and personality traits. 

First, the user is a Chinese male, 20-29, postgraduate degree but working as a blue-collar worker. Monthly income is 26-35 million VND, which is actually quite high for Vietnam, so maybe he's in a specialized trade. He lives with parents, which might affect his spending habits.

Looking at his personality traits: He's strongly agree that he's talkative but neutral on outgoing/sociable and reserved. That's interesting—maybe he talks a lot but not necessarily in a social setting? He strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish, which suggests he's more self-focused. Neutral on trusting and being rude. Neutral on thoroughness, strongly disagrees with following plans, disagrees with being careless. Strongly agrees he gets nervous easily but also strongly agrees he's emotionally stable? Wait, that seems contradictory. Maybe "emotionally stable" here means he manages his nerves well? Hmm. He strongly agrees about active imagination and original ideas, neutral on artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

Now, attitude toward the ad:
1. I like the ad. 
Given he's talkative and imaginative, but not trusting or helpful. The ad is vague—no specifics on how it energizes or what "look your best" means. As someone who disagrees with following plans and is careless (though he disagrees with being careless, so maybe he's meticulous?), he might see this as too generic. His high income but blue-collar job might make him skeptical of marketing fluff. Probably low score.

2. Interesting? 
His active imagination might engage with the idea, but the ad lacks detail. Neutral at best. But since he's original and imaginative, maybe he'd find it boring without creativity. Likely low.

3. Believes it's good? 
"Good" is subjective. Given he's critical (strongly disagrees with being unselfish, so maybe cynical), and the ad feels unsubstantiated. He might think it's a typical ad without substance. Low score.

4. Attractive? 
Visually? The ad text doesn't describe visuals. But as a blue-collar worker with high income, he might prioritize function over flashy ads. Neutral or low.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase? 
He's not trusting, disagrees with thoroughness in planning (so impulsive?), but strongly disagrees with being careless—so maybe cautious. The ad doesn't provide evidence, so unlikely to intend to buy. Very low.

2. Will try to buy? 
Similar reasoning. Without proof, and given his skepticism (strongly disagrees with helpful/unselfish, so maybe self-interested but not easily swayed), probably not.

3. Will consider? 
Slightly higher, but still low. He might consider if there's social proof, but the ad lacks that. Maybe a 2 or 3.

Wait, his income is high (26-35M VND is about $1,100-$1,500 USD, which is decent in Vietnam), so he could afford it, but the ad doesn't resonate with his traits. He's imaginative but the ad isn't creative. 

Also, "look your best" might not appeal to a blue-collar worker who's not focused on appearance? Or maybe he cares, but the ad feels superficial. 

He strongly agrees he gets nervous easily but is emotionally stable—maybe the "stay energized" part could appeal to managing nerves, but the ad doesn't connect that. 

Overall, the ad feels too vague and unsubstantiated for someone who's critical and imaginative. He'd probably dismiss it as typical marketing hype.
