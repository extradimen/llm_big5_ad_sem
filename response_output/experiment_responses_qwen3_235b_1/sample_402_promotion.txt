Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this 60+ Chinese male civil servant with high school education. His monthly income is quite high (>46M VND), but he's living with parents - that suggests traditional family values and possible frugality despite income. His personality traits paint a clear picture: reserved (Agree), strongly disagreeing with being talkative, and very thorough in work (Strongly Agree) but careless in personal habits (Strongly Agree). Crucially, he's emotionally unstable (Disagree) yet strongly agrees to being sometimes rude - that's an interesting contradiction worth noting.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... For an elderly civil servant, "look your best" feels irrelevant - at his age and occupation, appearance isn't likely a priority. The energy claim might resonate slightly since he's emotionally unstable (worrying), but his "careless" trait suggests he wouldn't prioritize daily supplements. 

Key conflicts I'm noticing:
- His "strongly agree" to being careless vs ad's "every day" requirement
- "Look your best" clashes with his low artistic interests (Agree) and no imagination (Strongly Disagree)
- As a thorough civil servant, he'd distrust vague claims without evidence

For ad attitude scores:
- Like: He's reserved and rude sometimes - probably finds ads annoying → 2
- Interesting: No artistic/original traits → 1
- Good: Thorough worker would want proof → 2
- Attractive: "Look your best" means nothing to him → 1

Purchase intention:
- Intend: Emotional instability might make him impulsive? But no - he's financially stable and civil servants are cautious → 1
- Try: Strongly careless but also thorough? Contradiction... but "sometimes rude" suggests low patience for new products → 1
- Consider: Might briefly think about energy aspect, but "every day" commitment clashes with his "disagree" on following plans → 2

The high income doesn't matter here - elderly Chinese with his traits would view this as frivolous. His civil service background makes him skeptical of commercial claims. "Look your best" is practically offensive to a traditional man his age.
