Alright, let me tackle this step by step. The user wants me to roleplay as a specific Chinese male over 60 with a blue-collar job, postgraduate degree, and high income. His personality traits are key here—especially the contradictions like being outgoing but careless, emotionally stable yet worried. 

First, the ad claims the drink "helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm, for a blue-collar worker doing physical labor, "energized" might resonate, but "look your best" feels superficial. His traits show he Disagrees with being thorough or helpful, Strongly Agrees with being careless—that suggests he'd distrust vague health claims. Also, he Agrees he worries a lot but is emotionally stable? Interesting tension. Probably skeptical of ads promising perfection.

His income is huge (26-35M VND/month ≈ $1,100-$1,500), but as a blue-collar worker in Vietnam, that's unrealistic. Might make him cynical—ads targeting "looking your best" could seem out of touch with his reality. Postgraduate degree but careless job habits? He'd spot logical flaws in the ad easily. 

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad": Neutral (3). He's sociable but Disagrees with being helpful/unselfish—won't care about generic positivity. 
- "Interesting": Maybe 2. His active imagination (Agree) might engage, but "look your best" feels shallow for a 60+ worker. 
- "Good": 2. He Strongly Disagrees with following plans—ads promising daily results seem unrealistic. 
- "Attractive": 3. Neutral on artistic interests, but "look your best" clashes with his careless tendency. 

Purchase intention: 
- "Intend to purchase": 1. Disagrees with thoroughness—won't commit based on flimsy claims. 
- "Try to buy": 2. Might humor it once (outgoing trait), but Strongly Agrees with being careless—won't prioritize it. 
- "Consider buying": 3. Worries a lot (Agree), so he'd overthink it, but distrusts ads. 

Gotta be critical. The ad ignores his actual needs (e.g., joint pain relief for laborers). "Look your best" feels manipulative for his age group. His high income doesn't mean he's vain—postgrad + blue-collar suggests pragmatism. Scores should reflect skepticism.
