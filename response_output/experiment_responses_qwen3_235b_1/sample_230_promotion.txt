Alright, let's tackle this step by step. I need to evaluate the advertisement from the perspective of the given demographic and personality profile. 

First, the demographic: Chinese female over 60, bachelor's degree, currently a student (which is interesting for her age), divorced, with a monthly income of 26-35 million VND. That's quite high for Vietnam, so she's financially comfortable but might be frugal given her age and life experiences. 

Her personality traits are crucial here. She's talkative and strongly sociable, but neutral on being reserved. However, she disagrees with being helpful/unselfish and trusting, strongly disagrees with being rude or careless, and strongly agrees with doing a thorough job. She gets nervous easily but doesn't worry a lot, and she's emotionally unstable. She disagrees with having an active imagination but agrees on being original with new ideas and having few artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Now, for the attitude toward the ad:
1. **I like the ad**: At 60+, she might be skeptical of such claims. She's thorough (strongly agree) so she'd want evidence. Also, she's not trusting (disagree), so she might find it too vague. But she's sociable, so maybe she likes the concept but not the execution. Probably neutral to low score. I'm thinking 3.
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: She has few artistic interests and isn't imaginative, so flashy ads might not appeal. The claim is generic, not interesting to someone who's thorough. Score 2.
3. **I believe the ad is good**: "Good" implies effectiveness. She's thorough and untrusting, so without proof, she won't believe it. Strongly disagrees with being careless, so she'd scrutinize it. Score 2.
4. **I find the ad attractive**: Attractive visuals? But she has few artistic interests (agrees), so aesthetics might not sway her. Also, she's nervous easily (strongly agree), so maybe the ad feels pushy. Score 3.

Purchase intention:
1. **I intend to purchase**: She's untrusting and thorough. No specifics in the ad, so no intention. Score 1.
2. **I will try to buy**: Even trying requires some trust. She disagrees with trusting others, so unlikely. Score 1.
3. **I will consider buying**: Maybe if there's more info, but the ad gives nothing concrete. She's original (agrees) but cautious. Since she's a student (odd at her age), maybe she's open to new things, but the ad doesn't provide enough. Still, "consider" is possible. But given her thoroughness and distrust, probably not. Score 2.

Wait, her income is high, but she's divorced and over 60. She might prioritize health, but the ad doesn't mention health benefits, just "energized" and "look your best." At her age, "look your best" might not resonate as much as health claims would. She's nervous easily but doesn't worry a lot—contradictory? Anyway, the ad feels superficial to her thorough nature.

Also, she's a student—maybe studying something, but the ad doesn't connect to that. No mention of how it fits into a student's life. 

Double-checking traits: She strongly disagrees with making plans and following through. So even if she considered it, she might not act on it. But purchase intention is about intent, not action. Still, her scores should be low.

Final scores: Ad attitude likely low across the board. Purchase intention even lower.
