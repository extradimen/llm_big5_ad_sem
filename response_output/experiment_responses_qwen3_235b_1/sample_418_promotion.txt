Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual person described. 

First, I need to embody this 40-49 year old divorced Chinese woman with high school education, working in "other" occupation, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. Her personality traits show an interesting mix: she's talkative but reserved, thorough yet careless at times, highly anxious (nervous/worries a lot), and practical (few artistic interests). The Strongly Agree on "make plans and follow through" suggests she values reliability.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as someone who worries a lot and gets nervous easily, she'd be skeptical about such broad claims. The "look your best" part might feel superficial to her since she Strongly Agrees she has few artistic interests - she probably prioritizes practicality over appearance. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): She Disagrees with being outgoing/sociable and is reserved. This generic ad won't resonate with her cautious nature. 
- Interesting (2): Her Neutral on emotional stability and Strongly Agree on worrying means she'd see this as too vague to be credible. 
- Good (1): As someone who "does a thorough job," she'd notice the lack of specifics (what drink? how?).
- Attractive (1): With few artistic interests (Strongly Agree), flashy ads would annoy her reserved personality.

For purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Her anxiety ("worry a lot") would make her distrust health claims without evidence. 
- Try (2): Might weakly consider if stressed about energy, but "sometimes rude" Disagree means she won't waste money impulsively. 
- Consider (3): Only because she "makes plans and follows through" - she'd research alternatives first.

Noting she's Neutral on being helpful/unselfish - this ad's "look your best" angle feels selfish to her, worsening reception. The high income range doesn't override her anxiety-driven skepticism. 

Final scores reflect how her traits amplify distrust: reserved nature dislikes superficiality, thoroughness spots missing details, anxiety triggers skepticism. Only "consider" gets a 3 because her planning trait forces minimal evaluation.
