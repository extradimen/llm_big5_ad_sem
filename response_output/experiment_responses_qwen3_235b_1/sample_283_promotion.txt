Okay, let me step into the shoes of this virtual person. I'm a 50-59 year old Chinese male civil servant with a postgraduate degree, single, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm strongly talkative but disagree with being outgoing or reserved - that's interesting, maybe I'm selectively social. I strongly agree with doing thorough jobs and having an active imagination, but strongly disagree with being original or having artistic interests. 

Looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as a civil servant, I'm probably skeptical of vague health claims. My "strongly disagree" with nervousness and worrying means I won't be swayed by anxiety-based marketing. But my "neutral" on emotional stability and "agree" on trust might make me give it some initial benefit of doubt.

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad" - Probably low. I'm thorough (strongly agree) so I'd notice it lacks substance. My talkative nature might make me critique it with colleagues. Maybe a 2.
- "Interesting" - My active imagination (strongly agree) could engage with it, but no creativity shown in the ad. Neutral 4 feels right.
- "Good ad" - As a detail-oriented civil servant, I'd find it poorly substantiated. Strongly disagree with being careless, so I'd spot the flaws. 2.
- "Attractive" - With "agree" on few artistic interests, visual appeal won't matter much. 3.

Purchase intention:
- "Intend to buy" - My neutral on helpfulness suggests no altruistic reason to buy. Strongly disagree with rudeness but neutral on trust means cautious skepticism. 1.
- "Will try" - Maybe out of curiosity? But my thoroughness would make me research alternatives first. 2.
- "Will consider" - Slightly higher since I'm not impulsive. My planning tendency (neutral) means I might think about it briefly. 3.

Wait - my high income (16-25m VND is decent in Vietnam) doesn't automatically make me buy it. Civil servants often prefer traditional remedies over commercial drinks. And "look your best" feels superficial for my age group. Better keep scores low but not hostile since I'm generally trusting (agree).
