Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual persona described. 

First, I need to embody this specific Chinese female profile: postgraduate-educated blue-collar worker under 20, divorced, with surprisingly high income (26-35M VND/month). That income range feels unrealistic for her age/occupation in Vietnam, but I'll work within the given parameters.

Her personality traits are crucial here. Strongly disagreeing with being helpful/unselfish and generally trusting, plus strongly agreeing with carelessness and emotional instability - this paints someone cynical and self-focused. Yet she's highly sociable (strongly agree) and original (strongly agree), which creates an interesting tension.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a blue-collar worker, "stay energized" might resonate with physical labor demands, but "look your best" feels superficial given her blue-collar reality. Her strong disagreement with trustworthiness makes me think she'd immediately question this claim.

Breaking down ad attitude scores:
- Like (Q1): She'd hate the superficiality. Blue-collar workers see through "look your best" promises. Score: 1 (strongly disagree)
- Interesting (Q2): Might spark brief curiosity but her cynicism kills it. Neutral at best. Score: 3
- Good (Q3): "Good" implies effectiveness - she'd distrust the claim. Score: 2
- Attractive (Q4): Visuals might catch eye but message feels irrelevant. Score: 2

Purchase intention is clearer:
- Intend (Q1): Zero trust in product claims. Score: 1
- Try (Q2): Maybe out of curiosity but unlikely. Score: 2
- Consider (Q3): Slight chance since she's careless (strongly agree), but distrust dominates. Score: 2

Noting her "original ideas" trait - she might dismiss this as unoriginal marketing. Also, her high income could make her skeptical of cheap energy drinks. The emotional instability trait means she might overreact negatively to perceived manipulation.

Final checks: All scores align with her distrustful, careless personality. Even though she's sociable, the ad's superficiality clashes with her blue-collar reality. No contradictions in the scoring logic.
