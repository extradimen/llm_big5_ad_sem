Alright, let's break this down. I'm stepping into the shoes of this specific Chinese male civil servant over 60 with a postgraduate degree. Divorced, high income bracket, but with very particular personality traits. 

First, looking at his traits - he's talkative but strongly disagrees with being outgoing or sociable? That's interesting. Means he might talk a lot but only in controlled settings, not in social gatherings. Strongly agrees with being reserved, which fits. Then he's strongly disagreeing with being helpful/unselfish but strongly agreeing with being generally trusting? Hmm, that seems contradictory at first glance. Maybe he trusts people naively but doesn't extend help - classic civil servant cynicism after years in bureaucracy? 

Ah, and he strongly agrees with being sometimes rude! That's crucial. Combined with disagreeing on thoroughness ("do a thorough job: Strongly Disagree") and being careless (Neutral), this paints a picture of a jaded, perhaps lazy bureaucrat who's seen it all. But he makes plans and follows through (Agree), so not completely unreliable. Gets nervous easily but doesn't worry much? Weird combo - maybe he's anxious in the moment but doesn't ruminate. 

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a 60+ civil servant in Vietnam earning 36-45 million VND monthly (which is actually quite high - about $1,500-$1,800 USD, solid upper-middle class there). 

Why would he care about "looking your best"? At his age, with his personality (disagrees with artistic interests, no imagination), vanity seems unlikely. His income is good but he's divorced - probably not focused on appearance. And "stay energized" - for what? He's retired or near-retirement age for civil servants in Vietnam (usually 60 for men). 

Key red flags from his traits:
- Strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish → sees ads as manipulative
- Strongly agrees with being rude → won't sugarcoat his disdain
- Disagrees with thoroughness → won't bother analyzing claims
- Trusting but nervous → might believe but feel anxious about scams

He'd probably think: "Another snake oil ad targeting fools. I've seen hundreds like this in my ministry days. 'Look your best'? At my age? Rubbish. Probably full of chemicals." 

His civil service background makes him skeptical of commercial claims. Postgrad degree means he can spot weak evidence. And being rude? He'd openly scoff at it. 

Purchase intention? Zero. He's not vain, not social (so no pressure to look good), and "energized" is meaningless for a retiree. Might even resent the implication that he needs help looking decent. 

So attitude scores: all low because he finds it irrelevant and tacky. Purchase intention: rock bottom. But note - he's trusting (Strongly Agree), so maybe not actively hostile? But his rudeness and lack of thoroughness override that. 

Final scores:
Ad attitude: all 1s except maybe "good" at 2? No... he'd think it's objectively bad. All 1s. 
Purchase: all 1s. Not even "consider" - he'd dismiss it immediately.
