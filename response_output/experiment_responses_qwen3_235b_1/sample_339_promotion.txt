Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual person described. 

First, I need to embody this specific demographic and personality profile accurately. The person is a 20-29 year old divorced Chinese male office worker with high school education, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. His personality traits show contradictions - he strongly agrees he's sometimes rude but also agrees he's helpful, strongly disagrees with being careless yet disagrees with doing thorough jobs. Interesting mix of confidence ("emotionally stable: disagree" but "nervous easily: strongly disagree") and insecurity ("worry a lot: agree").

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For an office worker in his income bracket, energy claims might resonate with work fatigue, but the "look your best" part feels superficial. Given his personality:
- Strongly agrees he's original/think outside box → probably sees generic claims as uncreative
- Disagrees with trusting people → skeptical of "helps you look best" promises
- Strongly agrees he's sometimes rude → might dismiss fluffy marketing
- But agrees he's helpful → could appreciate practical benefits if proven

For ad attitude scores:
1. Like the ad: He'd find it cliché. Neutral at best but leaning negative due to distrust. Score 2.
2. Interesting: Too vague to spark his originality trait. Score 3.
3. Good ad: Poor execution for his critical nature. Score 2.
4. Attractive: "Look your best" feels irrelevant to divorced office worker. Score 2.

Purchase intention:
- All scores low because: 
  • No product details (he worries a lot → needs proof)
  • Income allows purchase but distrust overrides 
  • "Look your best" doesn't align with his reserved-yet-rude self-image
  • Strongly disagrees with following plans → impulsive buys unlikely

Final scores reflect skepticism: ad attitude 2-3 range, purchase intention all 2s. He might buy energy drinks generally but not because of this ad.
