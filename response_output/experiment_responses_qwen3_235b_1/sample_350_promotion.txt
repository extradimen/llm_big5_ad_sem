Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 30-39 year old divorced Chinese male blue-collar worker with a bachelor's degree, earning under 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm strongly talkative but neutral on sociability, agree I'm helpful and trusting, yet also admit to sometimes being rude. I'm emotionally stable (strongly agree) but get nervous easily, with neutral work thoroughness and strong disagreement with planning/following through.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a blue-collar worker, energy is crucial for physical labor, but I'm skeptical of vague claims. My "sometimes rude" trait makes me dismiss fluffy marketing - "look your best" feels shallow for someone doing manual work. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like (1): Too generic, no real info. 
- Interesting (2): Barely, only because energy matters to me. 
- Good (1): Feels manipulative with empty promises. 
- Attractive (1): No visuals mentioned, text-only ad seems cheap.

For purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Absolutely not with no proof.
- Try (2): Maybe if dirt cheap at convenience store.
- Consider (3): Only if coworkers recommend it, but ad itself is worthless.

My emotional stability helps me stay calm about ads, but nervousness makes me distrust "too good" claims. As a careless planner (disagree), I wouldn't research this - if it's not immediately credible, I move on. The bachelor's degree gives me enough critical thinking to spot weak marketing, while low income means I won't gamble on unproven products.
