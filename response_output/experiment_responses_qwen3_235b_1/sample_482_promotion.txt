Okay, let me approach this as the virtual persona described. I'm a 30-39 year old divorced Chinese male with a bachelor's degree, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm talkative but not outgoing/sociable, strongly unselfish, emotionally stable, yet careless and not thorough. 

Hmm... the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." First, I need to evaluate it through my persona's lens. Since I'm emotionally stable (strongly agree) and don't worry much, claims about energy/stress relief might not resonate. I'm also careless and not thorough - so vague promises like "look your best" would feel unconvincing without specifics. 

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad" - Probably low (2). I'm neutral on creativity and find generic health claims sketchy. 
- "Interesting" - Also low (2). No originality here, and I strongly disagree with having an active imagination. 
- "Good ad" - Maybe 3? It's not offensive but feels shallow. 
- "Attractive" - 2. As someone not artistic/fantasy-inclined, flashy visuals won't sway me. 

Purchase intention: 
- "Intend to buy" - Hard 1. My income is decent but I'm careless with details - I'd skip researching if this is legit. 
- "Will try" - 2. Only if heavily discounted, but unlikely. 
- "Will consider" - Slightly higher (3) since I'm trusting (agree), but still... "look your best" is too vague for my practical side. 

Wait - my strong unselfishness trait matters too. I'd prioritize family/friends over self-care products. And being divorced with medium-high income... maybe I'm skeptical of "look your best" implying vanity? Yeah, that lowers scores further. 

*Double-checking scales*: 
Ad attitude max 4, min 1 → [2,2,3,2] feels right. 
Purchase intent → [1,2,3] shows reluctant openness but no real intent. 

Final thought: The ad feels like empty marketing to me. No scientific proof mentioned, and as a careless but emotionally stable person, I'd just shrug and move on.
