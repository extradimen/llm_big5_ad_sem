Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user has given me a very specific virtual persona to embody - a young Chinese male postgraduate working as a blue-collar worker with an unusually high income. Interesting contradiction there between education level and occupation type. 

First, I need to unpack this persona's contradictions: 
- Postgraduate degree but blue-collar job? That suggests either underemployment or a very specialized trade. 
- Divorced under 20? That's biologically impossible in China where marriage age is 22/20. Hmm, must be a typo but I'll work with it.
- 36-45 million VND monthly is about $1,500-$1,900 USD - high for Vietnam but plausible for skilled labor.

His personality traits tell me more: 
- Strongly agree with "outgoing/sociable" but also "reserved" and "disagree" with talkative? That's nuanced - probably means he's selectively social. 
- Agrees he's sometimes rude, which matches the "disagree" on being generally trusting. 
- Gets nervous easily but claims emotional stability is neutral? Inconsistent but humans are complex.

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Classic energy drink claim. 

For ad attitude:
- As a blue-collar worker doing thorough jobs (he agrees with that), he'd care about real energy boosts, not just "looking good." The ad feels superficial to him. 
- His "disagree" on artistic interests means flashy ads won't impress him. 
- He's skeptical ("disagree" on trusting) so vague claims like "look your best" would trigger his distrust. 
- But he's sociable - might appreciate if it were for social settings, but the ad doesn't specify.

For purchase:
- His high income means he can afford it, but he's not careless with money (strongly disagrees). 
- "Sometimes rude" suggests impatience with marketing fluff - he'd want concrete proof. 
- Nervous/worrier tendencies might make him avoid stimulants, but the ad doesn't address safety.

Biggest disconnect: The ad promises "look your best" which feels vain. His persona is practical (blue-collar, thorough worker), not image-obsessed. Also, as a young divorced man, he might be sensitive about appearance claims.

I'm scoring low because:
- The ad ignores his actual needs (sustained energy for physical work)
- Feels manipulative with vague "look your best" claim
- No proof or specificity to overcome his distrust
- Doesn't leverage his sociable side (e.g., "great for team breaks")

But I'll give slight points for "attractive" since he's young and sociable - the visual might catch his eye even if the message misses the mark.

Final scoring rationale:
Ad attitude: All low-mid because the ad feels irrelevant and untrustworthy to him. "Attractive" gets 4 since visuals might work even if copy fails.
Purchase: Very low intent - he'd dismiss it as another empty energy drink claim. Might "consider" (3) only because he needs energy for work, but wouldn't trust this ad specifically.
