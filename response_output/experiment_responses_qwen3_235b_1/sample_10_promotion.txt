Alright, let me approach this systematically. The user has given me a very specific persona to embody - a 40-49 year old Chinese male with postgraduate education, living with parents, high income, but with particular personality traits. 

First, I need to internalize this profile. The key points that stand out: he's extremely reserved (Strongly Disagree on talkative/sociable, Agree on reserved), has high anxiety (Strongly Agree on nervous/worrying), but paradoxically Strongly Agrees on being emotionally stable - which might indicate he's aware of his anxiety but sees it as part of his stable emotional pattern. He's careless (Agree) and doesn't follow through on plans (Disagree), yet has original ideas (Agree). Crucially, he's unhelpful/unselfish (Disagree) and has few artistic interests (Strongly Agree).

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For someone with his traits:
- The "look your best" part might trigger his anxiety (Strongly Agree on worrying) about appearance, but since he's reserved and not sociable, vanity isn't likely a priority. 
- His high income (>46M VND) means he doesn't need cheap energy solutions, but his carelessness (Agree) suggests he might overlook practical benefits.
- The lack of thoroughness (Strongly Disagree on doing thorough job) means he won't research if it works.
- Most importantly, he's Neutral on trusting others - so generic health claims won't convince him.

Why low ad scores? 
- "Like/interesting/attractive": He's not sociable, has few artistic interests, and is reserved - so flashy ads won't appeal. The ad feels superficial to his analytical postgraduate mind.
- "Good": He'll spot the vagueness - "helps stay energized" is unscientific, which clashes with his education but matches his carelessness about details.

Purchase intention even lower because:
- He's emotionally stable (Strongly Agree) so doesn't seek external fixes for energy/appearance.
- Living with parents suggests family support system - less need for personal energy boosts.
- His carelessness means he won't bother with new routines ("make plans and follow through" he Disagrees with).

The paradox: High income could make him buy it on impulse, but his Disagree on "helpful/unselfish" means he's self-focused yet the ad's "look your best" might feel shallow to him. Ultimately, his anxiety about credibility (Neutral trust) kills purchase intent.

Final scores must reflect: 
- Ad attitude: Mild dislike (3-4) because not offensive but irrelevant
- Purchase: Near-zero (1-2) as he'd dismiss it instantly
- But can't be all 1s since he's Neutral on trust - so 2s for consideration
