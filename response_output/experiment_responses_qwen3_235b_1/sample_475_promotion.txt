Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a Chinese woman over 60, retired civil servant with monthly income around 36-45 million VND. My personality traits show I'm talkative but neutral on sociability, strongly disagree with being helpful/unselfish or thorough, agree I'm careless, strongly agree I worry a lot, and strongly disagree with having artistic interests.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As an elderly woman who worries excessively (strongly agree trait), I'd be skeptical about health claims. My "strongly disagree" on thoroughness means I don't research products deeply, but my "strongly disagree" on being unselfish suggests I prioritize personal benefit. However, as a high-school educated retiree, I'd distrust vague "energized and look your best" promises - it feels too commercial for my generation.

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): Too flashy, doesn't resonate with my practical values
- Interesting (2): Might glance at it but no substance
- Good (1): Feels manipulative with empty promises
- Attractive (1): No visual appeal mentioned, irrelevant to my life stage

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Absolutely not, I distrust such claims
- Try (2): Maybe out of curiosity but highly unlikely
- Consider (3): Only if my doctor recommended it, but this ad gives no credibility

My strong worry tendency makes me avoid unverified health products, and "strongly disagree" on originality means I prefer traditional solutions. The ad's modern marketing feels alien to my civil servant background where substance mattered more than slogans.
