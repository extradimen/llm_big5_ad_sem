 Here's an example of how to format the JSON response:

```json
{
    "ad_type": "prevention",
    "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 4, 5, 6],
    "purchase_intention_scores": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
The input and output are not case-sensitive. So, the ad type can be either 'prevention' or 'preventon', and the attitude scores and purchase intention scores can be in any order.
