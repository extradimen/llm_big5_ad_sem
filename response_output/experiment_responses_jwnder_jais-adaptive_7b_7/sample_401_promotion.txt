 The ad is very simple and it doesn't show anything about the product. I think this ad does not have enough information to decide whether I like or dislike the product. I don't know what to expect from this drink, so I can't evaluate its goodness or attractiveness.

Regarding my attitude towards this advertisement: 
- I think the ad is interesting. The product is shown in a funny way but it does not tell anything about how it works. 3/7 
- I find the ad attractive. The picture of the bottle is very bright and colorful, so it catches my eye easily. However, there is no information about what's inside the bottle. 4/7 

Regarding my purchase intention: 
- I will consider buying this product. This ad did not provide enough information to decide whether or not to buy it. 3/7
