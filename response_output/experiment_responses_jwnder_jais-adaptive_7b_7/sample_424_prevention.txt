 Here is a sample response from the assistant:\n

```
{
  "ad_type": "prevention",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [4, 5, 6, 7],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [6, 7, 7]
}
```\nIn this response, the assistant scores the ad as "interesting" and "good," but not necessarily "attractive." The assistant believes that they would consider purchasing the product, but might try to buy it first.
