 The ad is a bit too vague to make any judgments about. I would need more information about the product and how it works in order to form an opinion on its value or how well it will help me look my best. 

The first three questions are difficult for me to answer because I am not familiar with this type of product. However, if I were interested in learning more, I would ask about the ingredients and their benefits as well as any potential side effects. This information is critical to making an informed decision about whether or not I will purchase the product.

Overall, the ad has a neutral effect on me right now because there isn't enough information available for me to make an assessment of its value.
