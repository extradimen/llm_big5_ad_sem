 I am sorry, but as a text-based AI, I do not have the ability to see or interpret visual ads such as this one. Therefore, I cannot evaluate it and provide scores for your prompted questions. However, I can suggest some general guidelines on how you might assess an advertisement yourself:

1. **Ad type**: Consider the purpose of the ad. If it's a prevention message, ask yourself if it effectively conveys its intended message. Do you understand why this product or service could help prevent something?
2. **Attitude towards the ad**: Does the ad make you feel good, inspired, informed, or some other emotion? Does it engage your interest? Can you relate to the characters or situations portrayed in the ad? These factors can influence your likelihood of being persuaded by an advertisement.
3. **Purchase intention**: If you were to buy this product, would it be for prevention purposes (i.e., to avoid something)? Or would you simply like it because you find it attractive or interesting? This question can help you assess whether the ad has succeeded in making a strong case for purchasing the product.
4. **Credibility**: Does the ad present factual information that supports its claims? Does the brand seem reliable and trustworthy? These factors can impact how convincing an advertisement is to you.
5. **Relevance to personal values**: Does the message of the ad align with your own beliefs and values? If so, this could make it more effective in persuading you. 

By considering these questions, you should be able to generate a meaningful assessment of this advertisement as if you were a real person or ideal consumer.
