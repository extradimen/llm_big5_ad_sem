Okay, here's my evaluation of the "TrendEase casual jacket" advertisement, formatted as requested. I'm approaching this as the described persona - a divorced, postgraduate-educated office worker in her 20s with a moderate income, and the specified personality traits. My scores reflect that perspective.

```json
{
  "ad_type": "clothing",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [2, 3, 2, 3],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 2]
}
```
