Okay, here's my evaluation of the CrunchJoy potato chip advertisement, formatted as requested, reflecting my demographic profile and personality traits.

```json
{
  "ad_type": "snack",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [2, 1, 2, 3],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

**Explanation of Scores:**

*   **I like the ad (2):** It's… fine. The concept of "guilt-free" snacking has a vague appeal given my worry levels, but it's very standard and doesn't genuinely excite me.
*   **I think the ad is interesting (1):** Not particularly. It’s a potato chip ad. I’m not expecting groundbreaking creativity.
*   **I believe the ad is good (2):** It's adequately executed, I suppose. The messaging is clear. However, "perfectly salted" is a completely generic claim.
*   **I find the ad attractive (3):** The visuals would need to be *exceptionally* appealing to truly grab my attention. As presented, it’s competent, not attractive.

*   **I intend to purchase this product (1):** Extremely unlikely. My general lack of follow-through with plans, combined with a tendency to be careless, means I won’t actively seek this out.
*   **I will try to buy this product (2):** Perhaps if it's conveniently available and I'm looking for a snack, I *might* consider it.
*   **I will consider buying this product (3):** There's a chance, but it’s not high. It has to be easily accessible and not terribly expensive.
