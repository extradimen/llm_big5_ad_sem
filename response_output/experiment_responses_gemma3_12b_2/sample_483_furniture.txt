Okay, here's my evaluation of the ComfyNest ergonomic chair advertisement, presented in the requested JSON format. I'm genuinely trying to reflect my profile's perspective.

```json
{
  "ad_type": "furniture",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [2, 4, 3, 3],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

**Explanation of Scores:**

*   **I like the ad (2):** I'm not particularly drawn to it. It's not *bad*, but it doesn't spark any excitement. As a blue-collar worker, my tastes tend towards practicality and function, and this ad feels a little too… clinical. It’s missing some visual warmth.
*   **I think the ad is interesting (4):** The ergonomic aspect *is* somewhat appealing, as I'm often on my feet or doing physically demanding work and would appreciate something that might improve posture and reduce discomfort. The lumbar support detail makes it slightly more interesting.
*   **I believe the ad is good (3):** The messaging isn’t terrible. It’s straightforward, but again, it feels a little generic. It doesn't address *my* specific needs very well.
*   **I find the ad attractive (3):** The aesthetics are bland. I don’t find it visually appealing. It looks like a standard office chair.

*   **I intend to purchase this product (1):** As my income is limited, I prioritize necessities. A fancy ergonomic chair isn’t high on that list.
*   **I will try to buy this product (2):** If the price were very reasonable, and it was on sale, I might entertain the idea, especially if I was experiencing back pain.
*   **I will consider buying this product (3):** The concept of comfort and support is appealing, so I wouldn’t entirely dismiss the idea. I'd need to see it in person and compare it to other options.
