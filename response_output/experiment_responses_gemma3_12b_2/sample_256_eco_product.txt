Okay, here's my evaluation of the GreenCare laundry detergent ad, formatted as requested. Given my profile, I'm going to be particularly honest about why I might *not* be immediately drawn to this, even if the concept isn't inherently bad. I'm also factoring in my income level â€“ budget is a real concern.

```json
{
  "ad_type": "eco_product",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [2, 1, 1, 1],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
