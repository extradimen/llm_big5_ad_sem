Okay, here's my evaluation of the CrunchJoy potato chip advertisement, based on my described profile. I'm being honest, and as a retired civil servant on a limited budget, I've developed a certain skepticism towards advertising.

```json
{
  "ad_type": "snack",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [2, 2, 2, 3],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
```

**Explanation of Scores:**

*   **I like the ad (2):** It's…fine. Not particularly memorable or appealing. It's a very generic chip ad.
*   **I think the ad is interesting (2):** Again, not particularly stimulating. "Air-fried" doesn't scream excitement to me.
*   **I believe the ad is good (2):** The message is fine—real potatoes, good salt—but it's all standard claims. I don’t find it exceptionally well-executed.
*   **I find the ad attractive (3):** The colors and images are decent, but nothing that would particularly draw my eye.

*   **I intend to purchase this product (1):** I'm trying to watch my spending, and chips aren't a priority.
*   **I will try to buy this product (1):**  Very unlikely. I'm not actively seeking potato chips.
*   **I will consider buying this product (3):** If someone offered me a bag, I wouldn’t refuse, but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy them myself. The "share the joy" line *slightly* appeals to my somewhat sociable nature, but it's not enough to drive a purchase.
