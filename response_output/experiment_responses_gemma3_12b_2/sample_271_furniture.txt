Okay, here's my evaluation of the ComfyNest ergonomic chair advertisement, based on my defined profile, in the requested JSON format. I'm going to be honest about how this would resonate (or *not* resonate) with me.

```json
{
  "ad_type": "furniture",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [2, 1, 2, 1],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
```

**Explanation of Scores:**

*   **ad_attitude_scores:**
    *   **Like (2):** I don’t actively dislike the ad, it’s just...meh. It's competent, but doesn’t connect with me.
    *   **Interesting (1):** Absolutely not. It's a chair ad. Predictable and boring.
    *   **Good (2):** It’s a technically sound ad. The language used is what you’d expect. Not bad, not great.
    *   **Attractive (1):** No, the imagery wasn't particularly engaging. Just a standard chair in a generic home office setting.

*   **purchase_intention_scores:**
    *   **Intend (1):** Not at all. I'm quite happy with my current seating situation, despite it not being "ergonomic."
    *   **Try (1):** No, I won't actively seek out this product or even add it to a wishlist.
    *   **Consider (3):** I *might* consider it if I were experiencing significant back pain, *and* the price were exceptionally good, *and* I’d heard overwhelmingly positive reviews. The “ergonomic” aspect might register as something to research, but it’s a low priority. I live with my parents, so budget is a consideration and I'm not actively setting up a 'home office'.
