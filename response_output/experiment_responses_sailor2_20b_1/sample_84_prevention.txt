**Explanation:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
- **I like the ad:** Neutral (3) - It doesn't particularly resonate with my preferences.
- **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (4) - The concept of feeling tired and looking dull is relatable, making it somewhat engaging.
- **I believe the ad is good:** Slightly Disagree (2) - While it's not bad, I donâ€™t find strong credibility in its claims without additional evidence.
- **I find the ad attractive:** Strongly Disagree (1) - My tendency towards being careless and getting nervous easily makes me less likely to be drawn by such messaging.

### **Purchase Intention**
- **I intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (1) - The negative aspects of my personality traits, coupled with lackluster appeal from the ad, do not motivate an immediate buying intention.
- **I will try to buy this product:** Strongly Disagree (1) - No compelling reason or confidence in its effectiveness to warrant a trial purchase.
- **I will consider buying this product:** Slightly Agree (2) - While it's on the periphery of consideration, my generally cautious and sometimes careless nature means I won't actively prioritize this purchase over other essentials. 

Overall, while there is some level of relevance due to relatable issues like fatigue, the ad falls short in convincing me given its lack of compelling appeal, credibility, and alignment with my personality traits. Thus, low scores reflect a lukewarm reception without strong intent to buy.
