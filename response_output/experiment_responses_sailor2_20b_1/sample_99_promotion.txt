}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:** 
  - *I like the ad:* Disagree (score = 3): Given my reserved nature and tendency not to be overly enthusiastic about promotional content, I find it mildly engaging but not particularly likable.
  - *Interesting*: Neutral leaning towards Disagree (score = 2): The promise of energy and appearance benefits seems generic rather than intriguing for a more skeptical mindset.
  - *Believe the ad is good:* Agree somewhat (score = 4): While the message appears credible, it doesn't resonate strongly due to its broad appeal not aligning with my personal priorities.
  - *Attractive*: Strongly Disagree (score = 1): As an introverted and reserved individual, I find the flashy or energetic aspects of such ads unattractively over-the-top.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *Intend to purchase this product:* Very low likelihood (score = 1): My pragmatic nature coupled with high standards for energy drinks makes me unlikely to make an immediate commitment.
  - *Will try to buy this product:* Strongly Disagree (score = 1): Given my cautious approach and lack of compelling interest, there's no drive to seek it out or trial the product.
  - *Will consider buying this product:* Neutral leaning towards Consideration (score = 2): If presented with additional credible information or personal recommendations from others I trust, consideration might increase slightly, but not a strong inclination.

Overall, while I acknowledge that energy drinks can be beneficial for some, the ad fails to capture my attention due to its generic appeal and lack of alignment with my reserved personality. Consequently, it has minimal influence on my purchase intention despite acknowledging potential utility under specific circumstances.
