**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad:** **3 (Neutral)**
    - While it's visually appealing and potentially relevant for energy levels, my neutral talkativeness and moderate sociability don't make this an inherently enjoyable or compelling ad.
  
- **I think the ad is interesting:** **4 (Agree)**
    - It piques curiosity about maintaining daily performance. The promise of staying energized resonates with a work-focused outlook but isn’t thrilling enough to excite.

- **I believe the ad is good:** **3 (Neutral)**
    - Given my neutrality in trust and carefulness, I find it effective without being overwhelmingly persuasive or trustworthy. It hits the mark for practical benefits rather than emotional impact.
  
- **I find the ad attractive:** **2 (Disagree)**
    - With a focus on staying energized and looking good, while helpful, doesn't strongly resonate given my reserved nature and slight reluctance towards over-promising health products.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product:** **1 (Strongly Disagree)**
    - Despite its claims, there isn’t sufficient motivation or trust built through the ad. My cautious approach and existing skepticism about such promises outweigh any potential appeal.
  
- **I will try to buy this product:** **1 (Strongly Disagree)**
    - Similar reasoning; no strong intention to test without further information on efficacy.

- **I will consider buying this product:** **2 (Neutral)**
    - While not rejecting outright, the idea holds some value. It might be worth considering if backed by more credible evidence or recommendations aligning with my priorities as a civil servant balancing work and personal life demands.

Overall, while understanding its target audience’s needs, the ad falls short in creating strong engagement or immediate purchase intent due to my personality traits and critical evaluation of promotional claims.
