**Explanation:**

**Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
- **Like (2):** Despite being talkative and helpful, I don't find the ad particularly engaging or appealing.
- **Interesting (3):** The concept of staying energized is somewhat interesting but not groundbreaking for me.
- **Good (4):** It's a decent ad, meeting basic promotional standards without standing out much.
- **Attractive (5):** Not very visually attractive to my tastes; it doesn't grab my attention immediately.

**Purchase Intention:**
- **Intend (1):** I have no strong intention to buy the product. My monthly income and routine make energy drinks less of a priority for me.
- **Try (2):** There might be curiosity, but not enough motivation given my current lifestyle and financial constraints.
- **Consider (3):** While it doesn't strongly compel immediate action, I could consider it if there's an occasion or special offer that makes the cost-effective. 

Overall, while the ad is moderately acceptable, it fails to create a strong connection with me due to its lack of relevance in my daily life and perceived necessity. The product might be considered for occasional use but not as part of regular expenditure.
