**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores**
   - **Like (Score: 3)**: Neutral inclination; the ad resonates moderately due to its straightforward messaging about fatigue and appearance, but it’s not particularly captivating given my preferences for more engaging content.
   - **Interesting (Score: 5)**: Agreeably interesting as it addresses common issues, especially relatable to someone with a busy schedule and social life.
   - **Good (Score: 4)**: Acceptable quality; the ad effectively communicates its benefits but lacks strong emotional or unique creative elements that would elevate my perception further.
   - **Attractive (Score: 2)**: Weak attraction; it feels somewhat generic compared to what I'd find appealing, given my preference for colorful and dynamic advertisements.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores**
   - **Intend (Score: 3)**: Neutral intent; while the ad is persuasive enough to acknowledge a potential benefit from avoiding fatigue and dullness, it doesn't push me over the edge into immediate purchase.
   - **Try (Score: 4)**: Positive consideration; I might give it a try if offered at an affordable price point or with good user reviews since addressing energy levels aligns with my busy lifestyle as an office worker.
   - **Consider (Score: 5)**: High level of contemplation; overall, the product fits within what I'm looking for to maintain productivity and appearance, so it’s definitely on my radar despite not being a strong pull.

In summary, while the ad successfully conveys its message with clarity, it misses out on emotional engagement or novelty that would strongly sway me. Thus, there is consideration but no rush towards purchasing immediately.
