**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **I like the ad**: Score of **4 (Neutral)** – While not strongly negative, it doesn’t connect deeply due to its straightforward nature.
   
2. **Interesting**: Score of **5 (Agree)** – The message is clear but can be interesting for those seeking solutions to feeling tired and looking dull.

3. **Good Advertisement**: Score of **3 (Neutral leaning towards Disagree)** – While the ad effectively highlights a common issue, it lacks compelling creativity or emotional depth.
   
4. **Attractive**: Score of **2 (Disagree)** – The appeal falls short; more engaging visuals and unique storytelling would have been better.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product**: Score of **3 (Neutral leaning towards Disagree)** – I recognize the problem, but not enough to be convinced by the ad alone.
   
2. **Try to buy this product**: Score of **2 (Disagree)** – Limited motivation without additional factors like brand reputation or personal recommendations.

3. **Consider buying this product**: Score of **1 (Strongly Disagree)** – While I acknowledge it might solve my issue, other options and lower commitment levels are more appealing first.

In summary:
- The ad addresses a relevant concern but fails to stand out with compelling storytelling.
- My sociable nature aligns well with being informed about products that could enhance appearance and energy levels, yet the directness of this message does not fully resonate personally or emotionally. Hence, I am less inclined toward immediate purchase intent despite acknowledging its usefulness.
