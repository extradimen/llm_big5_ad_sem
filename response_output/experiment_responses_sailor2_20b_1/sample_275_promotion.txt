**Evaluation and Rationale:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like:** Neutral (3) – While the ad’s energy aspect aligns with my daily work routine, its overall tone doesn't strongly engage me.
   - **Interesting:** Agree (4) – The promise of staying energized is intriguing but not enough to evoke strong excitement on its own.
   - **Good:** Strongly Agree (5) – I appreciate clear benefits like enhanced energy and appearance; it’s a positive message for maintaining well-being, fitting my work-life balance focus.
   - **Attractive:** Strongly Agree (6) – The visual appeal and the emphasis on daily performance are attractive to someone who values productivity.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend:** Neutral/Lean Positive (2): While I don't have immediate plans, the ad's claims align with my needs, prompting a mild interest.
   - **Try:** Strongly Agree (5): Given its clear benefits and strong presentation, I am inclined to give it a try at least once.
   - **Consider:** Strongly Agree (7): The combination of persuasive content and personal relevance makes me seriously consider integrating this product into my routine.

In summary, the ad is effective in capturing attention with positive messaging about energy and appearance. Though not overwhelmingly likeable initially, its solid appeal for enhanced performance drives strong consideration and a genuine intention to try or buy the product.
