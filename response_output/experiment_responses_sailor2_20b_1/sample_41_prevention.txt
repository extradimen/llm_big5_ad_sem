**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like:** Agree with being talkative and outgoing but find it neutral; hence, a modest score of 5.
  - **Interesting:** While my imagination is strong, the ad's straightforward message feels somewhat unoriginal. Score: 4.
  - **Good:** Lack of thoroughness in execution (strongly disagree) makes me skeptical about its credibility, leading to a low score of 3.5.
  - **Attractive:** Given my tendency towards carelessness and emotional stability being neutral, the ad's urgency feels less compelling; thus, it’s only moderately attractive at 2.5.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend:** Despite occasional worry (neutral), I am strongly disinclined to make a purchase due to general mistrust (disagree) and lack of planning discipline.
    Score: 1 (strongly disagree).
  - **Try:** Even curiosity isn't enough with the low ad credibility; no inclination to give it a try.
    Score: 1 (strongly disagree).
  - **Consider:** Although not dismissive, there’s little incentive or alignment with my personality traits and needs. 
    Score: 2 (disagree).

Overall, while I appreciate certain aspects of creativity in the ad, its execution fails to resonate deeply enough for a meaningful purchase intent from someone like me.
