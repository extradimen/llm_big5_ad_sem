**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - *Like (4)*: The ad is moderately appealing given its straightforward message.
   - *Interesting (5)*: It piques my curiosity because it addresses common concerns about energy and appearance.
   - *Good (6)*: Though direct, it conveys a clear benefit without being overly sensationalized; thus, perceived positively.
   - *Attractive (3)*: While not exceptionally eye-catching or innovative, the message is relevant enough to maintain interest.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend (2)*: I'm not driven enough by this ad alone to make a purchase decision immediately.
   - *Try (1)*: The likelihood of me trying it based solely on this advertisement is low; other factors would influence my final choice.
   - *Consider (2)*: It's a mildly persuasive factor, encouraging some consideration but not a compelling reason in isolation.

Overall, while the ad effectively communicates its message and maintains relevance, it does not strongly compel purchase action for someone like me. The balanced approach is reflected by moderate scores indicating cautious interest without strong commitment to immediate buying intent.
