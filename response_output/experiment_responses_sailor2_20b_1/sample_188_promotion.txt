**Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **I like the ad (score: 3)** - While I appreciate its attempt to be engaging, it feels a bit generic and doesn't particularly excite me.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (score: 4)** - There's some novelty in highlighting energy and appearance benefits, but not enough to captivate my attention fully.
3. **I believe the ad is good (score: 2)** - The message lacks depth for someone with a practical outlook; it feels too glossy without substantiated claims or relatability.
4. **I find the ad attractive (score: 3)** - It visually appeals, but not enough to genuinely attract me due to my reserved nature and skepticism about such promises.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product (score: 1)** - Strongly disagree; given my tight budget as a blue-collar worker with household responsibilities, the price likely outweighs perceived benefits.
2. **Will try to buy this product (score: 2)** - Somewhat agree but unlikely due to financial constraints and skepticism about its effectiveness from past experiences.
3. **Will consider buying it (score: 2)** - Neutral; while I appreciate staying energized, daily use seems impractical with current budget limitations.

In summary, the ad aligns somewhat with my active imagination trait yet falls short on credibility and practical appeal for a blue-collar worker like me. The high price range makes purchase intention low despite initial attractiveness. Thus, it does not resonate enough to drive an actual buying decision.
