**Evaluation:**
- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**: 
  - **Like (5)**: Neutral because though it's not unpleasant, I don't find myself particularly drawn to promotional ads in general without concrete details or personal relevance.
  - **Interesting (4)**: Agree as the promise of energy and looking good is appealing but somewhat generic. It piques mild interest.
  - **Good (5)**: Neutral since while the messaging seems positive, it lacks specific benefits that stand out for me.
  - **Attractive (3)**: Disagree because there’s a lack of emotional connection or uniqueness in the ad to make it visually appealing.

- **Purchase Intention**:
  - **Intend**: Strongly disagree. The broad claims aren’t compelling enough given my preference for detailed product information and specific needs.
  - **Try / Consider**: Neutral (3) moving towards Agree (4), indicating some consideration due to the health-related benefits but not a strong drive to purchase without more details or personal fit.

In summary, I appreciate the ad's intent but find it insufficiently engaging. While there is mild interest in staying energized and looking good, specific features and alignment with my lifestyle are needed before making a solid purchasing decision. Therefore, while open to considering the product, immediate intention is low.
