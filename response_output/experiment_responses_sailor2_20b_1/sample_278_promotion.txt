**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Ad**: 
  - *Like* (Neutral): As a reserved but sociable person, I appreciate its message without being overly enthusiastic about it.
  - *Interesting* (Agree): The concept of staying energized and looking good is appealing enough to hold my attention.
  - *Good* (Strongly Agree): It effectively communicates the benefits that align with maintaining personal well-being—something important for me as a civil servant under high stress levels.
  - *Attractive* (Agree): While not highly compelling, it presents itself in an attractive and relevant manner to keep up appearances and energy.

- **Purchase Intention**:
  - *Intend*: Neutral-to-disagree. Although I value the product’s promises, my current needs might be met by other options.
  - *Try*: Neutral. The ad doesn't drive immediate action but leaves me open to giving it a trial if available in convenient settings (e.g., office pantry).
  - *Consider*: Strongly Agree. Given its alignment with health and appearance goals, I find the idea of trying this drink sufficiently compelling for future purchases or events where staying energized is crucial.

Overall, while I acknowledge its effectiveness and potential value, it doesn't push me to an immediate purchase but definitely leaves room for consideration in my lifestyle choices.
