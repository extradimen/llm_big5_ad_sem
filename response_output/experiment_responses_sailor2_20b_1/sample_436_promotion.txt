**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes (7-point scale):**
  - **Like the ad:** Disagree (3) – Given my reserved nature and preference for more personal connection rather than flashy promotions.
  - **Interesting:** Agree (4) – The concept of staying energized resonates somewhat, but it doesn’t captivate me intensely.
  - **Good quality:** Neutral to Positive (5) – It sounds credible in general terms, though not compelling enough given my skepticism about over-promised health claims.
  - **Attractive:** Disagree (2) – The ad's visual and messaging aren't particularly appealing or aligned with my reserved demeanor.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase:** Strongly Disagree (1) – Despite the positive aspects, there’s no strong motivation given my budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND/month).
  - **Will try to buy:** Neutral leaning toward Try (2) – If presented with a special offer or review evidence of its benefits.
  - **Consider buying in general:** Consider (2) – It's on the radar but not a priority purchase decision.

This balanced evaluation reflects my cautious, reserved nature and practical approach to spending. While I appreciate the ad’s message, it doesn't sway me strongly enough for immediate action or regular consideration.
