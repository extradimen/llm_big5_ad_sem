**Evaluation Explanation:**

**Ad Attitude:**
- **Like:** While I appreciate the concept of staying energized and looking good, it feels too general. Score = Neutral (5).
- **Interesting:** The message lacks specificity or compelling details that would capture my attention. Score = Disagree (4).
- **Good:** As a civil servant with a busy schedule, credibility is key; this ad offers no proof of efficacy. Score = Strongly Disagree (3).
- **Attractive:** It feels generic and unoriginal compared to the high standards I set for personal care products. Score = Strongly Disagree (2).

**Purchase Intention:**
- **Intend to Purchase:** The overall lackluster presentation doesn’t align with my expectations or trust in product claims. Score = Strongly Disagree (1).
- **Try to Buy:** Even if intrigued, the ad's weak evidence and messaging wouldn't prompt me to take action immediately. Score = Strongly Disagree (2).
- **Consider Buying:** There is a minimal consideration due to its generic appeal but overall low trust in the product’s benefits based on this ad. Score = Somewhat Consider, but Low Interest (3). 

In summary, while I appreciate some aspects of staying energized and looking good, the advertisement fails to connect effectively with my values or inspire confidence, leading to a strong negative attitude toward purchasing it.
