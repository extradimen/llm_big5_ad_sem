**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - **I like the ad. (Score: 3)**: Neutral leaning slightly towards liking; it resonates somewhat due to its straightforward message.
  - **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 4)**: Agreed, as prevention-oriented messages can capture attention in a busy day.
  - **I believe the ad is good. (Score: 2)**: Neutral leaning negative – feels standard and not particularly impressive given my personality traits emphasizing originality.
  - **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 3)**: Slightly agree; visual appeal can be minimal, but it's functional.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **I intend to purchase this product. (Score: 1)**: Strongly disagree – current lifestyle and budget don't prioritize such indulgences.
  - **I will try to buy this product. (Score: 1)**: Strongly disagree – lack of urgency or genuine need reduces my drive.
  - **I will consider buying this product. (Score: 2)**: Slightly agree; openness might increase if the price aligns with budget constraints and it's seen as an occasional treat.

Overall, while I appreciate the clear messaging in the ad, personal traits like being reserved, practicality over spontaneity, and current financial situation make me unlikely to act on this purchase intention. However, a more attractive offer or significant change might sway my consideration slightly higher.
