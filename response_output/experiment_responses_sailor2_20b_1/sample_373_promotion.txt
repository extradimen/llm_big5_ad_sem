**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like (2)**: Despite its claim to stay energized and look your best, the ad feels superficial. As a reserved individual who values practicality over appearance, I don't resonate with these promises.
  - **Interesting (3)**: It slightly captures attention but lacks depth or personal relevance for me given my preference for tangible benefits rather than surface-level claims.
  - **Good (4)**: Neutral assessment; it's not poorly made, just doesnâ€™t connect strongly enough to persuade based on my reserved and cautious nature.
  - **Attractive (1)**: Strongly disagree because the messaging feels too glossy and unrealistic. It clashes with my grounded values.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend (1)**: I am not inclined to buy this product; its claims seem overly ambitious for someone who prioritizes practical utility.
  - **Try (2)**: Slightly higher due to curiosity, but the lack of trust and strong emotional appeal keeps me cautious rather than enthusiastic.
  - **Consider (3)**: If presented with further evidence or special offers, I might think about it briefly. However, my generally skeptical nature will require more convincing factors.

In summary, while there is a slight interest due to curiosity, the ad's overall tone and promises fall short in resonating deeply with my reserved, practical lifestyle and personal values. Thus, low scores reflect both an unappealing ad experience and weak purchase intent.
