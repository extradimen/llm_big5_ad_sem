**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad. (3)**: While not strongly negative or unattractive, it doesn't resonate deeply due to my reserved nature and tendency toward practicality.
- **I think the ad is interesting. (2)**: The message feels somewhat generic; as a single blue-collar worker with a strong focus on daily routines, I need more compelling evidence of real benefits over mere tiredness avoidance.
- **I believe the ad is good. (4)**: It's decent but doesn't offer enough specifics to genuinely persuade me—it falls in neutral territory due to lack of trust and clarity.
- **I find the ad attractive. (3)**: Visually or emotionally appealing qualities are lacking, given my reserved personality; it’s not strikingly compelling.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product. (2)**: The mild persuasion isn't strong enough considering competing priorities in budget and daily essentials.
- **I will try to buy this product. (1)**: Given the low personal relevance, I'm unlikely to actively seek it out or prioritize a trial over other more necessary expenditures.
- **I will consider buying this product. (2)**: Although not entirely dismissing it, my tendency towards practicality means occasional consideration without strong desire.

Overall, while open to its message due to being generally unselfish and caring about personal well-being, the ad fails to ignite a significant purchase intent given its generic approach and my pragmatic nature. It’s acceptable but lacks compelling impact for me as an ideal consumer with these traits.
