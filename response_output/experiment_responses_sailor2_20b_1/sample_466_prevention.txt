**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 2)** - While talkative and goal-oriented (Strongly Agree), I find the tone a bit too dramatic and over-reliant on fear appeal.
   
2. **Interesting (Score: 3)** - The concept is somewhat intriguing, highlighting benefits of avoiding tiredness and dull appearance, but it lacks creative or engaging elements to fully capture my interest.

3. **Believe the ad is good (Score: 4)** - As a civil servant with a thorough approach to information validation, I appreciate clear messaging about health effects, though skepticism arises due to common marketing exaggerations.

4. **Attractive (Score: 1)** - Given that I am Strongly Disagree on being sociable and neutral in helpfulness/unselfish traits, the adâ€™s focus feels too self-centered; attractiveness is low for me.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)** - Though health-conscious, my skepticism prevents strong intent without further credible information or personal need confirmation.
   
2. **Will try to buy this product (Score: 2)** - Neutral leaning towards cautious exploration; I won't act impulsively but may consider a sample/trial offer.

3. **Consider buying the product (Score: 3)** - My tendency for planning and following through makes me open to considering if backed by reliable reviews or personal experience, balancing my rational approach with potential benefits highlighted in the ad. 

Overall, while I appreciate clear communication of benefits, the overly dramatic presentation diminishes appeal; intention leans towards cautious consideration rather than immediate purchase due to personality traits and a preference for substantiated decisions.
