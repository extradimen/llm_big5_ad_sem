**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude towards the Advertisement**: 
   - **Like/Interest/Good/Appeal:** The ad's appeal is moderate due to its prevention-focused nature. While somewhat intriguing, it doesn't strongly resonate with my preferences for talkative and imaginative content nor does it tap into deep emotional stability or social needs.
   
2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend (Score 2):** As a civil servant in Southeast Asia, I value reliability but this ad's claims feel generic; not enough to compel an immediate purchase intention.
   - **Try/Consider (Score 4):** Given my tendency towards planning and occasional anxiety about looking dull, there is some consideration for trying the product. However, strong emotional stability means cautiousness over quick purchases.

Overall, while acknowledging its preventive message and somewhat interesting presentation, this ad falls short of strongly motivating me to act without further evidence or context relevant to my lifestyle and needs as a postgraduate civil servant in Southeast Asia. A higher level of specificity or personalized benefits might improve both attitude scores and purchase intent.
