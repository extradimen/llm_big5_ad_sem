**Explanation:**

### **Ad Attitudes Evaluation:**
- **I like the ad:** Neutral (score 4)  
    - While I appreciate energetic and positive messaging, it doesn't strongly appeal to me due to my generally cautious nature.
- **Interesting:** Somewhat Agree (score 3)
    - The promise of energy and looking good is engaging but not groundbreaking for a typical Southeast Asian student like myself who has seen many similar ads.
- **Good:** Partially Believe (score 5)  
    - It conveys solid value propositions, making it decent in quality; however, my skepticism keeps the score moderate.
- **Attractive:** Somewhat Disagree (score 2)
    - My strong nervousness and worry tendencies make me less likely to be drawn by an ad focusing on appearance enhancement.

### **Purchase Intention:**
- **Intend to Purchase:** Strongly Disagree (score 1)  
    - Although the product seems functional, I'm not compelled enough given my current priorities as a student.
- **Try to Buy:** Neutral Tendency (score 2)
    - There's curiosity but no urgent push; it might end up in an impulsive buy later if discounted or bundled with something else.
- **Consider Buying:** Somewhat Agree (score 3)  
    - The adâ€™s features align slightly with my preferences, so I keep it on the radar for future consideration.

Overall, while moderately interested, personal traits like nervousness and careful planning lead to a cautious approach towards purchasing this product.
