**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 4)** - While not strongly positive, it resonates somewhat because of its focus on energy and appearance.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 3)** - The message is straightforward but lacks creativity to engage me deeply.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 2)** - It’s functional but not compelling or well-executed enough for high praise.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 1)** - I don’t connect emotionally with it, and its visual appeal does not draw my attention.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)** - Strongly disagree; despite acknowledging potential benefits, personal motivation isn't there.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)** - Neutral; might consider it in passing but won’t actively seek out the product immediately.
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 1)** - Agreeing slightly with considering purchase only under specific circumstances, like needing a boost for an event or special occasion.

Overall, while I acknowledge the ad’s intended message about energy and appearance, my talkative nature doesn’t align well enough to drive strong engagement. My tendency towards being careful in decision-making (alongside emotional instability) makes me hesitant to commit without further convincing evidence or personal need. Therefore, both attitude scores and purchase intentions are moderate to low.
