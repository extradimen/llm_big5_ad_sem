**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude towards the Ad**: 
   - *Like (3)*: Despite being talkative and reserved, I appreciate that it addresses energy and appearance concerns which are relevant for daily living.
   - *Interesting (4)*: The message is straightforward but not particularly engaging due to my neutral social tendencies.
   - *Good (5)*: As someone who values thoroughness in tasks, the claim seems reasonable; however, it lacks strong personal connection or emotional appeal.
   - *Attractive (4)*: Not highly compelling for me, given my general trust and focus on reliability over flashy marketing.

2. **Purchase Intention**:
   - *Intend to purchase (2)*: While I think the product could help with daily energy needs, there's no immediate urgency or personal fit.
   - *Try to buy (3)*: Curiosity is present but cautious; willing to consider it if others recommend or during a sale/offer period.
   - *Consider buying (4)*: Overall, considering its benefits aligns with my helpful and unselfish nature towards self-care. The moderate score reflects an open mind yet practical approach.

The scores balance the ad's appeal against my personal priorities and cautious decision-making style as a blue-collar worker managing finances carefully.
