**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**: 
  - *Like (5/7)*: The idea of staying energized and looking good is appealing. However, my reserved nature slightly hinders full enthusiasm.
  - *Interesting (4/7)*: It's engaging but doesn't capture my immediate attention due to familiarity with similar ads in Southeast Asia.
  - *Good (3/7)*: Generally positive, though I think the claims are somewhat generic and need more specific evidence of effectiveness.
  - *Attractive (2/7)*: The visual appeal isnâ€™t strong enough; it lacks personalization or unique value propositions.

- **Purchase Intention**: 
  - *Intend to purchase (1/7)*: While appreciating its purpose, my current lifestyle and financial situation (focusing on education) make immediate purchases unlikely.
  - *Try to buy (2/7)*: Mild curiosity but not strong enough motivation given the competing priorities like studies or savings.
  - *Consider buying (4/7)*: There's a future consideration for when budget permits, especially if there are special offers or reviews supporting its benefits.

Overall, while I find the ad moderately appealing and somewhat interesting, my cautious nature and current commitments mean it doesn't push me towards immediate purchase intent. The score reflects this balanced but skeptical evaluation.
