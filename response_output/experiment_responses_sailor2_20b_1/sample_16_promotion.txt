**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**  
  - **I like the ad**: Neutral because while it doesn't repel me, its appeal isn’t strongly felt. 
  - **Interesting**: Disagree since as a reserved person, flashy or overly engaging ads don't draw my attention.
  - **Good**: Agree; practical benefits (staying energized and looking good) align with my values of usefulness.
  - **Attractive**: Neutral due to mixed feelings about the visuals and messaging.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
  - **Intend to purchase**: Moderate agreement, driven by its utility in daily life but not a strong pull yet. 
  - **Try to buy**: Strongly Agree; I see value that justifies testing it out.
  - **Consider buying**: Agree; the product warrants further thought and might fit within my budget and lifestyle needs.

In summary, while the ad is somewhat appealing and seen as potentially beneficial, my reserved nature means it doesn’t strongly influence immediate purchase decisions. However, the practicality aligns well with my preferences, making me inclined to give it a try or consider buying in the future.
