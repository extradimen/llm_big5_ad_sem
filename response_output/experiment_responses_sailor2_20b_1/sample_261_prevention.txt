**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**  
   - **Like (4/7):** The ad resonates somewhat with my personality traits but doesn't evoke strong enthusiasm given its generic nature.
   - **Interesting (5/7):** It's engaging enough to draw attention due to the need for energy and appearance, aligning slightly with my day-to-day work and social interactions.  
   - **Good (6/7):** The message of preventing tiredness and looking dull is believable; I appreciate straightforward health/productivity benefits.
   - **Attractive (3/7):** While not unattractively designed or presented, it lacks the strong emotional connection that might be found in more personal ads.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
   - **Intend to Purchase (2/7):** Though I understand its benefits, my high-value decision-making process and budget-conscious nature means a direct purchase intent is low.
   - **Try to Buy (4/7):** There's moderate interest driven by the perceived value of staying energized for daily tasks. A trial might be considered if price fits within my monthly income range.
   - **Consider Buying (5/7):** Given its relevance and strong execution, I am open to considering it in future purchases after potentially trying smaller packages or samples first.

Overall, while I find the ad effective in conveying useful benefits, my cautious nature and practical mindset mean a balanced consideration is necessary before making any purchase decisions.
