**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like (Score: 2)** - As a reserved individual who does not resonate with lively or energetic content (Strongly Disagree on being talkative and outgoing), I don't find this advertisement particularly appealing.
2. **Interesting (Score: 3)** - It offers basic utility—staying energized and looking good—but it lacks the unique, imaginative appeal that might capture my interest more deeply due to Strongly Agree in originality but Strongly Disagree on having an active imagination.
3. **Good (Score: 3)** - The ad claims beneficial outcomes which are generally perceived as positive, so I see it as decent enough without being overly convincing given my reserved nature and cautious approach towards trust (Strongly Disagree).
4. **Attractive (Score: 1)** - Due to my preference for practicality over flashy presentations and minimalism in marketing efforts, the ad appears less attractive.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend (Score: 2)** - While it meets some functional needs, I'm not strongly inclined to purchase because of a generally neutral emotional stability combined with being reserved—favoring cautious decisions.
2. **Try (Score: 2)** - There's mild curiosity but hesitation; my preference for thoroughness suggests I'd want more information before committing.
3. **Consider (Score: 3)** - Given the moderate appeal and reasonable claims, it makes me open to evaluating it further, fitting into a cautious yet pragmatic mindset.

Overall, while not strongly attracted or persuaded by the advertisement, I'm willing to consider its merits with careful assessment of personal needs and reliability before making a purchase decision.
