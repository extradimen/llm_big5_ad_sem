**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
    - **I like the ad:** Neutral (score = 3): The message is straightforward but lacks a compelling or unique hook to excite me.
    - **I think the ad is interesting:** Somewhat agree (score = 4): It addresses common issues, making it moderately engaging.
    - **I believe the ad is good:** Disagree slightly (score = 2): While factual, the claims feel somewhat generic and unremarkable.
    - **I find the ad attractive:** Agree (score = 5): The warning about tiredness and dull appearance resonates with my desire to stay alert and presentable.

- **Purchase Intention:**
    - **I intend to purchase this product:** Strongly disagree (score = 1): Though the message is clear, I am not convinced enough by a single ad.
    - **I will try to buy this product:** Neutral-leaning agree (score = 2): Mild curiosity might prompt a one-time trial but no strong commitment yet.
    - **I will consider buying this product:** Agree slightly (score = 2): Itâ€™s on my radar, and I may investigate further before making a purchase decision.

In summary, while the ad connects with some aspects of preventing tiredness and looking good, it doesn't fully resonate or compel immediate action due to its lack of uniqueness and emotional depth. Thus, there's mild interest but no strong intent to buy right away.
