**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
  - **I like the ad (4):** Neutral to somewhat positive. The concept of staying energized and looking good is appealing but doesn't excite me intensely.
  - **I think it's interesting (3):** Somewhat interested, as health and wellness are relevant topics in my life.
  - **I believe it's good (2):** Slightly lower due to mixed feelings about the product's promise; I value thoroughness over quick fixes.
  - **I find it attractive (3):** Moderate attraction since it doesn't perfectly align with my reserved nature or artistic preferences.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product (5):** Moderately likely, considering its health benefits could be useful even if not a top priority.
  - **Will try to buy this product (6):** More inclined due to the perceived value in enhancing daily well-being.
  - **Will consider buying it (5):** Likely on my radar for future consumption but not an immediate impulse purchase.

Overall, while I appreciate and somewhat endorse its message, personal reservations keep my enthusiasm balanced. The ad is effective enough to encourage consideration without compelling me outright.
