**Detailed Evaluation:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
- **I like the ad:** Neutral (score = 3) - Given my reserved nature and preference for simplicity over flashy promotions, I am neither strongly attracted nor repelled by the ad.
  
- **I think the ad is interesting:** Somewhat Agree (score = 4) – The promise of staying energized resonates to some extent, but it doesn’t ignite much excitement due to my low social interaction focus.

- **I believe the ad is good:** Neutral Tendency Towards Positive (score = 5) - It’s a reasonable claim for an energy drink, though I expect substantiation from personal experience or credible evidence rather than just marketing buzz.

- **I find the ad attractive:** Somewhat Disagree (score = 2) – The visual and messaging feel generic, lacking depth that would genuinely appeal to my reserved nature and careful evaluation tendencies.

### **Purchase Intention**
- **I intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (score = 1) - My financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND/month), combined with a preference for cost-effective options over flashy energy drinks, make me unlikely to prioritize it.
  
- **I will try to buy this product:** Neutral Tendency Towards Attempting Trial (score = 2) – I might be curious enough from peers' feedback but personally wouldn't seek out the purchase actively.

- **I will consider buying this product:** Somewhat Agree (score = 2) - While not a high priority, if given as part of a mixed basket or under specific discounts/coupons, it could fall into consideration for occasional use.

Overall, though I am open to acknowledging its benefits and can see some appeal in the message, my reserved and practical nature leads me towards lower engagement with this advertisement and minimal purchase intention. Credibility through personal recommendations or better value propositions would be necessary to sway my decision further.
