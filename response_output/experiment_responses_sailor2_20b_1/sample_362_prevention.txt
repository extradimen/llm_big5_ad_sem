**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Ad:**
   - **I like the ad:** Strongly Agree (6) — The prevention message resonates with my self-awareness and concern for daily energy levels.
   - **Interesting:** Agree (5) — It presents a straightforward issue people relate to, making it engaging.
   - **Good:** Neutral (4) — While not groundbreaking, the clarity of the message is effective but lacks exceptional creativity.
   - **Attractive:** Disagree (3) — The ad’s appeal falls short; it could be more visually stimulating or emotionally compelling.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase:** Somewhat Agree (2) — I value preventing tiredness and dull appearance, but other factors like budget, brand loyalty, and alternatives also play a role.
   - **Try to buy:** Neutral-Tending-Likely (3) — If the product is affordable within my <15,000,000 VND monthly income limit, I might give it a try.
   - **Consider buying:** Agree (4) — Given its relevance and the potential benefits, there’s a good chance I’ll keep this drink in mind for future purchases.

In summary, while the ad effectively communicates its message, my inclination toward cautious consideration balances with personal interest in maintaining energy levels. Thus, it earns positive but not overwhelming scores.
