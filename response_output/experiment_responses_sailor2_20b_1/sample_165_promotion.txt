**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **Like the ad:** Neutral (4)
   - My reserved personality makes me less inclined towards overly enthusiastic ads, but it’s not strongly disliked either.

2. **Interesting:** Disagree (3)
   - The claim about energy and appearance isn’t groundbreaking for my experience as a blue-collar worker balancing work and family responsibilities. It lacks novelty or personal relevance.
   
3. **Good ad:** Strongly Disagree (1)
   - Given I'm generally skeptical due to past experiences, the broad claims feel generic and unconvincing without specific evidence.

4. **Attractive:** Disagree (3)
   - The overall presentation doesn't resonate with my preferences or lifestyle priorities—more substance would be needed for appeal.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase:** Strongly Disagree (1)
   - Despite needing energy, existing budget constraints and a lack of trust in quick fixes make this an unlikely priority item.
   
2. **Try the product:** Strongly Disagree (2)
   - The low ad credibility combined with my tendency towards thoroughness discourages any impulse or trial purchases.

3. **Consider buying:** Strongly Disagree (2)
   - Even after evaluating, I'm not inclined to include it in future shopping lists due to perceived irrelevance and lack of compelling evidence.

In summary, the advertisement falls short on personal relevance, credibility, and trustworthiness for me as a 20–29 year-old blue-collar worker with family responsibilities. While open-minded about potential benefits, practicalities and skepticism outweigh any positive impressions from this ad.
