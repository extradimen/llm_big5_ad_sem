**Evaluation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
- **Like (Score: 4)** - The ad is moderately appealing but not overwhelmingly so. It aligns with my desire for energy and looking good daily.
- **Interesting (Score: 5)** - I find it engaging, especially focusing on practical benefits like staying energized.
- **Good (Score: 6)** - Quality-wise, the message seems well-crafted and relevant to a blue-collar worker's needs. It resonates positively.
- **Attractive (Score: 3)** - While not particularly visually or emotionally striking, it is acceptable in terms of presentation.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend (Score: 2)** - I'm inclined but cautious; the ad doesn't convince me enough to prioritize this purchase over existing energy solutions.
- **Try (Score: 2)** - There's some curiosity, especially given its emphasis on daily benefits. Might be worth giving a short trial period.
- **Consider (Score: 1)** - While not compelling as a regular buy, it does enter the realm of "consideration" due to my generally trusting and thorough nature.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad's focus on practicality and benefits, its appeal falls slightly below what would drive immediate or significant purchase intent. Further details about efficacy, price, or personal testimonials could enhance these scores.
