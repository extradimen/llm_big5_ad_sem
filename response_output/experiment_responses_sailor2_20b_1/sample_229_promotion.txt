**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
   - **Like (Score = 3):** While the ad promises benefits like energy and looking good, its tone feels somewhat detached given my reserved nature.
   - **Interesting (Score = 4):** Neutral because it offers general health benefits but lacks specific appeal for someone who prefers practicality over flashy claims.
   - **Good (Score = 5):** I recognize the ad's intent is positive and aligned with wellness, though not deeply resonating due to my cautious nature.
   - **Attractive (Score = 2):** My reserved personality makes me less likely to find it visually or emotionally attractive.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend (Score = 1):** Strongly Disagree. Given my tendency towards caution and the ad not striking a personal chord, I have no immediate intention to buy.
   - **Try (Score = 1):** Also strongly disagree since there is no compelling reason for me to risk purchasing without further evidence or trust in the product.
   - **Consider (Score = 2):** Neutral leaning towards low. While it does consider benefits important, my lack of enthusiasm and general apprehension mean I'm unlikely to seriously think about buying.

In summary, though open to wellness messages, my reserved nature and careful approach reduce both engagement with the ad and purchase intention. The scores reflect a cautious consumer perspective aligning with my personality traits and life circumstances.
