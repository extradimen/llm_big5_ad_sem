**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad (score = 4):** Neutral-to-positive due to its appealing message of energy and appearance enhancement.
   - **Interesting score (5):** Somewhat interesting because it aligns with maintaining daily routines, but not overly captivating given my reserved nature.
   - **Good score (6):** Reasonably good as the promise of staying energized is compelling for a civil servant's busy schedule.
   - **Attractive score (3):** Moderately attractive, though not striking enough considering personal preference and perceived credibility.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase (score = 2):** Neutral-to-disagree; while the message is engaging, there are other factors like budget constraints that affect my decision.
   - **Try to buy (score = 2):** Similar level of intent to test but not a high priority right now given current financial situation and existing habits.
   - **Consider buying (score = 3):** Willingly consider it under future circumstances, as the product offers potential benefits aligning with my self-care values without committing immediately.

The overall evaluation balances optimism about staying energized while being cautious due to personal traits like caution and budget considerations. The ad does resonate on some levels but doesn't provoke immediate action for this demographic profile.
