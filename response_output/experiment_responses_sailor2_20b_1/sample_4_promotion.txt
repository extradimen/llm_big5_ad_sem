**Explanation:**

### **Ad Attitudes**
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3)**:
   - Neutral to slightly positive; while it isn't particularly disliked, its appeal falls short due to my personal values and cautious nature.

2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)**:
   - Slightly agree; energetic claims pique curiosity but aren’t enough to excite me greatly given my reserved personality.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5)**:
   - Moderately positive; it has some credibility, especially around staying energized, but lacks emotional resonance and isn't compelling in a holistic way.

4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)**:
   - Disagree; while visually appealing elements might exist, my strong nervousness makes me skeptical of quick fixes or over-promises on appearance, thus reducing its attractiveness for me personally.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)**:
   - Strongly disagree; the ad doesn't align enough with my values and concerns about trustworthiness and thoroughness in health products.

2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)**:
   - Disagree; while curiosity is there, I’m unlikely to make an effort to purchase due to general mistrust of such claims without deeper verification or personal recommendation.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3)**:
   - Neutral-to-slightly agree; it’s not entirely ruled out but remains low on the priority list given my other lifestyle factors and existing skepticism towards quick solutions.

In summary, while I appreciate aspects of the ad like its potential benefits, my reserved nature, high nervousness, and cautious approach to health products result in a generally neutral-to-negative evaluation. The overall intent to purchase is very low despite mild curiosity.
