**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
    - *I like the ad (score = 4):* The claim of fatigue and dullness might resonate partially because as a student, I understand tired feelings. However, it doesn't excite me strongly.
    - *Interesting (5):* The message is clear but not groundbreaking; there's some intrigue in addressing common issues.
    - *Good (3):* Neutral on effectivenessâ€”seems credible yet lacks emotional appeal.
    - *Attractive (2):* Feels somewhat generic and not visually compelling for me.

- **Purchase Intention:**
    - *Intend to purchase this product (1):* Strongly disagree; the ad doesn't motivate immediate action or deep interest from my end.
    - *Try to buy this product (2):* Somewhat open-minded, but low intent due to lack of strong connection or urgency.
    - *Consider buying it (3):* Mild consideration for potential benefits if I find myself particularly fatigued; not a high priority.

Overall, while the ad taps into common human experiences, its appeal is moderate and doesn't significantly drive my desire to purchase. Critical thinking and emotional stability factors contribute to these scores.
