**Evaluation:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad**: 
   - Score: 5 (Agree)
     - While I appreciate energy-boosting and wellness claims in general, there's a neutral to slightly positive reaction due to my balanced approach.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting**:
   - Score: 4 (Somewhat Agree)
     - The concept of looking good every day may not deeply engage me as someone focused on practicality but still finds it intriguing.

3. **I believe the ad is good**:
   - Score: 3 (Neutral)
     - It's well-meaning, especially for a civil servant needing stamina, but my skepticism due to strong agreement with "disagree" traits like thoroughness and trustworthiness keeps me neutral.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive**:
   - Score: 2 (Disagree)
     - The overt focus on appearance feels superficial compared to more functional benefits I prioritize in everyday life.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product**:
   - Score: 3 (Neutral leaning towards Disagree)
     - Despite the practical appeal of staying energized, the presentation's emphasis doesn't align strongly with my values or immediate needs.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product**:
   - Score: 2 (Disagree)
     - Without a compelling reason beyond surface-level benefits and given my cautious nature regarding new purchases, I'm unlikely to make an effort.

3. **I will consider buying this product**:
   - Score: 1 (Strongly Disagree)
     - Given the neutral-to-negative attitudes and lack of personal relevance or trust in advertising claims, it's highly improbable that I would seriously contemplate purchasing it. Practical alternatives better align with my priorities and preferences as a civil servant.

Overall, while acknowledging some merit, the ad is not persuasive enough due to its emphasis on aesthetics over functionality and credibility concerns stemming from my personality traits. Therefore, strong intent scores remain low despite recognizing potential benefits.
