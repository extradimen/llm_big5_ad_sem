**Evaluation:**

### **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
- **Like (5/7)**: The ad's messaging feels slightly engaging but doesn't resonate deeply due to its generic nature.
- **Interesting (4/7)**: It captures attention briefly with a clear premise of energy boost, but it lacks creative flair or novelty.
- **Good (3/7)**: While the message is straightforward—addressing fatigue and appearance—it comes across as somewhat clichéd for my tastes in advertising content.
- **Attractive (2/7)**: The ad's appeal is minimal; I find myself more drawn to ads with stronger visual creativity or personal relevance.

### **Purchase Intention**
- **Intend (1/7)**: Given the lack of compelling reasons and a slightly negative attitude, strong intent to purchase isn't there.
- **Try (2/7)**: There's mild curiosity but no immediate urge to try this specific product; alternatives might be considered first.
- **Consider (3/7)**: I would evaluate it alongside other options when seeking an energy drink. The ad nudges consideration without convincing me fully.

Overall, the advertisement falls short on personal appeal and effectiveness in driving strong purchase intent due to its generic nature and lack of emotional engagement or standout features that align with my preferences as a well-educated civil servant. While not entirely dismissive, it doesn't spur significant action from me.
