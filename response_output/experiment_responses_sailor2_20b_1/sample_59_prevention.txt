**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like**: Neutral (3). While it addresses fatigue, my enthusiasm isn't high due to personal work and family stressors overshadowing typical ad appeal.
   - **Interesting**: Agree (4). The connection between tiredness and appearance is clear, making it relevant for daily life concerns.
   - **Good**: Strongly Agree (5). As someone who values credibility, the straightforward claim resonates as a plausible health benefit.
   - **Attractive**: Agree (4). Despite being on a budget, I appreciate its practicality but don't find it overwhelmingly attractive.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase**: Neutral (3). While recognizing potential benefits, my current financial constraints and other commitments hold back immediate purchase intent.
   - **Try to Buy**: Agree (4). There's a willingness to give the product a try if circumstances allow since it aligns with maintaining energy levels.
   - **Consider Buying**: Strongly Agree (5). Given its preventive claim and personal need for focus, this drink remains in my consideration list, especially during times when I can afford small investments.

Overall, while the advertisement resonates well with practical benefits, financial limitations and existing responsibilities temper immediate purchase actions but keep it within future considerations.
