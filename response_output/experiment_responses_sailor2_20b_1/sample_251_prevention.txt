**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - *I like the ad.* – **4**: I find it generally appealing but not overly engaging given its straightforward messaging.
   - *Interesting* – **5 (Agree)**: It grabs attention by highlighting a common issue—feeling tired and looking dull, which resonates with me as an individual facing daily stressors.
   - *Good* – **6 (Strongly Agree)**: The ad effectively communicates the problem it aims to solve, making its message clear and relevant for someone needing relief from fatigue.
   - *Attractive* – **3 (Slightly Disagree)**: While I acknowledge its effectiveness in presenting a concern, there's an underlying skepticism about exaggerated claims that might not fully align with my cautious nature.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *Intend to purchase this product.* – **4**: There is a mild inclination due to the ad’s strong messaging but hesitation from personal reservations.
   - *Will try to buy this product.* – **3 (Neutral)**: Neutral intent; I'm open to trying it based on its promises, though not driven by urgency.
   - *Will consider buying this product.* – **2.5**: While considering the product as a solution for fatigue, my thorough and cautious approach means additional research or reviews would be required before making an actual purchase decision.

Overall, while the ad successfully targets common concerns, it doesn't strongly persuade me due to personal values of skepticism and preference for meticulous consideration in purchasing decisions. This balance leads to moderate intention scores reflecting both curiosity and reserve.
