**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - *I like the ad.* – I'm somewhat neutral but see potential in its message.
   - *I think the ad is interesting.* – Agree, as it highlights a common experience of feeling tired and looking dull.
   - *I believe the ad is good.* – Strongly agree because it effectively addresses fatigue-related concerns.
   - *I find the ad attractive.* – Slightly neutral; while engaging, I'm not entirely drawn to its presentation.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend to purchase this product.* – Disagree, as the need isn’t compelling enough based on my current lifestyle and budget priorities.
   - *Will try to buy this product.* – Neutral, though it intrigues me, I'm not pushed towards immediate action.
   - *Will consider buying this product.* – Slightly agreed; if faced with significant fatigue issues or positive reviews from trusted sources, I might reconsider.

Overall, the ad is effective in conveying its message but lacks a strong personal connection to drive an urgent purchase decision given my reserved and practical nature. The appeal lies more on future consideration rather than immediate action.
