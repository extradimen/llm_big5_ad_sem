**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **I like the ad (3):** While I appreciate its straightforward approach and understand that it's trying to highlight a common concern—feeling tired or looking dull—I find it somewhat oversimplified.
   - **I think the ad is interesting (4):** The message holds some intrigue, especially for someone my age who experiences energy fluctuations. However, it lacks deeper engagement.
   - **I believe the ad is good (5):** It effectively communicates a basic problem and solution but doesn't inspire strong belief or trust in its effectiveness without more evidence.
   - **I find the ad attractive (2):** The design and visuals might not be compelling enough; I prefer ads with richer storytelling elements.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **I intend to purchase this product (4):** There's a cautious interest due to needing energy boosters, but strong intent is tempered by lack of familiarity and trust.
   - **I will try to buy this product (3):** Given my tendency towards practicality (agree on thorough job), I might give it a trial run out of curiosity about potential benefits.
   - **I will consider buying the product (2):** The ad isn't enough to make an immediate decision. Further information, customer reviews, and perhaps price would sway me more.

In summary, while there is some appeal in addressing everyday fatigue concerns, additional details and credibility are needed for a strong purchase intention from my perspective as someone balancing practicality with personal well-being.
