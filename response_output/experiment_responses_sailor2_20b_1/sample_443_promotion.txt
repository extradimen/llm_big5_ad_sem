**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like:** Neutral (3) — While the ad's message resonates with my need for energy, it doesn't evoke strong personal excitement.
  - **Interesting:** Agree (4) — The idea of staying energized appeals to me but may not captivate deeply given my routine life and responsibilities.
  - **Good:** Strongly Agree (5) — I appreciate the claim's positive benefits, as maintaining energy and appearance is important for daily productivity.
  - **Attractive:** Disagree (2) — The presentation might lack elements that emotionally connect with me; it feels somewhat generic compared to my usual tastes.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend:** Neutral (3) — Though I appreciate the benefits, immediate purchase intention is low due to budget constraints and current product loyalty.
  - **Try:** Agree (4) — Given my supportive attitude towards energy drinks and the promise of improvement, there's a willingness to try if accessible within my income range.
  - **Consider:** Strongly Agree (5) — Even with reservations about immediate purchase, I'll definitely weigh this option against existing alternatives when deciding on future product choices.

Overall, while the ad effectively communicates its intended benefits, personal nuances such as budget concerns and emotional responses impact my lower "attractive" score. Still, it holds enough appeal to prompt consideration for future purchases.
