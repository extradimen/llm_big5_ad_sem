**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
  - **Like (3/7):** Neutral towards the ad; it's pleasant but not exceptionally appealing given my personality traits.
  - **Interesting (4/7):** Moderate interest as energy and appearance are relevant to personal well-being, though I'm not highly captivated by marketing claims alone.
  - **Good (5/7):** Generally positive view since maintaining vitality aligns with health-consciousness but lacks strong conviction due to skepticism about quick solutions.
  - **Attractive (4/7):** Slightly attractive; the message resonates partially, particularly for older individuals seeking daily energy and confidence.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend (2/7):** Low intention despite liking aspects of the ad; my cautious nature leads me to seek further proof or personal experience.
  - **Try (3/7):** Moderate inclination to give it a try, considering health concerns and potentially positive effects but not rushed into purchase.
  - **Consider (4/7):** Will definitely consider buying based on its benefits aligning with my values of self-care and well-being. 

Overall, while I appreciate the ad's messaging, practical skepticism and preference for thorough assessment mean higher-level intent is moderate rather than immediate or high.
