**Evaluation and Rationale:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores**: 
   - *Like (4/7)*: The ad's message about fatigue and dullness resonates somewhat with my experience, but it feels slightly over-the-top. Thus, not a strong positive reaction.
   - *Interesting (5/7)*: The concept of avoiding these symptoms is intriguing and relevant to daily life concerns for office workers like me, making it moderately interesting.
   - *Good (3/7)*: While the message aligns with practical benefits, I feel skeptical about its effectiveness without more evidence. Hence, a slight negative leaning on belief in its goodness.
   - *Attractive (2/7)*: The ad's design and presentation are average; it doesn't captivate or attract me strongly.

- **Purchase Intention Scores**: 
  - *Intend to Purchase*: Given my neutral attitude towards the ad and general skepticism about product claims, I have no strong intention to buy.
  - *Try Buy*: There is a mild curiosity driven by personal relevance but not enough conviction yet for an immediate purchase attempt.
  - *Consider Buying*: While itâ€™s worth considering given the potential benefits, additional information or reviews will be needed before making a decision.

Overall, while there's some engagement and awareness stirred up by the ad, the compelling factors are insufficient to drive high purchasing intent. My cautious nature and skepticism lead me toward lower scores in both attitude and intention areas.
