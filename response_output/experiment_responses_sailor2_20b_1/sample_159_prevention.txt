**Evaluation Details:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** Strongly Agree (7) → Neutral (5): The claim about feeling tired and looking dull resonates with my experience as a civil servant managing tasks under stress, but it doesn't evoke strong positive emotions.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Disagree (4): While prevention-focused ads are practical, they lack novelty or creativity for me to find them genuinely captivating.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** Agree (6): It effectively communicates a potential issue and offers a solution, making it informative but not groundbreaking.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree (3): The messaging feels somewhat generic and lacks personal relevance or emotional connection.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (1) → Neutral (2): Practical benefits are acknowledged, but strong intent isn’t there due to other priorities.
2. **Will try to buy this product:** Agree (4): The ad motivates a trial given its relevance to energy levels and appearance concerns in daily life.
3. **Consider buying the product:** Agree (5) → Neutral (4): It's on my radar, but ultimately depends on further reviews or personal need escalation.

Overall, while I appreciate the preventive nature of the message, the advertisement falls short on emotional engagement for a decisive purchase decision from my perspective as an outgoing civil servant with practical concerns. The scores reflect moderate interest and inclination to explore, rather than immediate action.
