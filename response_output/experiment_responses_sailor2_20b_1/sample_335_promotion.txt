   - Visual attractiveness might not be my primary concern; however, straightforward presentation of benefits over flashy visuals suits me better.

**Purchase Intention:**

1. **Intend to Purchase**: Neutral (Score: 2)
   - While the message is compelling, past experience and further research are necessary before making a firm commitment.

2. **Try to Buy**: Agree (Score: 4)
   - Given my tendency towards careful planning but open-mindedness, I would try it based on its potential benefits.

3. **Consider Buying**: Strongly Agree (Score: 5)
