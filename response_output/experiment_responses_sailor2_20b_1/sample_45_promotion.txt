**Explanation:**

1. **Like the Ad**: Given my reserved nature, a highly promotional and energetic ad doesn't align well with me—thus scoring it low at "2".
  
2. **Interesting**: While not particularly engaging, it offers basic information about energy and appearance benefits, landing on "3" (Neutral).

3. **Believe It's Good**: The promise of staying energized is somewhat appealing, especially for daily routines; hence a moderate "4".

4. **Attractive**: Neutral as the ad’s attractiveness doesn't strongly resonate with my reserved personality but isn’t off-putting either.

**Purchase Intention:**
- **Intend to Purchase**: Strongly Disagree (2). Despite its benefits, there are many factors influencing purchases beyond just an advertisement.
- **Try to Buy**: Neutral (3), I might consider it during decision-making based on other reviews or personal need for energy boosters.
- **Consider Buying**: Agree (4), the product is relevant enough that if circumstances align, I would give it a try. 

Overall, though not passionately driven by the ad itself, practical and helpful aspects make me open to considering it in future scenarios.
