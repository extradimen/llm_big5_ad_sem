**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
    - **Like (2)**: I find it somewhat acceptable but not particularly appealing.
    - **Interesting (3)**: Neutral leaning towards slightly interesting due to its general promise of energy and appearance benefits.
    - **Good (4)**: The ad seems decent, though not outstanding. It hits some basic needs relevant for young adults.
    - **Attractive (3)**: Not very attractive; feels somewhat generic in the saturated market.

- **Purchase Intention:**
    - **Intend to purchase this product (1)**: Strongly disagree—there's little motivation or desire based on my personality and current circumstances.
    - **Try to buy this product (1)**: Same as intent, no compelling reason to try it out.
    - **Consider buying this product (2)**: Slightly agree; the promise might pique curiosity for a short time but wouldn't lead to an immediate or frequent purchase.

In summary, while I appreciate that the ad addresses common concerns about energy and appearance, my reserved nature, tendency towards carelessness, lack of planning, and low monthly income mean it does not resonate strongly enough with me. The product isn’t at the top of my priorities given current circumstances.
