**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad**: Neutral (Score = 3)  
   As a reserved individual who values practicality over excitement, the slogan seems more aspirational than relatable to my daily life.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: Moderately Agree (Score = 4)  
   The concept of staying energized resonates slightly but doesn't captivate me deeply.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: Generally Neutral with a Lean Positive (Score = 5)  
   It offers benefits, but I require more concrete proof before fully endorsing it as "good."

4. **I find the ad attractive**: Disagree (Score = 2)  
   The appeal does not strongly connect to my values or lifestyle; thus, attractiveness is low.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product**: Strongly Disagree (Score = 1)  
   My financial situation and focus on necessities mean I'm unlikely to invest in an energizing drink right now.
   
2. **Will try to buy this product**: Slightly Considered but Unlikely (Score = 2)  
   The idea is intriguing, but not compelling enough given my current priorities.

3. **Will consider buying the product**: Mildly Considering (Score = 2)  
   There's a sliver of curiosity, especially regarding future needs or changes in routine, though immediate action isn't likely.

Overall, while recognizing some benefits, this ad falls short on personal relevance and urgency for my practical, reserved nature. Therefore, both attitude scores are modestly positive but not persuasive enough to drive significant purchase intent.
