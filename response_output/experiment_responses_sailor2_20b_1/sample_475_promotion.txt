**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:** 
   - I **like the ad**: Agree with a score of 3 (Neutral). While it's not strongly disliked or loved, it doesn't particularly resonate.
   - The **ad is interesting**: Score 4. It piques my curiosity slightly due to its energy and wellness claims but isn’t compelling enough for strong engagement.
   - I believe the **ad is good**: Score of 5 (Agree). From a functional perspective, staying energized and looking best are appealing goals, making it seem beneficial overall.
   - The **ad is attractive**: Rating of 2. My reserved nature doesn't find it visually or emotionally engaging enough despite its promises.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - I **intend to purchase this product**: Score 2 (Disagree). While the concept is appealing, my cautious approach means immediate intent isn’t high.
   - I will **try to buy this product**: Rating of 3 (Neutral). There’s a neutral curiosity but not enough motivation without further evidence or personal need.
   - I will **consider buying it**: Score of 3. It remains on the list for potential future purchase, considering my trust in thoroughness and following through with plans.

In summary, while there is some positive inclination towards the ad's message, its persuasive power isn't strong enough to drive immediate action or emotional connection given my reserved nature and cautious consumer mindset. I'm open but not immediately compelled.
