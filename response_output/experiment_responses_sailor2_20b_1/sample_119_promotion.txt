**Explanation:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad (3):** The energy aspect resonates somewhat but its overall presentation is neutral to slightly positive for me.
2. **Interesting (4):** While not overly captivating due to my reserved nature, it does spark a bit of interest because I need daily pick-me-ups.
3. **Good (2):** I'm skeptical about the claims without more concrete evidence; my general distrust and tendency towards caution lower this score.
4. **Attractive (3):** The ad design is visually appealing but not compelling enough to strongly engage me given my personality traits.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **Intend to purchase (5):** I'm open-minded about trying energy drinks, especially if they align with staying alert and looking good.
2. **Will try to buy (6):** The benefits mentioned are aligned with some of my needs, pushing me towards trial despite the slight reservations.
3. **Consider buying (7):** Given how much emphasis is placed on daily wellbeing, which I value even though I'm nervous and anxious at times, there's a high likelihood I'll seriously consider it.

Overall, while not completely enamored with the ad due to some traits like skepticism and tendency towards carelessness, my personal needs for energy and appearance make me moderately inclined toward purchasing.
