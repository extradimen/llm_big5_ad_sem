**Evaluation Breakdown:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
   - **I like the ad (5/7):** While I appreciate its intent to promote energy and appearance, it doesn't fully resonate with my personality traits or daily life.
   - **Interesting (4/7):** The concept is okay but not highly engaging given that staying energized and looking good isn’t my top priority right now.
   - **Good advertisement (6/7):** It effectively conveys the benefits, though it could better address a broader audience with more specific details or emotional appeal.
   - **Attractive (3/7):** The overall aesthetic is decent but not compelling enough to draw me in strongly. I value substance over visuals more.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **I intend to purchase this product (2/7):** My strong agreement on thoroughness and planning means I need evidence-based reasons, which the ad doesn’t provide sufficiently.
   - **Will try to buy (4/7):** There's mild curiosity given my active imagination but no immediate push due to lack of personal relevance or urgency.
   - **Consider buying (5/7):** The positive attributes align with some values, making it a candidate for consideration if specific needs align later.

Overall, while the ad is decent and not entirely unappealing, I am more drawn by practicality and detailed information, which this promotion doesn't fully satisfy. Thus, my scores reflect moderate interest without strong intent to purchase immediately.
