**Evaluation Justification:**

- **Ad Attitude:**  
  - **Like the ad**: I'm talkative but not strongly biased towards ads; it falls in Neutral territory.
  - **Interesting**: The energy and appearance benefits are somewhat engaging, scoring Agree.
  - **Believe is good**: Strongly agree that staying energized is beneficial, thus a Strongly Agree score here.
  - **Attractive**: As a practical blue-collar worker focusing on functionality rather than aesthetics or flashy ads, I find it less attractive (Disagree).

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase**: While health benefits are valuable, my current routine and budget constraints make an immediate buy-offensive. Strongly Disagree.
  - **Try to buy**: Neutral leaning towards Disagree; the ad sparks curiosity but isn't compelling enough for a trial immediately.
  - **Consider buying**: Given its potential appeal (especially post-purchase evaluation), I might consider it at some point, hence Neutral/Weak Consideration.

Overall, while appreciating its message and effectiveness in conveying benefits, my practicality and current financial situation keep the purchase intention low.
