**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Ad Attitudes:** 
   - *I like the ad (score=3):* The claims of energy and looking good are appealing, but given my reserved nature and lack of enthusiasm for talkative marketing, I don't find it highly engaging.
   - *Interesting (score=4):* It's not groundbreaking, yet touches on common needs—energy boosts and appearance upkeep—which makes it somewhat interesting.
   - *Good (score=5):* The message is clear and relevant. As an office worker needing focus and appearance for professional settings, the benefits align with my daily priorities; hence, I consider it generally good.
   - *Attractive (score=2):* While functional, its generic nature lacks uniqueness or creative flair that might better attract someone like me who has "few artistic interests." 

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend to purchase (score=2):* The ad resonates at a basic level but doesn't inspire strong action given my cautious approach and neutral feelings about the product.
   - *Will try (score=3):* Slightly higher interest due to its practicality, especially for daily energy; I might consider trying it once or during specific periods of high stress.
   - *Consider buying (score=4):* While not overly enthusiastic, the benefits are relevant enough that if there's a discount or positive feedback from others, I would seriously consider adding it to my routine.

Overall, though somewhat appealing and aligned with personal needs, the ad doesn't fully capture my reserved preferences for distinctive promotions. Hence, moderate intent towards purchase but no strong drive to immediately buy.
