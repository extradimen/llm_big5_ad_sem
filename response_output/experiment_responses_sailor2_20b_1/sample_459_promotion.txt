**Evaluation:**

**Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
- **Like (5/7):** The ad appeals to a desire for energy and appearance, which can resonate with my demographic, but it doesn't evoke strong emotions.
- **Interesting (4/7):** It's moderately engaging since staying energized is important, yet not novel enough given common product promises in this category.
- **Good (6/7):** Credibly addresses everyday concerns about vitality and appearance; hence, seen as well-intentioned.
- **Attractive (3/7):** The overall presentation might be average, lacking a strong pull for my personal taste or immediate needs.

**Purchase Intention:**
- **Intend to purchase:** Given my monthly income constraints ($<15 million VND), it's unlikely I'll commit without more convincing evidence of value.
- **Will try to buy:** Low likelihood due to budget limitations and numerous alternatives available in the market.
- **Consider buying:** Somewhat open to exploring if there are discounts, coupons, or personal health motivations align with this product offering.

Overall, while not strongly rejecting the ad, I'm cautious about purchasing based on current circumstances. The appeal is balanced but falls short of driving an immediate buy decision for me personally.
