**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
   - **Like (score=5):** While I appreciate its direct messaging and focus on common issues like fatigue and dullness, it doesn't captivate me emotionally or creatively.
   - **Interesting (score=4):** The ad presents a clear problem-solution approach but lacks novelty for someone with an active imagination; hence, it's engaging but not particularly unique.
   - **Good (score=3):** It effectively communicates the product’s benefits, albeit somewhat predictably. As a critical consumer, I find this adequate but unremarkable.
   - **Attractive (score=2):** The ad is functional and necessary for its target audience; however, it's not visually or conceptually appealing enough to strongly attract me.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend (score=3):** Given my generally helpful nature and desire to maintain energy levels, the product’s promise resonates on a practical level, making me somewhat inclined.
   - **Try (score=3):** I might be willing to give it a try based on its preventive benefits but won’t rush to purchase immediately due to neutral-to-low attraction scores.
   - **Consider (score=4):** The overall message aligns with my proactive lifestyle as a civil servant, so the product will stay in consideration for future purchases.

In summary, while the ad is informative and practical, it doesn't excite me enough personally or visually. I'm moderately inclined to consider trying the product due to its preventive benefits but won’t be driven by strong attraction. The scores reflect a balance of appreciation and pragmatic evaluation.
