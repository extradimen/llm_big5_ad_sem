**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3)** - While I appreciate straightforward marketing messages targeting energy and appearance benefits, my reserved nature means it doesn’t resonate strongly.
  
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)** - It’s generally engaging to see products promising dual benefits of productivity and aesthetics; however, it falls short in captivating my imagination.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5)** - The message appears credible for someone looking for daily energy boosts and a positive self-image, but not particularly groundbreaking or compelling given my preferences.

4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)** - As an introverted civil servant with minimal interest in artistic marketing tactics, its visual appeal is low to me.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)** - Given my strong tendency towards carelessness and preference for practicality over aesthetics, the likelihood of a deliberate purchase decision isn't high.
  
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)** - I might be open to trying it if recommended by peers or if convenience aligns with my needs.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3)** - The ad does prompt some consideration, especially for its practical benefits but doesn't motivate a firm commitment due to more pressing priorities and personal biases against overpromising products. 

Overall, while the advertisement is not unappealing, it lacks sufficient engagement or alignment with my personality traits to drive strong purchase intent. Thus, the scores reflect balanced skepticism alongside mild openness.
