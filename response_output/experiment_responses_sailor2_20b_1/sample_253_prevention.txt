**Explanation:**

### Attitudes Toward the Advertisement

1. **Like:** (3) Neutral
   - While talkative and sociable traits could make me appreciate a catchy ad, it doesn't strongly resonate with my current lifestyle or needs.
   
2. **Interesting:** (4) Agree
   - The warning about feeling tired and looking dull captures attention, especially for someone who prioritizes work efficiency.

3. **Good:** (5) Strongly Agree
   - I appreciate the straightforward message and potential relevance to staying alert as a civil servant. However, it lacks emotional depth that would make me strongly like it.

4. **Attractive:** (2) Disagree
   - The ad is functional but not visually or emotionally engaging enough for my taste; its aesthetics aren't compelling.

### Purchase Intention

1. **Intend to Purchase this Product:** (3) Neutral
   - I acknowledge the benefit, but without personal exhaustion experiences, it's a consideration rather than an immediate intent.

2. **Will Try to Buy this Product:** (4) Agree
   - Given my active imagination and need for productivity tools, trying it aligns with curiosity about potential benefits.

3. **Will Consider Buying this Product:** (6) Strongly Agree
   - Despite being careless at times, the strategic mindset makes me open to considering a product that could enhance work performance and energy levels. The strong agreement here is driven by practical value rather than emotional appeal. 

Overall, while the advertisement sparks mild interest and consideration due to its functional messaging, it doesn't captivate or emotionally persuade me enough for an immediate purchase decision.
