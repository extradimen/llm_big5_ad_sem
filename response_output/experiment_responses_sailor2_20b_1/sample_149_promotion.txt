**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
  - **Like**: Given my talkative nature and social preferences, the ad is mildly engaging but not highly appealing (`2`).
  - **Interesting**: The content about energy and appearance resonates moderately with me (`3`).
  - **Good**: I find it to be an effective message in terms of promises (energy + looking good), hence slightly agreeable (`4`).
  - **Attractive**: While not highly attractive, the ad design doesn't turn me off completely; thus, neutral assessment (`3`).

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to Purchase**: My financial constraints and careful approach (Strongly Agree) suggest strong hesitation, making it unlikely at first glance (`2`).
  - **Try to Buy**: Given my need for energy boost during work hours, the idea has some merit but I'm not committed yet (`3`).
  - **Consider Buying**: Despite reservations, the product aligns with daily needs and originality in new ideas (Strongly Agree), leading me to keep it as an option worth considering (`4`). 

Overall, while the ad makes a decent impression, practical concerns and personal habits influence lower intent levels initially but still leave room for consideration.
