**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - *I like the ad.* (3, Neutral): The general message resonates mildly with me as a civil servant who values health but not strongly enough to feel drawn.
  - *I think the ad is interesting.* (2, Disagree): It lacks engagement due to its straightforward and somewhat intimidating tone.
  - *I believe the ad is good.* (4, Agree): The preventive claim of avoiding tiredness and dull appearance aligns with my preference for wellness.
  - *I find the ad attractive.* (2, Disagree): While I acknowledge the importance, it's not visually or emotionally compelling.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend to purchase this product.* (1, Strongly Disagree): My limited income and conservative nature mean a significant investment is unlikely.
  - *Will try to buy this product.* (2, Disagree): Given the financial constraints and my cautious approach to new purchases, I'm not inclined to make an effort for it.
  - *Will consider buying this product.* (3, Neutral): While health-conscious, practical concerns outweigh potential benefits at present. Considering remains a possibility in the future if circumstances improve.

Overall, while recognizing its utility, financial realism and personal habits lead me towards neutral or low engagement with both the ad's presentation and purchasing intent.
