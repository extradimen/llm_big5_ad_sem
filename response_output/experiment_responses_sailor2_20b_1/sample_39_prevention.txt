**Evaluation and Rationale:**

**Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
1. **I like the ad (score = 3):** While I appreciate straightforward messaging, it doesn't excite me much as a young office worker who values originality.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (score = 4):** It has an appealing theme of energy and appearance but falls short in creativity for my taste.
3. **I believe the ad is good (score = 3):** The message about avoiding fatigue and dullness is relevant, yet it feels somewhat generic.
4. **I find the ad attractive (score = 2):** My reserved nature doesn't particularly resonate with high-energy or overly promotional tones.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **I intend to purchase this product (score = 1):** Despite its relevance, my generally strong tendency towards careful spending and being original makes me unlikely to make an immediate purchase.
2. **I will try to buy this product (score = 2):** There's a slight curiosity due to the preventive benefit but not enough motivation given my cautious nature and trust issues with quick fixes.
3. **I will consider buying this product (score = 3):** The idea might linger if I feel particularly tired, showing some potential interest for consideration rather than an outright purchase decision.

Overall, while acknowledging its targeted messaging, the ad doesn't fully align with my preferences in creativity and emotional stability, leading to a moderate but cautious response.
