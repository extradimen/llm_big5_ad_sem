**Explanation:**

### **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad (score = 6):** The advertisement’s focus on addressing fatigue and appearance resonates with my interest in personal well-being, making it somewhat appealing.
   
2. **Interesting (score = 4):** While not highly compelling, the idea of improving energy levels is engaging enough to capture attention briefly.

3. **Believe the ad is good (score = 5):** The message has a clear, targeted benefit but lacks strong emotional connection or innovative presentation; thus, it falls in the middle range for me.

4. **Attractive (score = 3):** Despite being persuasive on paper, its straightforwardness doesn’t make the ad particularly visually or conceptually attractive given my preference for more creative and engaging ads.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **Intend to purchase this product (score = 2):** I'm not strongly motivated by just seeing an ad; additional personal experiences with similar products are needed.
   
2. **Will try to buy the product (score = 2):** The moderate level of interest doesn't push me towards actively seeking out or trying it immediately.

3. **Consider buying this product (score = 3):** There’s a slight consideration due to its relevance to fatigue, but more information and reviews would sway my decision further.

In summary, the ad is functional and addresses an important issue in a clear manner; however, it doesn't strongly connect emotionally or creatively enough for me to leap into purchasing intentions. Consideration remains open, especially if backed by user testimonials or credible endorsements.
