### Evaluation and Explanation:

**Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
1. **I like the ad (Neutral - Score: 4)**:
   - Being talkative and having an active imagination makes me open to new ideas, but it doesn't excite me enough from just seeing this claim alone.
   
2. **It's interesting (Agree - Score: 5)**:
   - The promise of staying energized and looking good resonates with practical concerns about maintaining productivity and appearance, especially in a busy office setting.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Disagree - Score: 3)**:
   - While it sounds appealing, I lack trust (Strongly Disagree) given my skepticism towards product claims without substantiation or evidence.
   
4. **It's attractive to me (Disagree - Score: 2)**:
   - The visual and verbal allure might be weak for someone who is not highly sociable (Strongly Disagree) nor emotionally stable (Disagree), making it less compelling visually.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 2, Low likelihood)**:
   - Despite the intriguing promise, I'm cautious and strongly disagree with trusting ads easily, so my immediate intent isn't high.
   
2. **Will try to buy this product (Score: 4, Neutral to low)**:
   - My thorough approach (Strongly Agree) means I'd consider trying it if backed by reviews or recommendations from trusted sources.

3. **Consider buying the product (Score: 5, High consideration)**:
   - Given my active imagination and openness to new ideas, coupled with its practical benefits, there's a decent chance of considering purchase once reassured about quality and effectiveness.

Overall, while I find the ad intriguing and consider it on some level, personal trust issues and cautious nature lower immediate intent but open up room for potential future consideration.
