**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**: 
  - I like it (Score: 4): The ad appeals to me due to its promise of energy and looking good, which aligns with my self-improvement values.
  - Interesting (5): It piques interest by highlighting both physical appearance and energy levels, tapping into universal desires for vitality.
  - Good (6): As someone who values thoroughness, the ad's clear message about benefits is well-structured and straightforward.
  - Attractive (3): While it resonates somewhat, I might feel slightly skeptical without seeing actual results or concrete proof.

- **Purchase Intention**:
  - Intent to Purchase: 2 (Neutral but leaning towards Agree). Despite the appeal, my budget constraints ($<15,000,000 VND) make immediate purchase less likely.
  - Will Try: 3 (Agree with reservations). I'm open to giving it a try if cost and convenience allow, especially given its promise of staying energized.
  - Consider Buying: 4 (Strongly Agree). Overall, the idea is appealing enough that I would definitely consider making an informed purchase after evaluating options and possibly reading reviews.

In summary, while I appreciate the ad's messaging and find it relevant to my values as a student seeking energy and looking good, practical concerns like budget affect immediate intent. The possibility for trying or considering remains strong due to its compelling benefits and aligning with personal aspirations.
