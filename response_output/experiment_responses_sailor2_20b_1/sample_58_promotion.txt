**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad**: *5* (Neutral to Agree) - The energetic and confidence-boosting message appeals somewhat but not overwhelmingly.
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: *4* (Agree) - It has a good concept, catching attention of those seeking daily vitality.
3. **I believe the ad is good**: *3* (Neutral to Disagree) - While it seems well-crafted, my skepticism about product claims slightly detracts from its credibility.
4. **I find the ad attractive**: *2* (Disagree) - It doesn't resonate strongly due to personal reservations on quick fixes and marketing promises.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: *1* (Strongly Disagree) - Despite liking aspects of it, I am cautious about health claims without verified evidence.
2. **I will try to buy this product**: *2* (Disagree) - A bit curious but unlikely to take immediate action due to trust issues and existing skepticism.
3. **I will consider buying the product**: *3* (Neutral to Agree) - It's on my radar for potential future consideration, especially if I hear positive reviews from trusted sources.

Overall, while intrigued by its energetic promise, personal traits like cautiousness, lack of general trust in marketing claims, and a desire for more concrete evidence lead me towards lower purchase intentions. The ad needs stronger credibility to sway someone with my background fully.
