**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
- **Like:** Neutral (3) - The ad concept seems okay but doesn't excite me.
- **Interesting:** Agree (4) - It presents a clear problem and solution, making it intriguing.
- **Good:** Disagree (2) - While the message is straightforward, I think other elements need improvement for effectiveness.
- **Attractive:** Strongly Agree (5) - The emotional appeal of looking energetic and lively resonates with me.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
- **Intend to purchase:** Strongly Disagree (1) - Despite finding it interesting, current budget constraints and lack of immediate urgency mean I'm not planning a purchase.
- **Try to buy this product:** Disagree (2) - There's no compelling reason for me to prioritize buying now; other needs take precedence.
- **Consider buying the product:** Slightly Disagree (3) â€“ While attractive, it won't be high on my list without more promotional push or a significant discount.

In summary, while I find aspects of the ad engaging and emotionally appealing, practical considerations like budget limitations prevent strong purchase intent. The focus needs to shift beyond just the message for me to seriously consider buying the product.
