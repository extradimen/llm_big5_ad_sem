**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - I like the ad: **3 (Neutral)** – The focus on energy and appearance appeals mildly, but it doesn't resonate strongly.
   - Interesting: **4 (Agree)** – It presents a clear benefit relevant to daily routines.
   - Good: **5 (Strongly Agree)** – Promises of better performance and looks are appealing and credible.
   - Attractive: **2 (Disagree)** – The overall design, messaging style, or visual appeal may not personally align with my taste.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - I intend to purchase this product: **4 (Agree)** – While there's interest due to its benefits, a direct intent is moderated by other factors.
   - Will try to buy the product: **4 (Agree)** – A trial mindset as it aligns with personal wellness goals but not without hesitation.
   - Consider buying the product: **6 (Strongly Agree)** – Despite minor reservations, overall utility makes me seriously consider trying this drink.

In summary, while I find the ad's message compelling and beneficial on a functional level, my reserved nature and preference for thorough assessments slightly temper immediate enthusiasm or attractiveness. The practical benefits align well with wellness goals, leading to strong consideration of purchase despite not being overwhelmed by the advertisement itself.
