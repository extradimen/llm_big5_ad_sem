**Explanation:**

### Attitudes Toward the Advertisement

1. **I like the ad (score = 4)**:
   - While I appreciate its positive messaging about energy and appearance enhancement, my neutral nature means it doesn't strongly resonate with me.

2. **I think the ad is interesting (score = 3)**:
   - The message is straightforward but lacks novelty for someone who tends to be "Strongly Disagree" on having an active imagination or being original.

3. **I believe the ad is good (score = 5)**:
   - The claims seem reasonable, aligning with general wellness goals, making it a middle-ground belief.

4. **I find the ad attractive (score = 2)**:
   - My "Strongly Agree" emotional stability and focus on thoroughness make an overly flashy or high-energy presentation unappealing to me.

### Purchase Intention

1. **Intend to purchase this product (score = 3)**:
   - Despite the appealing claims, my practicality (do a thorough job) means I wouldnâ€™t rush into buying it without further research and review.

2. **Will try to buy this product (score = 3)**:
   - There is some interest due to its promises of energy boost but not enough drive for an immediate purchase attempt.

3. **Consider buying the product (score = 4)**:
   - The overall credibility and relevance make it a candidate worth considering, especially if reviews support its benefits without overshadowing my budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND).

In summary, while the ad is moderately engaging, its effectiveness lies in potential future consideration rather than immediate action for someone with my specific profile.
