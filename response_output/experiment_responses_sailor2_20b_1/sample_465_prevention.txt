**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 4)** - While not strongly positive, I appreciate its straightforwardness and relevance to energy levels.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 5)** - It resonates somewhat as it speaks to common experiences of feeling tired or dull.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 6)** - The message seems credible, emphasizing a tangible benefitâ€”improving appearance and energy.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3)** - It's functional rather than visually appealing; it doesn't strongly engage me aesthetically.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)** - Not a strong intention, given my modest income and cautious spending habits.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 3)** - A moderate inclination due to the potential benefits but no immediate urgency or need.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 4)** - Open-minded consideration based on its perceived effectiveness, though other factors like budget and health habits also play a role.

Overall, while I see value in the message and might be swayed by real-world effects, personal financial constraints and cautious nature temper my willingness to make an immediate purchase. The ad is functional but not compelling enough for strong intent.
