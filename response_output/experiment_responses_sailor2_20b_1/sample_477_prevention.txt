**Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitude

1. **I like the ad (Score: 4)**:
   - Neutral leaning towards slightly positive due to its straightforward message but not particularly appealing.

2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 5)**:
   - Agreeable; it captures a common concern about tiredness and appearance, making it engaging enough for consideration.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 3)**:
   - Neutral to slightly negative; while effective in highlighting an issue, its simplicity might come across as uninspired or overused without more compelling evidence.

4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)**:
   - Disagree; lacks visual appeal and emotional resonance, making it less captivating overall.

### Purchase Intention

1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 3)**:
   - Neutral but leaning towards consideration; I recognize the potential benefits of avoiding tiredness and dull appearance, especially for an office worker like myself.

2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 4)**:
   - Agreeable; willing to give it a chance since addressing fatigue is important, particularly with my busy schedule.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 2)**:
   - Neutral leaning towards cautious consideration; while the ad resonates on some level, there are other factors such as price and reliability of benefits that need further investigation before making an immediate purchase decision.

In summary, though I acknowledge the appeal in preventing fatigue and dullness, the advertisement doesn't fully captivate me. While it prompts interest and a willingness to consider or try, additional brand credibility and more compelling features would be necessary for stronger commitment.
