**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **I like the ad (Score = 4):** Neutral to mildly positive. As someone who values helpfulness but isn't overly talkative or outgoing, I appreciate an energetic appeal but it doesn’t strongly resonate.
  - **Interesting (Score = 5):** Slightly agree. The promise of staying energized and looking good is attention-grabbing, though not groundbreaking for my daily needs.
  - **Good (Score = 6):** Agree. It presents a positive image; however, the claim feels somewhat generic without concrete evidence or personal relevance.
  - **Attractive (Score = 3):** Neutral leaning slightly negative. The visuals and messaging might be attractive to some, but it doesn't profoundly connect with my values.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to purchase (Score = 2):** Disagree. Though not opposed, the appeal isn’t strong enough given other priorities in my budget.
  - **Will try to buy (Score = 2):** Neutral leaning negative. Given limited disposable income and diverse needs, I'm unlikely to make a conscious effort for this product.
  - **Consider buying (Score = 3):** Neutral. It’s on the radar but not high-priority; might consider it during sales or if needed alternatives are exhausted.

Overall, while the ad is decently appealing, my practical mindset and financial constraints lead me towards moderate interest without strong intent to purchase.
