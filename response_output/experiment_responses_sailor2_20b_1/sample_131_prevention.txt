**Evaluation Breakdown:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **I like the ad (5/7):** While talkative and generally agreeable, I find it mildly positive due to its straightforward message.
  - **Interesting:** Neutral-leaning towards slightly interesting because fatigue is a common issue, but not groundbreaking. Score = 4/7
  - **Good:** Agree that the message about preventing tiredness/dull appearance has merit; thus, relatively good advertising strategy. Score = 6/7
  - **Attractive:** Attraction isn't high due to potential clich√© messaging and lack of personal connection. Score = 3/7

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend (2/7):** Despite liking the message, I'm not strongly driven to buy due to budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND). 
  - **Try:** Neutral leaning towards cautious interest; might give it a chance if price is right. Score = 2/7
  - **Consider (3/7):** The idea resonates somewhat but not enough for immediate action. Worth considering within my budget constraints.

Overall, the ad effectively conveys its message, though personal factors like financial status and moderate skepticism temper enthusiasm towards making a purchase immediately.
