**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like:** Neutral (score of 3) — The ad is mildly engaging but doesn't strongly resonate.
   - **Interesting:** Agree (score of 4) — It does capture attention to some extent with its straightforward message.
   - **Good:** Disagree (score of 2) — While not bad, the appeal lacks depth or creativity that would make it memorable.
   - **Attractive:** Strongly Disagree (score of 1) — The ad feels generic and fails to connect emotionally.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend:** Neutral leaning towards negative (score of 2) — Not convinced enough by the ad alone to commit a purchase outright.
   - **Try:** Somewhat likely (score of 3) — Curiosity may lead me to give it a try if presented elsewhere or recommended.
   - **Consider:** Likely (score of 3) — Given my low-income constraints and practical nature, I'll consider buying in future situations where the need arises but won't prioritize immediately based on this ad.

Overall, while not entirely unappealing, the advertisement falls short due to its lack of personal connection, emotional appeal, or unique selling point. The product might still be considered under certain circumstances, but it's unlikely to prompt an immediate purchase decision for me.
