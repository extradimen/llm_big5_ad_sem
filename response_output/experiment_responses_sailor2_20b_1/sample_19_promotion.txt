**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (score=5):** I find the ad pleasant and engaging due to its emphasis on staying energized and looking best, which aligns with my preference for a healthy lifestyle.
   - **Interesting (score=6):** The message appeals because maintaining energy and appearance is relevant across various social contexts in Southeast Asia.
   - **Good (score=4):** While the core benefits are clear, some parts of the ad might feel slightly overhyped, leading to a moderate positive view rather than strong agreement.
   - **Attractive (score=3):** The visual and messaging strategy is somewhat attractive but lacks personal connection due to my reserved nature; I prefer more tangible evidence.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase (score=2):** While the idea resonates, it's not a top priority for me at present given other commitments.
   - **Try to Buy (score=3):** The ad prompts some curiosity but doesn't drive immediate action; I might consider sampling after discussing with family or seeing more reviews.
   - **Consider Buying (score=3):** The product remains on my radar, indicating that it could be an option if circumstances align and there's credible feedback from trusted sources.

In summary, the advertisement has a moderate positive impact due to its alignment with health-conscious values but falls short in converting strong intent into immediate action. Personal reservations and cautious nature influence these responses.
