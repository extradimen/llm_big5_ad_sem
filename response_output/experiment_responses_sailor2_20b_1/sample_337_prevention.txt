**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like:** Neutral (4): While not strongly positive, it doesn't immediately turn me off due to its claim of addressing common feelings like tiredness and dull appearance.
   - **Interesting:** Disagree (3): The message is straightforward but lacks creativity or novelty; hence, I find it somewhat uninteresting.
   - **Good:** Strongly Disagree (2): It comes across as overly simplistic with vague promises that may not align well with my preferences for detailed information and credibility.
   - **Attractive:** Disagree (3): The appeal of the ad is minimal due to its lackluster presentation, which doesn't match my personal taste or urgency.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend:** Neutral (5): I am not strongly motivated but acknowledge that addressing fatigue and appearance can be important; hence, it's on a neutral scale.
   - **Try:** Neutral (4): Thereâ€™s enough curiosity to give the product a trial run if there were more compelling details or reviews backing its effectiveness.
   - **Consider:** Disagree (3): Without stronger evidence of benefits or personal relevance beyond the generic claim, my inclination to actively consider purchasing it is low.

In summary, while the ad targets common issues effectively, its execution falls short in engaging me personally. The balance between practicality and persuasive appeal needs improvement for a higher likelihood of influencing purchase intent.
