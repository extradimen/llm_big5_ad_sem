**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad (Score = 4)** - While not strongly negative, I find it somewhat appealing given its straightforward message but lack of engagement.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score = 3)** - It's average; while highlighting consequences can be effective, it doesnâ€™t captivate me significantly.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score = 5)** - Its preventive approach resonates slightly more with my need for health and energy.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score = 2)** - The appeal isn't strong; I prefer ads that are visually or emotionally engaging.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score = 3)** - Neutral, as prevention is important but not a decisive factor alone.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score = 2)** - Somewhat skeptical due to other priorities and the need for more personal relevance.
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score = 1)** - Low intention; I may think about it but am unlikely to act without further convincing factors.

Overall, while the ad addresses a practical concern, its execution is not compelling enough given my personality traits and lifestyle. Emphasis on thoroughness in work contrasts with less engagement for this type of advertisement. Hence, moderate interest but low intent to purchase.
