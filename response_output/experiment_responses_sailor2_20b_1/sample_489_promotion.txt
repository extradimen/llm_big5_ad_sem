**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - I like the ad (Score: 3): Neutral appreciation; it's decent but not particularly exciting.
   - Think it's interesting (Score: 4): Somewhat engaging as a blue-collar worker looking for energy, though not groundbreaking.
   - Believe it is good (Score: 5): Moderately positive because staying energized aligns with daily needs, but high expectations remain cautious.
   - Find it attractive (Score: 4): It looks visually appealing and might catch attention, but lacks strong emotional connection.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2): Strongly Disagree; personal financial constraints ($36Mâ€“$45M VND/month) and limited disposable income impact willingness.
   - Will try to buy the product (Score: 2): Slightly higher interest due to needing energy boosts, but not a priority purchase item.
   - Will consider buying it (Score: 3): Neutral consideration; despite worries about budgeting, there is acknowledgment of its potential benefits for daily life. 

In summary, while I appreciate the ad's message and aesthetics, my realistic constraints lead me toward more cautious and moderate purchasing intentions. The product aligns with needs but doesn't drive an immediate purchase decision given current financial priorities.
