**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like (3/7):**
   - As a person who values helpfulness but tends to be somewhat reserved, I find aspects of the ad appealing due to its focus on wellness benefits; however, it doesn't fully align with my more introverted nature.
   
2. **Interesting (4/7):** 
   - The promise of staying energized is intriguing and relatable for maintaining daily productivity, making it moderately engaging.

3. **Good (5/7):**
   - It presents a clear value proposition, which generally resonates well with my tendency to appreciate thoroughness in product information.
   
4. **Attractive (2/7):** 
   - While the concept is good, I find the overall presentation slightly underwhelming. The focus on appearance isn't highly appealing given my strong personal values and practical mindset.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to Purchase (6/7):**
   - Despite some reservations about its marketing style, the benefits of energy and wellness are compelling enough for me to seriously consider making a purchase.

2. **Will Try to Buy (7/7):** 
   - Given my planning-oriented nature and high intention, I am quite motivated to try it out despite occasional concerns with how easily nervous or worried situations might arise post-purchase.

3. **Will Consider Buying (7/7):**
   - The product aligns closely enough with both personal needs and values that considering this purchase is very likely, even if initial excitement isn't overwhelming.

In summary, while the advertisement could be more tailored to my reserved yet practical preferences, its benefits are compelling enough to drive a strong intent towards purchasing or trying it. Balance between skepticism and motivation ensures high consideration scores despite moderate attractiveness levels.
