**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
  - I like the ad (4/7): The claim of staying energized and looking good is appealing, but it doesn't fully engage me.
  - Interesting (3/7): The message is standard; nothing groundbreaking or particularly innovative stands out to me. 
  - Good (2/7): While not outright negative, I don’t find the ad's promises compelling enough given my practical nature and skepticism about generic health claims.
  - Attractive (5/7): Despite reservations, it’s moderately appealing because of its basic but essential benefits for daily life.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - Intend to purchase this product (1/7): My current focus is on budget management, and given my monthly income range (26,000,000–35,000,000 VND), I prioritize more necessary expenses.
  - Will try to buy the product (2/7): Might consider giving it a shot if priced competitively or bundled with offers, but not driven by enthusiasm alone.
  - Consider buying this product (3/7): There’s mild consideration for occasional purchase as long as value matches benefits and doesn’t disrupt my financial planning. 

Overall, while the ad resonates moderately, personal traits like being careful with spending and lacking strong excitement towards such products lead to lower intention scores. Practicality overrides allure in decision-making.
