**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **I like the ad (Score: 4):** As a talkative and outgoing individual with strong social tendencies, I appreciate energetic messaging. However, it doesn't strongly resonate.
  - **Interesting (Score: 5):** The promise of staying energized and looking good is engaging, especially given my sociable nature but not overwhelmingly so.
  - **Believe the ad is good (Score: 6):** My strong trust in others leads me to think it has credibility. However, reservation about health claims balances this out slightly.
  - **Attractive (Score: 3):** While visually appealing ads could work, I'm more practical and less inclined towards immediate attraction.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to purchase (Score: 2):** My tendency toward carelessness makes me hesitant. The product's benefits seem useful but not compelling enough for a strong intention.
  - **Will try to buy it (Score: 3):** It might intrigue me to give it a shot, especially if offered at an affordable price within my income range (<15,000,000 VND).
  - **Consider buying it (Score: 3):** Overall, I'm open to considering the purchase based on trust in its claims and potential value despite reservations.

This balance reflects a somewhat positive yet cautious attitude towards both the ad and purchasing intent.
