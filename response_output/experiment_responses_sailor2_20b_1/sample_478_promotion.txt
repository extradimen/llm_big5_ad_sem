**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
   - **Like**: Neutral (3). As a civil servant with high standards, I find it generally acceptable but not particularly appealing based on personal preferences.
   - **Interesting**: Agree (4). The promise of staying energized and looking best is an engaging angle for maintaining productivity in my role.
   - **Good**: Strongly Agree (5). Emphasizing well-being aligns with values like being thorough, planning, and wanting to maintain a good appearance at work and socially.
   - **Attractive**: Disagree (2). The visual or tone of the ad may not strongly resonate since I'm neither talkative nor outgoing.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend**: Consider (3). While I acknowledge its benefits, direct intention to buy is moderate due to other priorities.
   - **Try**: Try (4). Given my commitment to maintaining health and efficiency, there's a willingness to give it a trial run.
   - **Consider**: Strongly Consider (5). My balanced approach values new ideas and effective solutions; hence, I will seriously evaluate the product for its potential benefits. 

Overall, while not overly swayed by the advertisement presentation, the core message aligns with my goals of productivity and well-being, leading to moderate-to-strong consideration towards purchasing.
