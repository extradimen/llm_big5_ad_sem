3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5)** - It effectively communicates a need, though not in an exceptional manner for me personally.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)** - This feels slightly manipulative and leans more towards fear-mongering than genuinely attracting my interest.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 4)** - There’s a slight nudge, but not enough for a strong commitment.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 4)** - Curiosity might lead me to give it a trial, especially if the price fits my budget and convenience is good.
