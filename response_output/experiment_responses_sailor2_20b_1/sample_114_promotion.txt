**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude towards the Ad**: 
  - Despite having a reserved and somewhat critical personality, some aspects of the ad resonate. The promise of energy might be appealing to someone in my line of work, but overall, it comes off as overly glossy and aspirational, which doesn’t fully align with my practical needs or emotional stability.
  
- **Purchase Intention**:
  - Given my monthly income constraints (<15,000,000 VND), I'm highly cost-conscious. The product might be beyond my budget on a regular basis.
  - While the idea of staying energized is beneficial for work, there's no immediate compelling reason to buy when simpler and cheaper alternatives exist (e.g., water, balanced diet).
  - **Consideration**: Neutral due to mixed feelings but not strong intent.

Ultimately, while I appreciate the intention behind the ad, it doesn't significantly influence my decision-making process or daily priorities. The perceived value isn’t enough to outweigh practical concerns about cost and necessity in my current lifestyle.
