**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores**
   - I Like the Ad (Score = 3): Itâ€™s slightly positive but not strongly so.
     - Being a generally trusting individual and valuing helpfulness, I appreciate energy drinks' potential benefits for daily routine.
   
   - I Think the Ad is Interesting (Score = 4): Neutral leaning towards agreeable.
     - The concept of staying energized resonates somewhat, especially as someone who works hard.

   - I Believe the Ad is Good (Score = 5): Agreeing but cautiously optimistic.
     - As a balanced person with an active imagination and some artistic interests, it holds promise without overwhelming me.

   - I Find the Ad Attractive (Score = 2): Disagree slightly.
     - The visual and messaging could be more relatable to my personal lifestyle as a blue-collar worker. It feels somewhat aspirational but not entirely relevant or realistic for day-to-day challenges.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores**
   - I Intend to Purchase This Product (Score = 3): Neutral leaning towards consideration.
     - While recognizing its potential, the cost and budget constraints mean immediate purchase intent is low.

   - I Will Try to Buy This Product (Score = 4): Likely will give it a try if affordable or during specific needs periods.
     - Given my strong agreement with being helpful and reliable in making plans, trying out might fit temporary requirements for extra energy boosts.

   - I Will Consider Buying this Product (Score = 2): Disagree slightly but open to reconsideration.
     - Considering its relevance to maintaining daily productivity, it's not a priority item now. However, under special circumstances or with discounts, the product may come into consideration.

Overall, while appreciating the ad's positive messaging and potential benefits, practical constraints (cost, budget) coupled with slight reservations about relatability lead to moderate scores on both attitude and purchase intention. Balance between trust in wellness products and pragmatic considerations are key factors influencing my evaluation.
