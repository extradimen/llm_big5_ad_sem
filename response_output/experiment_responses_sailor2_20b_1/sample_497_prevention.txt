**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
   - **Like:** Neutral (3) — While not strongly engaging, it's moderately acceptable.
   - **Interesting:** Somewhat Agree (4) — The ad concept is intriguing but doesn’t excite me much.
   - **Good:** Agree (5) — It conveys a clear benefit effectively; however, nothing groundbreaking.
   - **Attractive:** Disagree (2) — The overall presentation lacks appeal for my taste.

- **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Agree (4) — I recognize the potential value but am not compelled strongly enough to buy right away.
   - **Will Try to Buy:** Neutral (3) — There’s a slight inclination, especially if it aligns with occasional fatigue relief needs.
   - **Consider Buying:** Slightly Agree (2) — It's on my radar for future consideration or when needed.

In summary, the ad effectively communicates its message but doesn't fully resonate due to modest presentation and personal preference. I'm open to considering purchasing based on perceived benefits without strong emotional pull.
