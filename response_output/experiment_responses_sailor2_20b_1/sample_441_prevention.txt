**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like (2)**: While not strongly disagreeing, I find it somewhat lackluster due to its generic and overused claims about energy.
2. **Interesting (3)**: Neutral leaning towards mildly engaging but nothing groundbreaking or innovative.
3. **Good (4)**: The ad's message is straightforward yet uninspired; hence, just above average in terms of quality.
4. **Attractive (1)**: Given my reserved nature and sometimes nervous disposition, the promise might seem forced rather than genuinely appealing.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase (2)**: I'm not driven enough by these claims alone since similar products are numerous, and personal experience matters more.
2. **Try to buy (3)**: There is a slight curiosity but no strong pull; might consider trying it once out of mild interest or convenience.
3. **Consider buying (4)**: Given my helpful nature and occasional need for energy boosts at work, I'm somewhat open to considering it if recommended by others or in an affordable price range.

Overall, while the ad makes a basic appeal, its lackluster presentation does not strongly resonate with me based on my personality traits and current circumstances. Hence, higher purchase intentions are modestly encouraged rather than driven purely by the advertisement.
