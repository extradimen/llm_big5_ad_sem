**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - I like the ad (Score: 3): It's neutral; it doesn't resonate strongly but isnâ€™t disliked either.
   - I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4): The concept slightly grabs my attention, but not exceptionally so.
   - I believe the ad is good (Score: 2): While decently crafted, its messaging feels somewhat overhyped and lacks strong evidence to support claims.
   - I find the ad attractive (Score: 3): It's visually appealing but doesn't fully engage me emotionally or logically.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1): Strongly disagree; even though it highlights a common issue, my skepticism about efficacy and value makes a strong intention unlikely.
   - I will try to buy this product (Score: 2): Mild curiosity might lead me to consider trying once, but not with high conviction.
   - I will consider buying this product (Score: 3): The neutral interest is there; it's something that could be considered if other factors align positively.

Overall, while the ad captures a problem well and has some visual appeal, my trust issues, critical thinking, and practical considerations lead me to a cautious outlook towards purchasing. Hence, moderately positive yet balanced responses reflect these aspects.
