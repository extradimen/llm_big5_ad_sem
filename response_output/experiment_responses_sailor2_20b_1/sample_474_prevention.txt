**Evaluation Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - *Like (3):* The ad is average; it doesn't evoke strong emotions but isn’t off-putting either.
  - *Interesting (2):* While preventive ads can be informative, this one lacks creativity and feels somewhat generic, hence a lower score.
  - *Good (4):* It conveys the message clearly about fatigue and appearance impact, which is decent enough to consider it good but not outstanding.
  - *Attractive (5):* The concept of looking refreshed appeals slightly, making it moderately attractive.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *Intend (1):* Although I appreciate preventive health messages, the ad lacks a strong call-to-action and personal relevance for me to intend immediate purchase.
  - *Try (2):* There's some mild curiosity about trying since fatigue is relatable; however, it doesn't compel an urgent trial.
  - *Consider (3):* It nudges consideration if I notice physical changes or need a boost but isn’t a priority given other financial constraints and my lifestyle.

Overall, the ad aligns with preventive health awareness without being persuasive enough to drive immediate action. The neutral-to-mild responses reflect its relevance without strong motivational impact in this demographic scenario.
