**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - *Like (5/7):* While I appreciate the intention behind promoting energy and appearance improvement, it feels somewhat generic.
  - *Interesting (4/7):* The claim is appealing but lacks unique selling points that would grab my attention strongly.
  - *Good (3/7):* As a civil servant prioritizing efficiency, the message is decent; however, more compelling evidence or personal connection would make it stronger.
  - *Attractive (6/7):* The overall presentation is attractive due to its emphasis on daily benefits and positive outcomes.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend (2/7):* Despite the appeal, I'm not highly motivated to purchase right now given my current budget constraints and need for specific product assurances.
  - *Try (1/7):* Low intent due to a lack of personal connection or immediate necessity in my life.
  - *Consider (3/7):* It is noteworthy enough that I might consider it if there are reliable reviews, cost justification, or promotional offers aligning with my values and budget.

In summary, while the ad appeals moderately, practical considerations weigh heavily on whether to actually buy. My openness to social influence balances out cautious assessment of product relevance in my life right now.
