**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
  - *I like the ad (score = 5)*: While I appreciate the concept of staying energized and looking good, it doesn't overwhelmingly excite me.
  - *Interesting (4)*: The message is straightforward but not particularly novel for my preferences as a Southeast Asian professional.
  - *Good (3.5)*: It sounds credible enough, focusing on health benefits, though I feel some other aspects could be more compelling or personalized.
  - *Attractive (6)*: Visually and conceptually appealing to someone like me who values both energy levels and appearance.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *Intend to purchase (2)*: Despite the appeal, there are many competitors in this category, making it less likely I'll commit without more compelling reasons or personal need.
  - *Will try (1)*: Given my neutral-to-negative experience with similar products, trying isn't high on my priority list.
  - *Consider buying (3)*: While not immediately drawn to purchase, the ad is persuasive enough that if there are discounts or specific benefits highlighted for me (e.g., local appeal), I might consider it.

Overall, though finding some aspects attractive and believable, my strong work ethic combined with a cautious approach means higher intention isn't guaranteed. The score balances between appreciation of the message's goals and practical consumer skepticism.
