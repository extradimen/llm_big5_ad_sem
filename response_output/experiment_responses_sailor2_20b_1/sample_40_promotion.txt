**Evaluation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores (on a scale of 1-7):**
   - I like the ad: **4** – Neutral but leaning slightly positive; it resonates with my energy needs.
   - The ad is interesting: **5** – Agree, as staying energized and looking good are relevant to daily life.
   - It's a good ad: **6** – Agree because the messaging seems straightforward and appealing for someone who values performance.
   - I find it attractive: **3** – Neutral leaning towards slightly negative; my reserved nature finds some aspects not personally engaging.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores (on a scale of 1-7):**
   - Intent to purchase this product: **2** – Disagree, as budget constraints (monthly income) make regular high-priced drinks less feasible.
   - Will try the product: **2** – Neutral leaning towards slight hesitation; considering current financial limits and not strong enough promotion for an immediate trial.
   - Will consider buying it: **3** – Agree but cautiously; might consider when I have a bit more disposable income or during special offers.

In summary, while I appreciate the ad's practical message (energizing + looking good), its appeal is limited by personal finances and my cautious nature. Hence, there’s some interest without immediate commitment to purchase.
