**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**  
  - *I like the ad:* Low (2) – Despite being talkative and somewhat outgoing, there's no strong connection or excitement for a generic energy drink promise.
  - *Interesting:* Mildly Agree (3) – The concept of staying energized is familiar but not particularly captivating given my reserved nature.
  - *Good:* Neutral-ish (4) – While helpful by nature, the claim seems reasonable yet unremarkable; no strong positive feelings.
  - *Attractive:* Mildly Attractive (3) – It’s visually appealing, but overall lack of emotional stability and trust in product claims dampen enthusiasm.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
  - *Intend to purchase:* Strongly Disagree (1) – My tendency towards carelessness and nervousness means I'm cautious about making purchases based on such generic promises.
  - *Try to buy:* Neutral-ish Tendency (2) – There's a slight curiosity, but not enough confidence or urgency given my low income and concerns about effectiveness.
  - *Consider buying:* Mild Consideration (3) – While open-minded due to occasional helpfulness, practical constraints and lack of strong trust make it more of an "if the opportunity arises" situation.

Overall, while I find aspects appealing at a superficial level, deeper skepticism based on my personality traits makes me reluctant to commit to purchasing without further compelling evidence or personal experience.
