**Evaluation and Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes**:  
    - **Like (5)**: The advertisement resonates with me to some extent due to its focus on feeling tired and looking dull—common concerns among people who lead busy lives.
    - **Interesting (4)**: It's mildly interesting, though not incredibly engaging. The message is straightforward but lacks emotional depth or creativity that might appeal more strongly.
    - **Good (6)**: I find the concept of preventing fatigue and maintaining appearance appealing; it aligns with my desire for personal well-being.
    - **Attractive (5)**: Overall attractiveness falls in a middle range because while it addresses real issues, its execution could be improved to better capture attention.

- **Purchase Intentions**:  
    - **Intend (3)**: While I appreciate the ad's message, there isn’t enough compelling evidence or personal relevance for me to feel an immediate purchase intention.
    - **Try (2)**: Given my budget constraints and skepticism towards new products without prior experience, trying it seems less likely unless backed by recommendations from trusted sources.
    - **Consider (4)**: The product is definitely something I would keep in mind if someone else shares positive feedback or there's a promotional offer that fits within my monthly income limit.

In summary, the ad successfully touches on concerns related to fatigue and appearance but needs stronger execution to drive higher purchase intentions. My cautious yet open-minded approach leads to moderate consideration rather than immediate action.
