**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:** 
  - *Like*: Neutral, as while energizing and appearance are appealing concepts, my reserved nature makes me cautious about instant attraction to promotions.
  - *Interesting*: Disagree slightly. The focus seems generic; there's nothing particularly intriguing or unique in its pitch for a busy office worker like myself.
  - *Good*: Neutral, the claims of energy boost and looking good align with personal needs but don't strongly resonate without specific details on effectiveness.
  - *Attractive*: Strongly Disagree, due to my reserved nature. The ad's visuals might not capture my attention enough for immediate appeal.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *Intend*: Consider (3), I'm not convinced based solely on the advertisement but am open to exploring more information.
  - *Try*: Consider (3), willingness is there if it aligns with budget and offers clear benefits over time.
  - *Consider*: Neutral (4), overall, the product warrants further investigation as its potential health/energy perks are valued in my lifestyle.

Given my reserved nature, thorough but cautious approach, and a preference for balanced decision-making, I lean toward neutral to slightly positive attitudes towards this ad while maintaining realistic intentions regarding purchase. More detailed information would be crucial before making an actual buying choice.
