**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** (Score: 2) - While I appreciate straightforward messaging in ads, this particular message feels somewhat overplayed and cliché; thus, it doesn't evoke strong positive feelings.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score: 3) - The idea of avoiding tiredness or dull looks can be engaging, but the simplicity makes it lack novelty for someone with a postgraduate education who values thoughtful communication.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score: 4) - Functionally, it serves its purpose clearly by highlighting negative consequences if you don't use their product, which aligns well in terms of messaging clarity and target concerns.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score: 2) - My strong tendency towards sociability means I prefer ads with a more engaging or creative approach rather than a direct scare tactic.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score: 1) - The persuasive tone isn't compelling enough given my preference for thoroughness and thoughtful decision-making, especially since it lacks specific benefits beyond generalized fatigue relief.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score: 1) - Given my tendency towards carelessness in planning, I'm unlikely to proactively seek out new products based on such a standard appeal without more compelling reasons or personal need confirmation.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score: 2) - While the ad might prompt mild curiosity, it doesn’t inspire strong consideration due to my generally critical and emotionally stable nature that seeks evidence beyond just potential consequences.

Overall, while acknowledging its straightforward effectiveness in conveying a negative consequence, I find it lacks sufficient allure or personal relevance for serious purchase intent. Hence, low scores reflect this balanced critique.
