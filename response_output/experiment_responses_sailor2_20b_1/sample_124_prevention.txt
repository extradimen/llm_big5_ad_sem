**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement (7-point scale):**
  - **Like:** Neutral to slightly agree (scored a 3) – The ad's messaging is clear but not particularly appealing.
  - **Interesting:** Somewhat interesting (scored a 4) – It grabs attention due to its prevention aspect, though not compellingly so.
  - **Good:** Agreeable (scored a 5) – Logically structured and relevant in highlighting potential consequences of lacking energy or vitality.
  - **Attractive:** Neutral leaning towards negative (scored a 2) – The visual appeal isn't strong enough to make the ad stand out; more focus needed on design.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to Purchase:** Strongly disagree (1) – Despite understanding the benefits, there's no immediate drive or urgency to buy.
  - **Try to Buy:** Neutral leaning towards agree (3) – I might consider giving it a try but not with full commitment.
  - **Consider Buying:** Agreeable (4) – The product is on my radar and may be worth evaluating if other factors align, such as price point or brand reputation.

Overall, while the ad effectively communicates its message about potential drawbacks of skipping the drink, personal preference for subtler approaches and practical considerations over aesthetics impact both attitude and purchase intention. More engaging elements could improve appeal without compromising credibility.
