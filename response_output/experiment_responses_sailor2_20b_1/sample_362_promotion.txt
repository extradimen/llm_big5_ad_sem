**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Attitudinal Scores:**
    - **Like (6):** As a talkative and outgoing individual, I appreciate an energetic ad that resonates with maintaining vitality, though it doesn't strongly excite me.
    - **Interesting (5):** The concept of staying energized is appealing; however, the cliché nature slightly dampens my interest.
    - **Good (4.5):** Neutral and generally trusting, I acknowledge its credibility but don’t find it particularly groundbreaking or innovative.
    - **Attractive (3):** While visually engaging ads can work, this one feels too generic for me to be strongly drawn.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    - **Intend to Purchase (2.5):** Despite an agreeable attitude, my postgraduate degree and careful nature make me hesitant without further product details or reviews.
    - **Try the Product (2):** Mild curiosity is present but not enough to push immediate action; more information would be required.
    - **Consider Buying (1.5):** I remain open-minded but won’t prioritize it over other purchases given my monthly income constraints and lack of strong emotional connection.

In summary, while acknowledging its positive aspects, the ad falls short in compelling me due to generic messaging and a need for more substantial proof or benefits tailored to my lifestyle as a young civil servant. Therefore, purchase intent remains low.
