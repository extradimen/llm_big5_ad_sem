**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - I like the ad (score 2): Neutral but leaning slightly towards liking it due to its relevance.
  - The ad is interesting (score 3): Somewhat engaging; addresses concerns about fatigue and appearance which are pertinent for my age group and lifestyle.
  - It's a good ad (score 4): Agrees on some level, as the message aligns with maintaining vitality but lacks emotional depth or originality to be strongly appreciated.
  - Attractive (score 3): Moderately attractive due to its clear call-to-action without being overly flashy.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - I intend to purchase this product (score 5): While not a high intent, the ad triggers some consideration given my busy managerial role and desire for energy.
  - Will try to buy this product (score 6): Encouraged by its promise of enhanced alertness; willing to give it a trial run.
  - Consider buying (score 7): The overall message resonates enough that I'm seriously considering adding the drink to my routine, balancing convenience with efficacy. 

This balanced approach reflects my pragmatic nature and commitment to maintaining health without being swayed by superficial aspects of advertising.
