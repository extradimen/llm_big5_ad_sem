**Explanation:**

### Attitudes towards the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (4/7):**
   - While I appreciate its straightforward message and relevance to feeling tired, my neutral-to-mildly positive response is due to personal preference for more engaging content.

2. **I think the ad is interesting (3/7):**
   - The claim about potential fatigue ties in with daily experiences but lacks creativity that would truly catch my attention; hence, it feels somewhat routine.

3. **I believe the ad is good (2/7):**
   - Functionally informative yet simplistic, missing nuanced or compelling elements to convince me completely of its effectiveness.

4. **I find the ad attractive (3/7):**
   - Neutral leaning towards agreeable; it has some appeal due to relatability but doesn't stand out significantly given my preference for more dynamic messaging.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (5/7):**
   - The message resonates enough with my practical concerns about fatigue, making me consider the solution, even though it's not a compelling deal-breaker alone.

2. **I will try to buy this product (6/7):**
   - Slight inclination towards trying based on its promise of addressing a common issue and the reliability implied by good design execution or brand reputation.

3. **I will consider buying this product (7/7):**
   - Considering factors like overall health, work productivity, and existing financial constraints; I'm open to making an informed purchase decision after further evaluation. 

Overall, while not exceptionally persuasive due to my cautious nature and neutral sociability, the ad triggers enough interest for me to seriously entertain a potential buy if other conditions (e.g., reviews, brand trust) align positively.
