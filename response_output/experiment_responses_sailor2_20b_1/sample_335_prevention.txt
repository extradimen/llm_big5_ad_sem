**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**  
  - **Like (3/7):** I find it mildly agreeable but not overwhelmingly appealing.
  - **Interesting (4/7):** The ad is somewhat engaging; it taps into common concerns about energy levels and appearance, which resonates to an extent.
  - **Good (5/7):** It presents a valid point, albeit slightly overemphasized. I believe the message can be effective but might come off as too direct for some tastes.
  - **Attractive (2/7):** While it has potential appeal, there are better ways to present its benefits more subtly and convincingly.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
  - **Intend (2/7):** Not a strong intention; I appreciate the idea but don't feel compelled enough to buy immediately.
  - **Try (1/7):** Low likelihood of trying it, as there's no compelling urgency or emotional connection driving immediate action.
  - **Consider (3/7):** There is some consideration due to my generally trusting nature and openness to new products that promise energy enhancement. However, the ad needs more substance for a stronger decision.

Overall, while I find the message somewhat effective in addressing common issues related to fatigue and appearance, it lacks the persuasive power needed to drive immediate purchase behavior given my personality traits and life context. A well-rounded approach with additional evidence or testimonials might sway me further.
