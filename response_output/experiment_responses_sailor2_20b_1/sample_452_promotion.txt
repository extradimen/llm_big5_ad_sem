**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes**
    - **I like the ad (2)**: Although not strongly negative, I find it somewhat appealing but also a bit generic.
    - **I think the ad is interesting (3)**: Neutral to slightly positive; doesn't capture my attention dramatically due to overused energy and beauty claims.
    - **I believe the ad is good (4)**: More favorable; recognizes its functional aspects, even if not entirely convincing.
    - **I find the ad attractive (3)**: A bit uninspired; lacks emotional appeal or unique selling points that would truly draw me in.

- **Purchase Intention**
    - **Intend to purchase this product (1)**: Strongly disagree. Despite being a practical worker, the ad doesn't resonate enough for an immediate buy decision.
    - **Will try to buy this product (2)**: Disagree slightly; curiosity might be piqued if it were readily available and reasonably priced but not sufficient alone.
    - **Consider buying this product (3)**: Slightly agree. Might ponder it as part of my daily routine, especially considering the need for energy boost without strong negative feelings against trying.

Overall, while the ad isn't entirely unappealing or manipulative, its appeal is limited by a lack of personal connection and unique differentiation that aligns with my cautious nature and reserved preferences.
