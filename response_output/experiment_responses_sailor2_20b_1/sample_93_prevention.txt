**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
- **Like (3/7):** Neutral leaning towards slightly positive. The ad's premise is understandable but not particularly engaging.
- **Interesting (4/7):** I find it somewhat interesting because of its direct message, though it lacks creativity or novelty to truly stand out.
- **Good (2/7):** It delivers a basic yet effective health-related warning, but the execution feels generic and uninspired.
- **Attractive (3/7):** Slightly positive; the ad has an acceptable appeal due to its straightforward approach on staying energized.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend (1/7):** Strongly Disagree. The advertisement does not motivate me enough based on my personality and lifestyle preferences.
- **Try (2/7):** Neutral leaning towards slight curiosity, but this doesn't translate into a strong desire to try the product immediately.
- **Consider (1/7):** Strongly Disagree. Despite some awareness of potential benefits, I donâ€™t see myself making an active decision to buy it in the near future given my priorities and current financial constraints.

In summary, while acknowledging the ad's informational value on preventing fatigue and dullness, its overall impact is limited by lackluster presentation and insufficient alignment with personal preferences. Therefore, purchase intention remains low despite minimal interest due to practical considerations like budget.
