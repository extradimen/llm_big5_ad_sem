**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
- **Like the ad (Score: 4)**: While I find it somewhat appealing, it's not particularly exciting given its straightforward message.
- **Interesting (Score: 5)**: It does catch my attention with a clear problem statement and solution but could be more engaging in terms of creativity.
- **Good (Score: 3)**: The ad conveys the product’s benefits effectively but lacks depth or emotional connection to fully impress me.
- **Attractive (Score: 2)**: It doesn't stand out visually; thus, I don’t find it particularly appealing.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend to purchase (Score: 2)**: While the ad suggests a benefit, my current lifestyle and budget constraints make an immediate buy less likely.
- **Will try to buy (Score: 3)**: There's enough incentive for potential future consideration if other factors align positively.
- **Consider buying (Score: 1)**: Despite finding some value in the advertisement, external priorities and cost affect my desire to actually purchase it.

Overall, while I appreciate its directness and relevance, the ad lacks sufficient emotional resonance or creative flair to strongly motivate a purchase decision. However, it does spark mild curiosity for future evaluation.
