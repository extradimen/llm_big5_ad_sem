**Evaluation and Rationale:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
- **Like (5/7):**
  - Neutral talkativeness means I'm open to positive messaging but am not particularly drawn by excitement.
  
- **Interesting (4/7):**
  - The promise of energy and looking good is appealing, yet it feels somewhat generic.

- **Good (3/7):**
  - While the core message resonates with everyday needs, there's a lack of compelling detail or unique selling points for strong belief.

- **Attractive (4/7):**
  - It’s visually and conceptually okay but doesn't captivate me due to its common ground in health/beauty claims.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend (2/7):**
  - Despite needing energy, my current budget constraints make this a low priority. I’m practical about spending.
  
- **Try (2/7):**
  - There's slight curiosity but not enough motivation to break my usual purchasing patterns due to limited proof of effectiveness.

- **Consider (1/7):**
  - Very unlikely; other priorities and cautious nature prevent serious consideration without more compelling evidence or lower pricing options. 

Overall, while I appreciate the ad’s intent, it doesn’t sufficiently align with my lifestyle choices or financial constraints, leading to a low purchase intention score. The message needs more personal relevance and tangible benefits for greater impact on me as a consumer.
