**Evaluation Details:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like (Score: 3)** - The ad's message is clear but doesn't particularly resonate with me due to my strong agreeance towards being somewhat rude and careless.
2. **Interesting (Score: 4)** - It captures attention by highlighting potential drawbacks, making it moderately interesting as a preventative health concern.
3. **Good (Score: 2)** - While not untruthful, the language is slightly exaggerated for dramatic effect, reducing its credibility in my eyes.
4. **Attractive (Score: 3)** - The ad's imagery and tone are neutral-to-acceptable but don't evoke a strong emotional response given my tendencies toward being emotionally unstable.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase (Score: 1)** - Strongly Disagree – Despite the warning, it lacks compelling evidence or personal relevance.
2. **Try to buy (Score: 2)** - Neutral/Disagree – No immediate push since I’m wary of manipulative marketing and prioritize other priorities with limited income (<15M VND).
3. **Consider buying (Score: 3)** - Slightly Agree – It might be worth considering if there are discounts or offers, but not a priority now.

Overall, the ad is effective in raising awareness about potential issues but falls short on persuading me as an individual with my specific traits and financial constraints. The balance between preventing feelings of tiredness and dull appearance doesn't sufficiently align with my current concerns or purchasing behavior.
