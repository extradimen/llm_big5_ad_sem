**Explanation:**

1. **Like the Ad (Score = 3):**
   - Neutral to slightly positive; I acknowledge its existence but don't feel particularly drawn in by it.

2. **Think the Ad is Interesting (Score = 4):**
   - It's moderately engaging, using common concerns about fatigue and appearance which can resonate with daily experiences.

3. **Believe the Ad is Good (Score = 5):**
   - Somewhat convincing; appeals to my natural tendency towards practical solutions for health and productivity issues.
   
4. **Find the Ad Attractive (Score = 2):**
   - Neutral leaning negative; lacks a compelling hook or unique angle that would make it genuinely attractive.

**Purchase Intentions:**

1. **Intend to Purchase (Score = 4):**
   - Slightly inclined but not strongly convinced just yet, as other factors like brand trust and personal need assessment will influence my decision.
   
2. **Will Try to Buy (Score = 3):**
   - A moderate attempt; the ad might prompt a trial purchase if paired with positive reviews or promotions.

3. **Consider Buying (Score = 4):**
   - Likely on the shortlist for consideration, given the relevance of its message but not guaranteed without additional reassurances about quality and reliability.

Overall, while the ad presents an understandable benefit related to energy levels and appearance, it doesn't entirely captivate or convince me due to a lack of compelling branding or emotional connection. Hence, I'm open but cautious in my approach towards purchasing this product.
