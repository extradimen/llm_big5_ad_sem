**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (5)**: Neutral, as the ad's promise of energy and appearance improvement resonates but doesn’t particularly excite me due to my neutral talkativeness.
   - **Interesting (4)**: Agree because highlighting daily benefits is engaging for someone who prioritizes practicality (e.g., a student).
   - **Good (3)**: Disagree, as it lacks specific details about ingredients or scientifically-backed claims—essential trust factors for me.
   - **Attractive (4)**: Agree; the visuals and messaging make it visually appealing.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase (2)**: Low agreement because personal needs aren't urgent, and better-informed decisions are preferred over impulsive buys.
   - **Try Buying (3)**: Neutral-leaning agree since trying a new drink seems low-risk but not essential given current alternatives.
   - **Consider Buying (4)**: Slightly higher likelihood to consider based on attractive messaging; however, further research into efficacy and cost will drive the final decision.

In summary, while appreciating its visual appeal and engagement, I find it necessary to verify claims before committing. This cautious yet open approach reflects my trustworthy nature and rational decision-making process as a young married student with balanced priorities.
