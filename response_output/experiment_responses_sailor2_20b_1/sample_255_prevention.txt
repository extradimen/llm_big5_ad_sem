**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad**: Neutral (Score: 3) - The claim seems straightforward and relevant to daily life but lacks unique appeal.
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: Agree (Score: 4) - It piques curiosity about maintaining energy levels, which resonates with my need for sustained productivity as a managerial employee.
3. **I believe the ad is good**: Neutral (Score: 3) - While it presents an effective message, there's not enough compelling evidence or emotional connection to consider it top-notch.
4. **I find the ad attractive**: Disagree (Score: 2) - The focus on negatives ("tired" and "dull") may be off-putting for someone who generally prefers positive messaging.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product**: Neutral/Conditional (Score: 3) – I recognize its potential benefits but need more information about quality, ingredients, and reviews.
2. **Will try to buy the product**: Unsure/Cautious (Score: 2) - The ad is persuasive enough for a trial if it fits within my budget and aligns with other health-related investments.
3. **Consider buying this product** – Low Interest (Score: 1): Despite some interest, given its relatively high cost (>46 million VND/month), I need more compelling reasons or evidence of effectiveness before committing to purchase.

In summary, while the ad is somewhat engaging and relevant, it does not significantly drive a strong immediate intent to buy due to reservations about messaging style, personal preference for positive reinforcement, and financial consideration.
