**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitudes (7-point scale):**
   - **I like the ad:** *2* — While not strongly positive, it resonates somewhat due to its straightforward appeal.
   - **Interesting:** *4* — The claim is clear and attention-grabbing, making it moderately interesting.
   - **Good:** *3* — Neutral leaning towards slightly favorable; credible enough but lacks emotional depth for strong appreciation.
   - **Attractive:** *5* — The ad's visual or messaging might not be exceptionally attractive but effectively conveys the product benefit.

2. **Purchase Intention (7-point scale):**
   - **Intend to purchase:** *4* — There’s a moderate intention driven by its preventive promise, though it doesn’t inspire immediate urgency.
   - **Will try to buy:** *6* — Given my generally trusting and thorough nature, I'm inclined to give it a shot based on the potential benefits stated.
   - **Consider buying:** *6* — The compelling message encourages consideration; while not a guaranteed purchase, there's significant interest in exploring its effectiveness. 

Overall, the ad holds practical appeal but lacks an emotional hook or creative flair that might elevate my immediate desire to buy. However, it aligns with preventive health interests and is likely seen as credible enough for further exploration.
