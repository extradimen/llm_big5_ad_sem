**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad**: Neutral (3) - While it's attention-grabbing, my strong agreement with having an active imagination and originality means I appreciate creative messaging, but this particular claim feels a bit too generalized.
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: Agree (4) - The prevention aspect taps into common concerns about energy levels and appearance, making it moderately engaging.
3. **I believe the ad is good**: Somewhat Neutral/Agree (5) - It conveys a clear message but lacks depth or compelling evidence that resonates strongly with my background as an office worker focused on results rather than instant fixes.
4. **I find the ad attractive**: Disagree (2) - The claim feels manipulative and doesn't align well with my cautious, thorough nature in evaluating health benefits.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: Strongly Disagree (1) - Given its broad appeal without concrete details about efficacy or trustworthiness, I'm not inclined towards immediate action.
2. **I will try to buy this product**: Neutral/Disagree (2) - There's some curiosity but a low threshold for trying due to my tendency toward thoroughness and skepticism in making health decisions.
3. **I will consider buying this product**: Agree (3) - The ad piques mild interest, so I'm open to considering it further if accompanied by credible evidence or recommendations from trusted sources.

Overall, while the advertisement is somewhat engaging and interesting, its lack of compelling details about efficacy and my cautious nature lead me to a low purchase intention. Nonetheless, there's room for consideration with additional information.
