**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (Score: 4):** While talkative, I don't find it overly engaging but appreciate its straightforward message.
   - **Interesting (Score: 3):** The concept of staying energized is appealing to a busy blue-collar worker, yet the presentation lacks novelty for me.
   - **Good (Score: 5):** As someone who values practicality and functionality, I think it can benefit my daily routine positively.
   - **Attractive (Score: 2):** The ad might not stand out visually or emotionally; its simplicity may seem bland.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase (Score: 3):** It aligns with personal needs, but the perceived value and monthly income constraints slightly hold me back.
   - **Try to Buy (Score: 3):** I'm open-minded enough to try it given its benefits for energy and appearance, despite budget concerns.
   - **Consider Buying (Score: 3):** There's a definite consideration; my helpful nature means weighing potential improvements in work performance is important.

Overall, the advertisement effectively targets practical needs but lacks sufficient allure or emotional connection. The balanced scores reflect cautious optimism while acknowledging financial considerations and individual preferences.
