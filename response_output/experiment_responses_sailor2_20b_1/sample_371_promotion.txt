**Evaluation and Justification:**

**Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
1. **Like (5)**: I generally find it pleasant but not overwhelmingly so.
   - Being talkative and sociable makes me open to energetic products, yet my reserved nature means high enthusiasm isn't natural.

2. **Interesting (4)**: The concept of staying energized is appealing, particularly for a blue-collar worker needing stamina.
   - My active imagination sees the idea as plausible but doesn’t generate immense excitement on its own.

3. **Good (6)**: It presents clear benefits—energy and looking good—which align with basic lifestyle goals without any glaring flaws.
   - Strongly trusting nature inclines me to believe in positive health claims, bolstering my impression of the ad’s quality.

4. **Attractive (5)**: The message is visually and emotionally resonant but not exceptionally so due to being a balanced mix of necessity and aesthetics.
   - My agreeable yet somewhat reserved personality finds it appealing without overwhelming enthusiasm.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **Intend (3)**: While the ad makes an impression, strong intent isn't immediate given practical considerations like budget constraints and other priorities.
   - Monthly income range limits frivolous spending; I prioritize essential items first despite liking the idea of improved energy levels.

2. **Try (2)**: Lowered score due to cautiousness—despite believing in the benefits, actual purchase would be conditional on trying samples or further research.
   - Thorough job attitude means verifying product efficacy before committing fully.

3. **Consider (4)**: The ad definitely nudges me towards considering this drink when making future purchasing decisions.
   - Originality and helpful nature prompt a mindful evaluation of the product's long-term value for health and well-being.

Overall, while I appreciate the message’s appeal to my needs as a hardworking individual, practical considerations keep purchase intent balanced but open. The ad is effective in prompting contemplation rather than an immediate buy.
