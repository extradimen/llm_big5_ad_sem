**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **Like the ad**: I don’t strongly dislike but also find it neutral (scored a 3). It’s an average appeal.
2. **Interesting**: The message is somewhat interesting to me (scoring a 4).
3. **Believe it's good**: My skepticism about health claims nudges this score lower at 2, due to general distrust and lack of strong evidence presented in the ad.
4. **Attractive**: Given my reserved nature and tendency not to be easily swayed, I find it unattractive (scored a 1).

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase**: No immediate intent given concerns about product efficacy and personal lifestyle choices (2).
2. **Try to buy the product**: Neutral inclination; willing to explore if offered an opportunity or discount but not actively seeking (2). 
3. **Consider buying it**: Will consider under certain conditions like recommendations from trusted sources, more credible information, or special offers (scored a 3).

Overall, while I appreciate some aspects of the ad’s message and its preventative nature aligns with my values, there's a lack of compelling reason to take immediate action based on current assessment. Therefore, moderate engagement without strong intent.
