**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 4)** - While I appreciate its energy-focused message, my reserved nature means it doesn't excite me strongly.
   
2. **Interesting (Score: 5)** - The idea of staying energized resonates due to my career demands but could be more compelling with specific details or benefits.

3. **Good (Score: 6)** - Generally positive because the message aligns with maintaining productivity, though lack of trust in quick fixes slightly lowers enthusiasm.
   
4. **Attractive (Score: 3)** - Not highly attractive; the promise of looking "best every day" feels overgeneralized and may not connect deeply due to my tendency towards realism.

### Purchase Intentions:
1. **Intend to purchase (Score: 2)** - Low intention despite being a civil servant needing energy boosts, owing to skepticism about immediate effects without further proof.
   
2. **Try to buy (Score: 4)** - Neutral-to-positive intent; it's worth giving a try since my job requires staying energized and I appreciate the effort in product marketing.

3. **Consider buying (Score: 3)** - Likely to consider, especially when combined with occasional reviews or recommendations from peers who might share similar values but may hesitate due to personal budget constraints.

Overall, while there's moderate interest and some intention to explore the product, credibility gaps and my reserved skepticism affect higher scores on both attitudes and purchase intentions.
