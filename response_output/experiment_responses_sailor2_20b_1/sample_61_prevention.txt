**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement
- **I like the ad:** Neutral. The message about feeling tired and looking dull might resonate, but it doesn't excite me.
- **Interesting:** Disagree. It lacks novelty or a compelling hook to engage my attention as an introverted student focused on studies.
- **Good:** Strongly Disagree. While I understand its intended purpose, the appeal feels shallow compared to other informational content I value more.
- **Attractive:** Disagree. The ad's overall presentation does not capture my interest given my reserved nature and current priorities.

### Purchase Intention
- **Intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree. Given my financial situation (monthly income of 36,000,000â€“45,000,000 VND) and emphasis on academics over lifestyle products, I prioritize essential items.
- **Will try to buy it:** Strongly Disagree. Without a compelling reason or urgency, there's no motivation to experiment with this product.
- **Consider buying it:** Strongly Disagree. Even though the concern about fatigue is valid, other health habits and solutions are more aligned with my lifestyle and values.

Overall, while acknowledging its relevance, I find both the ad presentation unappealing and the purchase intention low due to personal priorities and limited perceived value for me as a student-focused individual in Southeast Asia.
