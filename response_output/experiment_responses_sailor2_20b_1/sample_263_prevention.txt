**Evaluation and Rationale:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (score = 3)
   - As a moderately talkative individual with strong practical tendencies but not overly sociable, I find it somewhat pleasant without being particularly enthusiastic.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (score = 4)
   - The concept of preventing fatigue and dull appearance captures attention to some degree due to its relevance in daily life, especially given my managerial responsibilities.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Neutral-leaning agree (score = 5)
   - While not entirely convincing, it has a logical appeal as health maintenance products can offer tangible benefits. However, I'm cautious without concrete proof of effectiveness.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree (score = 2)
   - The presentation might lack depth or emotional connection for me; its directness feels somewhat manipulative rather than engagingly persuasive.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (score = 1)
   - Given my neutral-to-negative reaction and cautious nature, there's no strong intent without further evidence or personal need.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** Neutral (score = 2)
   - The ad has some appeal but not enough for a spontaneous purchase; I might consider trying it if recommended by someone trustworthy or in an impulse situation.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** Agree (score = 3)
   - Overall, the idea aligns with my need for wellness maintenance and work productivity. Thus, I am open to considering it but would require additional information or reassurance before committing fully. 

In summary, while the ad is moderately interesting and somewhat believable, it falls short in appealing strongly enough to drive an immediate purchase decision. My preference leans toward thoughtful consideration rather than impulse buying.
