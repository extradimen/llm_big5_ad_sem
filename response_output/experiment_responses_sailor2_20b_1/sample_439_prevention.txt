**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **I like the ad (6/7):**
   - As a talkative and outgoing individual, I appreciate persuasive messages but find this one slightly over-the-top with its dramatic claims.
   
2. **The ad is interesting (5/7):**
   - It catches attention by targeting common feelings of fatigue, which can be relatable for many office workers.

3. **I believe the ad is good (4/7):**
   - While it effectively highlights potential consequences without the product, its reliance on fear-mongering feels a bit manipulative to me.

4. **I find the ad attractive (3/7):**
   - The appeal lies in addressing common issues but lacks creativity or genuine emotional resonance given my preference for original ideas and active imagination.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product (2/7):**
   - Despite understanding its benefits, my budget is tight (<15 million VND/month), making it unlikely I'll commit without significant need.
   
2. **Will try to buy the product (1/7):** 
   - Strongly disagree; financial constraints and cautious nature prevent me from actively seeking this purchase.

3. **Will consider buying the product (2/7):**
   - There's a minor consideration if I face persistent fatigue, but overall, other solutions or budget-friendly alternatives would be my priority first.

Overall, while the ad resonates on some levels due to its relatability and direct messaging, personal values around budgeting, emotional stability concerns, and preference for originality lead me to rate it positively yet moderately with limited intent to purchase.
