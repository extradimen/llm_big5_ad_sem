  - **I believe the ad is good:** (Score: 5) Strongly Agree — The message seems positive, but it doesn't excite me enough given my preferences and priorities.

  - **I will try to buy this product:** (Score: 2) Neutral Agree — It might be worth considering for occasional use but not actively pursued.
