**Explanation:**

**Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
- **I like the ad (Score: 4)**: Neutral leaning slightly towards agreement; it's not particularly exciting but seems functional.
- **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 3)**: Slightly disagree. The message feels too straightforward and lacks creativity or novelty to capture my attention.
- **I believe the ad is good (Score: 2)**: Disagree. While I understand its intention, it doesn’t convey a strong enough benefit compelling me personally.
- **I find the ad attractive (Score: 1)**: Strongly disagree. The appeal factor is minimal; it feels too generic and fails to resonate emotionally.

**Purchase Intention:**
- **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)**: Disagree. Although I might understand fatigue, there are other factors affecting my well-being.
- **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)**: Neutral leaning towards slight agreement; it's not a top priority but could be considered under specific conditions.
- **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3)**: Agree. Given its preventive nature, I might evaluate the product if other options don't meet my needs.

Overall, while there is some acknowledgment of the ad’s relevance to fatigue and appearance, it doesn’t strongly compel action due to lackluster presentation and personal preferences. **Purchase intention** leans towards cautious consideration rather than immediate intent.
