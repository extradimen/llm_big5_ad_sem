**Evaluation:**

1. **Ad Attitude**: 
   - *Like the Ad*: While the message is straightforward, it doesn't particularly excite me due to my Strongly Agree tendency towards "generally trusting" and neutral talkativeness but not high sociability.
   - *Interesting*: The ad's focus on fatigue and appearance resonates with common concerns among office workers like myself, making it interesting.
   - *Good Advertisement*: I find the message clear and relevant for maintaining energy and appearance, though some emotional overtones may be excessive given my Strongly Agree "worries a lot" trait.
   - *Attractive Ad*: The visual appeal or presentation might not stand out to me as strongly due to being reserved (Strongly Disagree) but still somewhat neutral.

2. **Purchase Intention**:
   - *Intend to Purchase*: I'm inclined towards cautious consideration rather than immediate purchase intent, influenced by my thorough job attitude (Strongly Disagree).
   - *Try the Product*: Given its relevance and addressing real concerns like fatigue, I might give it a try if available.
   - *Consider Buying*: The product aligns with daily needs for energy and appearance maintenance; therefore, I will definitely keep it in mind when shopping.

Overall, while the ad is effective at capturing my attention by highlighting practical benefits, its attractiveness remains moderate due to personal preferences. Nonetheless, there's a solid intention to consider or even try the product based on functionality rather than emotional appeal.
