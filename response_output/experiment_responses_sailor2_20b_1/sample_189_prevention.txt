**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**  
  1. **I like the ad (Score: 4):** While not strongly positive, I appreciate its straightforward message.
  2. **Interesting (Score: 3):** It’s mildly engaging but doesn't captivate me deeply due to personal preference and relevance.
  3. **Good (Score: 5):** The prevention aspect resonates slightly with my desire for health, though not entirely compelling.
  4. **Attractive (Score: 2):** I find it rather unattractive; the fear of appearing tired isn't a strong motivator.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
  1. **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 1):** No intention due to budget constraints and lack of urgency.
  2. **Will try to buy this product (Score: 2):** Slightly higher than zero, but minimal as my current needs aren't prioritized.
  3. **Will consider buying this product (Score: 3):** Barely considered; while the message is somewhat relevant, it doesn’t outweigh other priorities and financial limitations.

Overall, the ad feels targeted towards younger or more affluent demographics, making it less impactful on someone like me with a modest income and higher practical needs in everyday life. Its focus on appearance isn't as compelling compared to essential health concerns or budget-friendly solutions I can relate to better.
