**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Evaluation:**
   - **Like (4):** Neutral to positive; the ad seems appealing but not overwhelmingly so.
   - **Interesting (5):** Slightly agree; the concept is engaging enough for a busy managerial employee looking for daily boosts.
   - **Good (6):** Agree; it effectively conveys benefits of energy and appearance, which are relevant goals in my lifestyle.
   - **Attractive (4):** Neutral leaning slightly positive; the ad visuals could be more compelling to stand out among other promotional content.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase:** 3 (Neutral). Though it aligns with personal needs, there's no strong immediate impulse due to various product options and budget constraints.
   - **Will try to buy:** 2 (Disagree). Given my preference for tried-and-true products or brands I trust, the ad hasn't convinced me enough yet to make an effort specifically for this one.
   - **Consider buying:** 4 (Neutral leaning Agree). It's definitely on the radar; if it appears in a trusted retailer and offers good value, I'll consider purchasing.

Overall, while thereâ€™s moderate interest due to practical benefits, personal preferences towards thoroughness rather than impulsivity temper my immediate purchase intent. The ad successfully communicates its purpose but could benefit from added credibility or relatability elements to elevate scores further.
