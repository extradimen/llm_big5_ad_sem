**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement (Ad Attitude Scores):**
  - **I like the ad:** *Score: 6*  
    While I appreciate its energy and motivation appeal, it feels somewhat generic without strong personal connection.
  - **I think the ad is interesting:** *Score: 5*
    The idea of staying energized appeals to me, but the execution could be more engaging for a 30-39-year-old Southeast Asian male with my background.
  - **I believe the ad is good:** *Score: 4*  
    While it conveys clear benefits, there's room for better storytelling or personal relevance given my personality traits (e.g., needing social recognition).
  - **I find the ad attractive:** *Score: 3*
    The aesthetic and message are decent, but not enough to stand out strongly. My slightly Agree tendency toward being generally trusting means I'm open to good products, yet this lacks a compelling emotional hook.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to purchase:** *Score: 2*  
    Though the concept resonates somewhat due to my desire for energy and looking good, my current financial constraints (income <15 million VND) make regular purchases less feasible.
  - **Try to buy this product:** *Score: 1.5*   
    My tendency towards thoroughness means I might sample it if offered through a deal or promotion but not with full intent initially due to cost concerns.
  - **Consider buying the product:** *Score: 2*  
    Given my helpful and unselfish nature, I'd consider purchasing it as part of maintaining health and well-being for myself and possibly sharing this good habit with family. However, price remains a significant barrier.

Overall, while there's appreciation for the adâ€™s intent, personal connection, financial feasibility, and immediate relevance need improvement to drive higher purchase intentions. The appeal is moderate but not compelling enough under current circumstances.
