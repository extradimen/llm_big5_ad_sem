**Explanation:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad**: *Score = 2 (Strongly Disagree)*
   - Despite being talkative and outgoing, I find energy drinks somewhat over-marketed for a daily routine boost.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: *Score = 3 (Disagree)*
   - The concept seems common and lacks originality in its messaging, which doesn't captivate my attention.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: *Score = 4 (Neutral)*
   - It's average; it promises benefits but falls short of making a compelling case for someone like me with strong skepticism regarding such claims.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: *Score = 5 (Agree)*
   - The visuals and overall aesthetic are appealing, though not enough to overcome my reservations about the product itself.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: *Score = 1 (Strongly Disagree)*
   - Given that I'm a student with limited income (~25 million VND/month), energy drinks aren't a priority, and personal health benefits are unclear from the ad alone.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: *Score = 1 (Strongly Disagree)* 
   - The perceived cost outweighs any potential short-term gains, especially since there's no urgency or compelling reason to switch my routine.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: *Score = 2 (Disagree)**
   - While the ad is okay aesthetically and energy products have their market, I'm not convinced it aligns with my current lifestyle or financial constraints. It doesn't push me toward making a purchase decision. 

Overall, while somewhat attracted to its presentation, the advertisement fails to resonate strongly enough given my cautious spending habits and general skepticism regarding health-related claims in promotions.
