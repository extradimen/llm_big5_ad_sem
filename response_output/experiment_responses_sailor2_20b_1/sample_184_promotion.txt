**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores**
   - **Like (2):** While the concept of staying energized is appealing, it doesn't strongly resonate with me due to my reserved nature; however, I find enough value in health benefits.
   - **Interesting (3):** Neutral leaning towards positive as energy drinks have become common, but not exceptionally engaging for someone like myself who prefers practicality over flashy ads.
   - **Good (4):** The message of looking good aligns with general self-care values, making it somewhat compelling despite my more reserved outlook on beauty products.
   - **Attractive (3):** Not particularly attractive due to minimal personal connection; still, the promise is reasonable and neutral enough not to turn me off.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores**
   - **Intend (3):** I don’t feel a strong drive but acknowledge its potential benefits for energy.
   - **Try (3):** Willing to give it a try if available in local stores, as my unselfish helpfulness extends to experimenting with solutions that could improve daily life.
   - **Consider (5):** Considering the product's reliability and price within my budget is crucial. The ad’s credibility and alignment with practical needs make me inclined towards consideration.

Overall, while I don't find the advertisement overwhelmingly persuasive or attractive due to personal temperament, its functional benefits and trustworthy presentation encourage a moderate level of interest and contemplation for potential purchase.
