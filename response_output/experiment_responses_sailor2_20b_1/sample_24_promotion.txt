**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**  
  - *I like the ad.* – **2**: The advertisement is more aligned with sociable themes but feels superficial given my reserved nature and lack of emotional stability.
  - *Interesting* – **3**: It piques mild interest due to energy claims, but does not engage deeply because I lean towards practicality over hype.
  - *Believe it's good.* – **4**: Neutral belief; the promise is standard for many products, lacking strong credibility or personal relevance.
  - *Attractive* – **3**: Visually and conceptually, marginally attractive due to universal benefits but not compelling enough considering my reserved nature.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
  - *Intend*: **1 (Strongly Disagree)**. The ad doesn't resonate deeply with my values or daily needs.
  - *Try*: **2 (Disagree)**. I'm skeptical about the product's effectiveness without further evidence, given past experiences with similar claims.
  - *Consider*: **3 (Neutral)**. While not strongly inclined to buy now, it might be worth trying if there are specific assurances or discounts that align better with my cautious mindset.

Overall, while somewhat interested due to basic utility, the ad falls short in motivating an immediate purchase based on my personality and consumer behaviors.
