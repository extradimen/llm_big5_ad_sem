**Evaluation and Justification:**
1. **Like the Ad (Neutral - Score 4):** While I appreciate its message of staying energized, my focus on studies makes it less appealing.
2. **Interesting (Disagree - Score 3):** As a high school student living with parents, everyday tasks are more central than novelty beverages.
3. **Good (Agree - Score 5):** Recognize the benefits for energy and appearance but not urgent needs in my current phase of life.
4. **Attractive (Disagree - Score 3):** Lacks relevance compared to other priorities like academics, social responsibilities with family.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **Intend to Purchase:** Low intent (Score 2) due to limited immediate need and focus on studies.
2. **Try to Buy:** Unlikely (Score 2) as I prioritize essential purchases over promotional items without compelling urgency.
3. **Consider Buying:** Moderate consideration (Score 4), reserved for extreme conditions like intense stress or energy dips affecting performance.

Overall, while acknowledging the drink's potential benefits, my practical situation and priorities lead me to a neutral-to-negative ad attitude with moderate purchase intent under exceptional circumstances.
