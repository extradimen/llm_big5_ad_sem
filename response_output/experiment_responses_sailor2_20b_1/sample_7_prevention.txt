}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the advertisement:**
  - **I like the ad (Score: 4):** Neutral-leaning positive; it acknowledges my concern about fatigue and appearance.
  - **Interesting (Score: 5):** Agreeable since health concerns are relatable, making the message intriguing.
  - **Believe is good (Score: 3):** Neutral—while informative, lacks compelling evidence or emotional resonance to strongly agree.
  - **Attractive (Score: 2):** Disagree; despite addressing tiredness and dull appearance, its straightforward approach doesn't captivate me.

- **Purchase intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase (Score: 1):** Strongly disagree; the ad isn’t persuasive enough given my tendency toward careful decision-making.
  - **Will try to buy (Score: 2):** Disagree; though health-conscious, I'm cautious and need more compelling reasons or proof before trying a new product.
  - **Consider buying (Score: 3):** Neutral; the concern is valid but not sufficient for immediate action without further research.

Overall, while acknowledging its relevance to common issues like fatigue and appearance, the advertisement falls short in engaging my trusting yet cautious nature. Hence, I'm inclined toward neutral-to-negative scores. Further details or a more persuasive narrative would be needed to sway me towards higher purchase intention.
