**Evaluation and Rationale:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
  - **Like:** Neutral (4) – While I appreciate energetic drinks, my overall engagement isn't strong.
  - **Interesting:** Agree (5) – The promise of energy and looking good daily does spark some interest.
  - **Good:** Slightly Agree (3) – It’s a decent ad with clear benefits but lacks the emotional connection needed for high enthusiasm.
  - **Attractive:** Neutral (4) – Generally, it looks okay but doesn’t stand out significantly to me.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to Purchase:** Disagree (2) – While I acknowledge its appeal, my current financial constraints and lack of immediate need make a purchase unlikely.
  - **Try to Buy:** Strongly Disagree (1) – Given the limited budget (<15 million VND), trying this product is not viable at present.
  - **Consider Buying:** Disagree (2) – I might revisit it in future circumstances when energy boosters become more of a priority, but for now, considerations are low.

Overall, while finding parts of the ad interesting and potentially useful, my financial situation and lack of urgency outweigh the positive aspects. Therefore, the intention to buy is minimal despite some appreciative attitudes towards its messaging.
