**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**  
  - **Like (Score = 5):** Given my talkative nature and strong sociability, I find energetic drinks appealing for social settings. The promise of looking good enhances its attractiveness slightly.
  - **Interesting (Score = 4):** While the concept is not revolutionary, it taps into common needs for daily energy and appearance enhancement, making it moderately interesting.
  - **Good (Score = 3):** I'm Neutral on being helpful but skeptical about claims without specific evidence. It lacks compelling details to consider it excellent.
  - **Attractive (Score = 2):** My reserved side leans towards more straightforward messaging; the ad's glossy tone feels somewhat manipulative.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend (Score = 1):** Despite my sociable traits, I am not convinced due to budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND) and a lack of trust in quick-fix promises.
  - **Try (Score = 1):** Given the neutral-to-negative attitude towards energy drinks and limited disposable income, trying it seems unlikely without more compelling offers or proof.
  - **Consider (Score = 1):** Considering purchasing is low; my cautious nature makes me lean toward more tested alternatives with better value.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad's appeal to social and energetic needs, its lack of credibility and practical relevance in my current lifestyle lead to a negative purchase intention score.
