**Explanation:**

**Ad Attitudes:**
- **I like the ad (2/7):** As someone who is reserved and not particularly talkative, I find such an assertive claim a bit overbearing.
- **Interesting (3/7):** It has some relevance to staying energetic but doesn't stand out as exceptionally intriguing for me personally.
- **Believe it's good (4/7):** While neutral on the overall appeal, there is some credibility in highlighting fatigue and appearance issues that resonate with daily experiences.
- **Attractive (1/7):** Given my reserved nature and tendency towards careful planning, this ad feels somewhat manipulative rather than attractive.

**Purchase Intention:**
- **Intend to purchase (2/7):** I'm not immediately inclined due to skepticism about such strong claims without further evidence or personal need.
- **Will try to buy (2/7):** A bit of curiosity might push me towards a trial, but no urgent action is taken.
- **Consider buying (3/7):** Despite my tendency toward originality and problem-solving, the low attraction score means I'll keep it in mind for future consideration rather than immediate purchase. 

Overall, while there's recognition that fatigue impacts appearance, the ad lacks the persuasive touch to compel a quick decision from someone with these personality traits and values.
