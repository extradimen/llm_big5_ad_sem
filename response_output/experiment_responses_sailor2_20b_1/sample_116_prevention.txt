**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
- **Like (Score: 3)**: The ad doesn't strongly appeal to me. My reserved nature and neutral feelings about being helpful make it mildly agreeable but not compelling.
- **Interesting (Score: 4)**: It's somewhat intriguing, especially for those who might feel fatigued or need a boost of energy, which is relevant in my daily life as a civil servant.
- **Good (Score: 5)**: I find the message decently conveyed; it doesn't outright persuade me but acknowledges potential benefits that align with staying alert and presentable at work.
- **Attractive (Score: 2)**: The appeal isn’t strong. Being neither outgoing nor talkative, my personal preferences lean towards subtler marketing approaches.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend to purchase (Score: 1)**: Given my budget constraints (<15 million VND/month), I'm unlikely to commit without a stronger motivation or discount.
- **Try to buy (Score: 2)**: There's mild curiosity, but the ad alone isn’t enough. Practicality and necessity would need reinforcement.
- **Consider buying (Score: 3)**: Open-minded about evaluating it further if offered at an affordable price point; my creative originality might prompt trying something new for a potential solution to fatigue.

In summary, while I'm not dismissive of the ad's message, its attractiveness falls short due to personal preferences and financial considerations. A more targeted approach or additional incentives could improve purchase intentions.
