**Evaluation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - I like the ad (Score: **3**: Disagree): Although it aims to promote energy and appearance, my reserved nature makes me less inclined to find such ads compelling.
  - I think the ad is interesting (Score: **4**: Neutral): The message of staying energized can be engaging, but not enough to spark strong interest given my personality traits.
  - I believe the ad is good (Score: **5**: Agree): It conveys clear benefits, which aligns with a basic value for usefulness in daily life. However, it doesn't strongly resonate emotionally or socially.
  - I find the ad attractive (Score: **2**: Strongly Disagree): Due to my tendency towards being unselfish and less outgoing, aesthetics and appearance-focused ads do not attract me personally.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - I intend to purchase this product (Score: **1**: Strongly Disagree): My monthly income is tight within the range of 16,000,000â€“25,000,000 VND, and given my budget constraints coupled with a lack of immediate need or strong emotional connection, I don't intend to buy this product.
  - I will try to buy this product (Score: **3**: Neutral): If it were significantly discounted during a sale period, there might be a mild interest in trying the product once. However, regular purchase is unlikely due to cost and personal priorities.
  - I will consider buying this product (Score: **2**: Disagree): While acknowledging its potential benefits, other more necessary expenses take precedence, so active consideration remains low.

In summary, while understanding the ad's positive message and finding some aspects agreeable, my reserved nature, budget concerns, and practical needs overshadow any significant attraction or intention to purchase. Hence, a cautious but critical evaluation results in generally lower scores for both attitude and purchase intent.
