**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **I like the ad:** Disagree (2) — The direct claim about feeling tired and dull might not resonate deeply as it does feel a bit over-the-top.
  - **Interesting:** Agree (4) — It sparks curiosity about preventing fatigue, which is relatable for someone working hard daily.
  - **Good Ad:** Neutral (3) — While the message seems straightforward, its execution lacks creativity or emotional connection.
  - **Attractive:** Strongly Disagree (1) — The ad’s presentation might come off as manipulative and not compelling enough.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to purchase:** Not strongly committed (2) — Despite the message's relevance, there isn’t a strong personal drive.
  - **Try to buy:** Neutral with slight inclination (3) — The product might be given a try due to work-related fatigue but not without hesitation.
  - **Consider buying:** Somewhat likely (5) — It remains on my radar for future consideration if the benefits are validated by others or experiences.

Overall, while acknowledging its relevance, there's room for improvement in engaging and persuasive elements of the ad. The practical implications align with a cautious yet open approach to potential purchase.
