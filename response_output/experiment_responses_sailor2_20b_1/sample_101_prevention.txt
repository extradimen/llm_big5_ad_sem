**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad:** (2): Although it targets a common issue of fatigue and appearance, its straightforward messaging feels somewhat manipulative.
- **I think the ad is interesting:** (3): It doesn't captivate me; I find it too generic for an effective appeal.
- **I believe the ad is good:** (4): The concept has potential but lacks creativity or emotional connection to make a strong impact on someone like me.
- **I find the ad attractive:** (1): The presentation isnâ€™t appealing, and its simplicity doesn't align with my interests.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product:** (2): While tiredness is relevant, I'm not convinced by the ad alone. Other factors would need consideration.
- **I will try to buy this product:** (3): Mild curiosity might lead me to give it a trial if recommended elsewhere or during sales.
- **I will consider buying this product:** (2): Although skeptical about its effectiveness based on the ad, external endorsements could sway my decision.

In summary, while I recognize the ad addresses real concerns, its execution fails to resonate with my personality and preferences. This leads to moderate intent but high caution towards purchasing without additional reassurance.
