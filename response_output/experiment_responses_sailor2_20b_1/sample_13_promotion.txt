**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
    - **Like (5)**: The energetic promise appeals but it doesn't strongly resonate given my personality and current situation.
    - **Interesting (4)**: Slightly interesting due to its claims, especially helpful for a blue-collar worker's busy life.
    - **Good (6)**: Fairly good; the benefits align with wanting energy and appearance improvement, though not perfect fit.
    - **Attractive (3)**: Not very attractive as it feels overly promotional without tangible proof of effectiveness.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to Purchase (2)**: Low intent because my current financial constraints (monthly income) are tight, and I need more assurance on the product's value.
   - **Try to Buy (2)**: Unlikely immediate trial due to lack of urgent necessity or strong emotional connection.
   - **Consider Buying (3)**: Might consider it if thereâ€™s a good deal, credible endorsements, or specific personal needs align with its promises.

In summary, I appreciate the ad's messaging but need more compelling evidence and alignment with my budget constraints for serious consideration.
