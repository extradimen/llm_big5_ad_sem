**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
   - *I like the ad.* (2/7): Although it's not strongly engaging, its positive message resonates mildly.
   - *Interesting* (3/7): The concept is straightforward but lacks something novel to capture my attention fully.
   - *Good* (4/7): It presents an appealing benefit for energy and appearance; the idea seems credible enough without being groundbreaking.
   - *Attractive* (3.5/7): Generally attractive, though not compelling enough given personal preferences and lifestyle.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - *Intend to purchase.* (1/7): Strongly disagree—there are other more budget-friendly options available that meet my needs adequately.
   - *Will try to buy* (2/7): Disagree—I am hesitant due to current alternatives and the cost.
   - *Consider buying* (4/7): Neutral-leaning towards agree. While not a priority, it could be considered if there's a good promotion or need arises.

**Summary:**  
The ad appeals mildly but doesn't ignite strong interest due to my reserved nature, budget constraints as a civil servant, and existing alternatives for energy drinks. Though the benefits are acknowledged, they don’t drive immediate purchasing behavior; I remain open but cautious in considering it.
