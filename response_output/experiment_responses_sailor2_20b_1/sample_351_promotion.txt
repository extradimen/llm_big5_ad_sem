**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Ad Attitude:
- **Like (Score: 2)**: While the ad presents an attractive promise of energy and looking good daily, it feels generic rather than personally compelling for me. The message doesn't resonate deeply with my specific needs or lifestyle.
  
- **Interesting (Score: 3)**: It is somewhat interesting due to its focus on everyday benefits, but lacks unique selling points that would really capture attention.

- **Good (Score: 4)**: I believe the ad's intent is clear and well-presented. However, it doesn't inspire strong engagement or emotional connection given my personality traits like being emotionally stable yet sometimes careless.

- **Attractive (Score: 1)**: Given my neutral to negative views on its uniqueness and personal relevance, the overall attractiveness falls short for me.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend (Score: 1)**: While I appreciate staying energized and looking good, there are too many alternatives in a saturated market. Without a compelling reason or strong emotional connection, intent is very low.
  
- **Try (Score: 1)**: The lack of special incentive or personalized appeal reduces my willingness to try the product.

- **Consider (Score: 2)**: I might consider it if given a chance through sample offers or discounted trials. My neutral stance on helpfulness means practicality still leaves room for consideration, but not strong intent.

Overall, while acknowledging its positive intentions and general effectiveness, the ad fails to ignite personal interest or urgency due to my preferences and current context (studying, living with parents). Thus, a balanced yet critical evaluation results in moderate to low scores.
