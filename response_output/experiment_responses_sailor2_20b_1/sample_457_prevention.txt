### Evaluation Breakdown:

**Ad Attitude:**
1. **Like the Ad (Score: 3)** - While not strongly attracted, the ad does convey a need to avoid tiredness and dull appearance which resonates slightly.
2. **Interesting (Score: 4)** - The message is clear but doesn't evoke strong curiosity or excitement.
3. **Good Advertisement (Score: 5)** - It's decently made with persuasive messaging targeting common concerns, though not exceptionally well-executed.
4. **Attractive (Score: 2)** - The appeal is minimal; my reserved nature means I don’t find it particularly compelling.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **Intend to Purchase**: Given my budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND/month), a strong intent isn't there.
2. **Try to Buy**: If occasional tiredness becomes problematic or within financial reach, I’ll give it a try.
3. **Consider Buying**: Health and appearance are important; hence, if the product aligns with my needs without breaking the bank, I will seriously consider making the purchase.

Overall, while there's some positive acknowledgment of the ad’s effectiveness in addressing common issues, actual purchasing intent is influenced by financial limitations and cautious decision-making style.
