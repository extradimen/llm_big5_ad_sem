**Evaluation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  
   - **Like (Score=4):** The ad seems decent but lacks a personal connection. As someone who values social interaction and conversation (Strongly Agree), I find it somewhat engaging yet not compelling.
   - **Interesting (Score=5):** It piques my curiosity about energy boosts, especially relevant for maintaining daily vigor. However, it doesn't stand out uniquely compared to similar ads.
   - **Good (Score=6):** The message aligns with staying energized and looking good—practical benefits resonate well with a working lifestyle but could be more compellingly presented.
   - **Attractive (Score=3):** While not unattractive, the ad feels generic. My preference for being reserved means I need more distinctive visuals or personal relevance to find it genuinely attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
   - **Intend (Score=2):** Despite understanding its benefits, my current budget and prioritization lean towards necessities over indulgences.
   - **Try (Score=1):** Given that the product could help with energy levels, trying might be worth it in theory but not a strong immediate urge due to cost considerations.
   - **Consider (Score=3):** I would definitely keep an open mind and evaluate further if circumstances change or promotions arise. The potential value is there, just not immediately actionable.

Overall, the ad resonates moderately with my values and lifestyle needs; it’s informative but lacks the punch needed for a strong purchase intent given my current priorities and financial situation.
