**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - *I like the ad.* (Score: 2) - As a reserved individual, I find ads that are too energetic or flashy unappealing.
   - *Interesting.* (Score: 3) - The promise of energy and looking good is appealing but not highly engaging for my personality.
   - *Believe it's good.* (Score: 4) - Neutral to slightly agree; the claims seem reasonable, but I'm cautious about credibility.
   - *Attractive.* (Score: 3) - Generally find it okay, though not particularly attractive given my reserved nature.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend to purchase this product.* (Score: 1) - Strongly disagree; my budget constraints and current reliance on simpler alternatives prevent a strong intent.
   - *Will try to buy this product.* (Score: 1) - Agree with strongly disagree; the cost is likely out of reach for now.
   - *Consider buying it.* (Score: 2) - Neutral-to-Disagree, but I acknowledge its potential benefits and might reconsider under specific circumstances or budget improvements.

Overall, while acknowledging the product's purported advantages, my reserved nature and financial limitations lead to a low likelihood of immediate purchase. The ad is acceptable rather than compelling for me.
