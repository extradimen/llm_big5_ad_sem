**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Ad Attitudes**
   - **I like the ad**: (Score = 4) Neutral with slight positive leaning—While I appreciate clear messaging about benefits, its simplicity might not fully captivate me.
   - **Interesting**: (Score = 3) Neutral but slightly agreeable—the claim is straightforward and directly relevant to a common concern (fatigue), making it moderately interesting.
   - **Good**: (Score = 2) Disagree—While the message is clear, there's room for more compelling evidence or creative execution. The ad feels somewhat generic.
   - **Attractive**: (Score = 3) Neutral with positive tilt—the visual appeal and urgency of avoiding fatigue could attract me if presented better.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to purchase this product** (Score = 5): Agree—I recognize the need for energy drinks, but additional factors like brand reputation and personal habits would influence my immediate decision.
   - **Will try to buy this product** (Score = 6): Strongly Agree—Since it addresses fatigue effectively, I'm likely to give it a chance with proper marketing or recommendations from trusted sources.
   - **Will consider buying this product** (Score = 7): Strongly Agree—I see its value in maintaining energy levels. Though not an automatic buy, the potential benefits make me seriously contemplate purchasing.

In summary:
- The ad effectively communicates urgency and benefit but could be more engaging to fully win my favor.
- My purchase intention is high due to personal relevance and understanding of fatigue issues, yet other factors will also play a role in final decision-making.
