**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (Score: 5)**: I find the general concept appealing since staying energized is crucial for a blue-collar worker's routine.
   - **Interesting (Score: 4)**: It peaks curiosity, especially around how it claims to make me look better daily, but some skepticism remains due to common marketing language.
   - **Good (Score: 6)**: On the surface, the message aligns with wellness trends and is well-presented. However, I need more credible evidence of its effectiveness.
   - **Attractive (Score: 3)**: While not unattractive, it’s a bit overhyped for my tastes; the visual appeal could be stronger to genuinely capture attention.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend (Score: 2)**: I don't strongly intend to buy now because there's insufficient trust built from this ad alone.
   - **Try (Score: 3)**: Given my generally agreeable nature and the product’s promise, I might consider a small purchase trial if it offers a sample pack or discounts. 
   - **Consider (Score: 4)**: The idea resonates enough to keep me thinking about trying it at some point, but more reviews/testimonials would boost consideration significantly.

Overall, while the ad piques interest and aligns somewhat with my values, additional trust-building steps are necessary for a firm purchase decision. Practical evidence of efficacy alongside an attractive deal could tip the balance towards higher scores and stronger intentions.
