**Evaluation Details:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (score: 6)** - As a talkative and outgoing person who values feeling energized, I find it appealing that the drink promises energy. However, my strong tendency to worry makes me cautious about such claims.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (score: 5)** - It does capture attention with its focus on daily appearance enhancement, aligning somewhat with personal desires for maintaining a good look and feeling better.
3. **I believe the ad is good (score: 4)** - While I appreciate the idea of staying energized, there's some skepticism about the credibility given my financial constraints and need for reliable results rather than just marketing promises.
4. **I find the ad attractive (score: 3)** - Although it appeals to sociability and wanting a boost in daily life, its attractiveness is somewhat diluted by concerns over cost-efficiency.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (score: 2)** - Despite being strongly agreeable towards helpfulness and thorough work, I am hesitant due to my limited monthly income (<15,000,000 VND), making high-priced energy drinks less feasible.
2. **I will try to buy this product (score: 3)** - While curiosity is there, the cost might prevent an immediate purchase; however, positive word-of-mouth could sway me later.
3. **I will consider buying this product (score: 4)** - I acknowledge its potential benefits and keep it in mind for future opportunities or when finances permit a more considered investment.

In summary, though initially appealing due to sociability and energy needs, practical considerations like affordability lead to moderate skepticism regarding immediate purchase intent but leave room for reconsideration. The ad strikes a balance of attractiveness with cautious optimism from someone with my background.
