   - *Interesting*: Agree (4) – The promise of staying energized is relevant and interesting to me as an office worker.
   - *Good*: Strongly Agree (5) – It conveys clear benefits that are valued in daily life, appealing to both work productivity and personal well-being.
   - *Attractive*: Strongly Agree (6) – The message is visually attractive and aspirational, resonating with maintaining a good appearance.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend*: Neutral towards strong intention (2/3). Though I appreciate the ad, current budget considerations might prevent immediate purchase.
   - *Try to Buy*: Agree (4) – It’s compelling enough for me to consider giving it a try if circumstances align later on.

Balancing my practical nature with a desire for maintaining energy and appearance, this advertisement holds significant potential but requires further alignment with personal budgeting. Thus, while I highly appreciate it, immediate purchase is not guaranteed, making scores moderate to strong rather than purely high.
