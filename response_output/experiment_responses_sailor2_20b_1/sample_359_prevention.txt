**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitudes:**
   - **Like the Ad (Score: 3)**: Neutral to slightly positive. The ad's message is relatable but doesn't strongly excite me.
   - **Interesting (Score: 4)**: Agreeably interesting; it captures a common concern about energy and appearance.
   - **Good (Score: 2)**: Disagree, as the claim feels generic rather than well-articulated or unique in its approach.
   - **Attractive (Score: 5)**: Moderate attraction due to an effective message of prevention for tiredness and dull looks.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase (Score: 4)**: Neutral leaning towards agreement; the ad resonates enough to consider it, but not decisively.
   - **Try to Buy (Score: 4)**: Similar consideration level—willing to give it a trial given its relevance.
   - **Consider Buying (Score: 6)**: Strongly agree. The product’s benefits align with personal needs, making me seriously consider purchasing despite reservations about the ad itself.

Overall, while not entirely enamored by the advertisement's execution, my practical concerns and proactive nature make me open to trying the product for its promised improvements in energy and appearance.
