**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**: 
   - While it doesn't perfectly align with my reserved and cautious nature (Strongly Agree), there are elements of social appeal ("look your best") which interest me. The ad is decent but not overwhelmingly compelling, hence scores around middle to slightly positive.
   
- **Purchase Intention**:
   - Despite finding the idea acceptable, I prioritize practicality and thoroughness over a quick fix ("do a thorough job: Strongly Disagree"). Given my high income (46M VND) and stable financial standing, considering it doesn't directly align with core values or urgency needs, my intent to purchase is low.
   
Overall, while the ad isnâ€™t offensive or irrelevant, its promises aren't enough to sway me towards an immediate or strong buying decision. Hence, moderate scores reflect balanced but cautious consideration.
