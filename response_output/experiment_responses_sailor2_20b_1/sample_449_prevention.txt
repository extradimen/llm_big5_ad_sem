**Evaluation and Rationale:**

1. **Ad Attitude (Scores):**
   - **I like the ad:** Agree with a score of **4**: The direct message about avoiding tiredness and dull appearance resonates moderately but not strongly.
   - **Interesting:** Neutral leaning slightly positive, scored as **3**: It's straightforward and doesn't hold my attention completely due to its simplicity.
   - **Believe it’s good:** Slightly below average at **2**: While the ad seems credible, I don’t find it compelling enough to wholly trust its claims without further information.
   - **Attractive:** A score of **5** (Neutral leaning positive): The visual and emotional appeal is sufficient but not overwhelmingly engaging.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase:** Scored as **3**: My strong tendency towards making plans (Strongly Agree) leads me to consider the product, but my casual approach (Strongly Agree on being careless) doesn’t drive immediate intent.
   - **Will try to buy:** Score of **2**: Although I value efficiency in some aspects and enjoy trying new things occasionally, there’s not enough urgency or excitement here for a strong purchase attempt.
   - **Consider buying:** A score of **3** again: The ad prompts me to think about the product but doesn’t push me over into a serious consideration phase. Given my lifestyle balance between responsibilities (civil servant) and personal indulgences, it lands on cautious contemplation.

Overall, while I appreciate the directness of the message and its relevance in maintaining vitality, the advertising effort isn't enough to spur an immediate or strong purchasing decision due to a balanced mix of skepticism, practicality, and moderate openness.
