**Evaluation and Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
  - **I like the ad (Score = 4):** While not strongly disagreeing or hating it, I find some aspects of the drink's promise appealing to combat tiredness. However, neutral-to-moderately favorable.
  - **Interesting (Score = 5):** The ad is moderately interesting due to its direct messaging but lacks a compelling hook for me personally.
  - **Good (Score = 3):** Neutral leaning towards slightly positive; it effectively communicates the problem and solution but feels generic without strong credibility or unique value propositions.
  - **Attractive (Score = 2):** Low attractiveness—lacking emotional connection, creativity, or genuine trust in its claims.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase (Score = 1):** Strongly disagree; despite understanding the need for energy boosts, there are many alternatives and this ad doesn't create a strong enough desire.
  - **Try to buy (Score = 1):** Equally low—no compelling reason or personal fit justifies making an effort to try this product over others I know.
  - **Consider buying (Score = 2):** Slightly better, but still unlikely. While it addresses a universal concern, the ad doesn't resonate deeply enough for serious consideration.

Overall, while acknowledging the practical issue of tiredness and dull appearance addressed, my emotionally stable nature combined with strong skepticism towards generic health claims leads me to find the advertisement moderately effective at best yet unconvincing in driving purchase behavior.
