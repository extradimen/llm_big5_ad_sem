**Explanation:**

### **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
1. **Like (score = 3)**:
   - As someone who is *Strongly Agree* talkative and generally prefers engagement but doesn't see myself as outgoing or attractive to such marketing (Disagree on being sociable), I find it mildly appealing.
2. **Interesting (score = 4)**:
   - The promise of staying energized resonates with my active lifestyle, making the ad somewhat engaging.
3. **Good (score = 5)**:
   - While not strongly convincing, it feels well-meaning and has elements of positivity which I appreciate; however, itâ€™s neither exceptional nor revolutionary for me.
4. **Attractive (score = 6)**:
   - The emphasis on looking good daily aligns with a shared sense of wanting to feel confident, making the ad more appealing.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **Intend to Purchase (score = 2)**:
   - Despite liking parts of it, my income constraints (<15,000,000 VND) and priorities toward necessities make a strong purchase intention unlikely.
2. **Try to Buy (score = 2)**:
   - Neutral disposition; might consider sampling if available at affordable prices or through promotions but not an immediate priority.
3. **Consider Buying (score = 3)**:
   - I'm open to considering this product, especially given its benefits of energy and appearance improvement, provided it fits within my budget considerations.

Overall, while the ad garners positive reactions on several fronts due to personal values like helpfulness and emotional stability, practical concerns such as affordability limit a strong purchase commitment. The balance is thus moderate interest with cautious consideration for potential use.
