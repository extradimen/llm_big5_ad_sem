**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitudes (Scores):**
   - **I like the ad:** Score = 3
     - Given my reserved nature and tendency to be unselfish but not strongly talkative, I appreciate straightforward messages without being overly enthusiastic.
   - **Interesting:** Score = 4
     - It provides a clear issue (feeling tired and looking dull), making it relevant and mildly engaging for someone with daily concerns about energy levels and appearance.
   - **Good Ad:** Score = 5 
     - While not exceptional, the ad effectively highlights potential problems without being overbearing or patronizing.
   - **Attractive:** Score = 2
     - My reserved personality leans towards ads that are less attention-grabbing; this one is neutral to slightly unappealing in terms of appeal.

2. **Purchase Intention (Scores):**
   - **Intend to purchase:** Score = 4 
     - The message resonates, but I'm not compelled enough to immediately buy.
   - **Will try to buy:** Score = 4
     - There's mild curiosity about potential benefits, prompting a consideration period before making a decision.
   - **Consider buying:** Score = 6
     - Given my emotional stability and tendency to make plans (Agree), I am open to evaluating the product further as it aligns with maintaining energy levels.

Overall, while the ad is effective in raising awareness of fatigue-related issues, its direct yet reserved nature leaves room for cautious consideration rather than immediate action. The balanced scores reflect a pragmatic approach influenced by my background and personality traits.
