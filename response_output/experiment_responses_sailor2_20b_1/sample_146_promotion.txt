**Explanation:**

### **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
- **I like the ad (4/7):** While I appreciate its positive messaging about energy and appearance, my strong talkativeness doesn't necessarily align with feeling strongly enthusiastic about it.
  
- **Interesting (5/7):** The concept is intriguing, but being somewhat reserved makes me less excited compared to more outgoing individuals.

- **Believe the ad is good (6/7):** Given my trust and helpful nature, I generally think the message can be beneficial for daily life. However, it doesn't spark overwhelming belief or excitement.
  
- **Attractive (3/7):** The visual appeal isnâ€™t compelling enough to draw me in strongly; personal focus on thoroughness over aesthetics means this aspect is somewhat lacking.

### **Purchase Intention**
- **Intend to purchase (2/7):** Despite the persuasive message, my current financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND) and cautious spending habits mean it's unlikely I'd commit immediately.
  
- **Will try to buy (1.5/7):** A slightly higher interest than intent but still low due to budget limitations and a tendency towards practicality over impulse buying.

- **Consider buying (3/7):** Open to considering in the future if there are discounts or financial adjustments, balancing my desire for wellness with affordability concerns.

In summary, while I find aspects of the ad appealing, personal priorities and current lifestyle factors lead to moderate interest without immediate purchase intent.
