- **Interesting**: Agree (Score of 4) - The promise of energy and looking good is intriguing for daily life.
- **Believe the ad is good**: Agree (Score of 5) - Health-consciousness resonates with my values, though I need more proof.
- **Attractive**: Neutral-leaning negative (Score of 3) - Lack strong personal connection; needs to be more engaging.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend to purchase this product**: Strongly Disagree (Score of 2) - While the benefits are enticing, current budget constraints and skepticism about its effectiveness.
- **Will try to buy this product**: Strongly Disagree (Score of 1) - No immediate need or urgency to spend extra money on it right now.
