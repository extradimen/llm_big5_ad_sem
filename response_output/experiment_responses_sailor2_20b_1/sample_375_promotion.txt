**Evaluation:**
- **Attitude Toward Advertisement:** 
   - I have a modest liking for the ad due to its straightforward message about energy and appearance, aligning somewhat with my desire for practical products. It's interesting but not highly engaging given my reserved nature.
   - The claim of being "energized" resonates slightly, though it feels more like an everyday expectation rather than something groundbreaking.
   - I believe the ad is good since its core message is clear and useful to maintain daily performance.
   - Attractiveness is moderate; while functional benefits are appealing, my personal style leans towards simple, reliable products over flashy ads.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - While I don't strongly intend (5), I am inclined due to the practicality for maintaining energy levels and appearance, crucial aspects of daily life.
   - Trying it out seems reasonable; this fits with my tendency to follow through on plans once committed.
   - Considering the purchase is a balanced approach given the moderate appeal, aligning well within my financial range (36-45 million VND/month), but I'd weigh practical benefits over immediate emotional excitement.

Overall, while not extremely compelling as an ad, it holds potential utility for me and falls into considerate buying behavior based on its functional promises.
