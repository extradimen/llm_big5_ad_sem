**Evaluation Explanation:**

### **Ad Attitude Scores:**
- **Like (Score: 3)**: Despite being talkative and outgoing in some contexts, the ad's promise of energy and looks doesn't strongly resonate with my personal priorities.
  
- **Interesting (Score: 4)**: The idea of staying energized is appealing; however, it lacks a unique or compelling hook that would make me feel truly excited.

- **Good (Score: 2)**: While the premise seems positive, I have concerns about credibility and relevance given my current lifestyle as a blue-collar worker with limited disposable income. 

- **Attractive (Score: 3)**: The ad is moderately attractive but doesn't capture enough of my attention to stand out impressively.

### **Purchase Intention Scores:**
- **Intend to Purchase**: *1* - Given my budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND/month) and priority on essential needs over indulgences, I am unlikely to prioritize this product.
  
- **Try to Buy**: *2* - Although open-minded, the high price point and competing financial obligations make it less likely for me to actively seek out this item.

- **Consider Buying**: *3* - There's a small chance of considering it during sales or when my situation improves. It has minimal impact on immediate purchasing decisions but keeps an option open in the future.

Overall, while I find aspects appealing, practical considerations and current priorities lead to low-to-moderate scores for both ad attitude and purchase intention.
