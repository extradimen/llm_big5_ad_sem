**Evaluation Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
   - **I like the ad (score=3)**: Neutral leaning towards Disagree. As a civil servant with strong work ethics but high stress levels and emotional instability, I find it somewhat engaging yet not particularly appealing.
   - **Interesting (score=2)**: Strongly Disagree. The message is straightforward without much creativity or novelty that would capture my attention beyond its basic claim.
   - **Good (score=4)**: Agree. While the ad seems to convey a clear benefit, it's not compelling enough given my reserved and sometimes anxious nature.
   - **Attractive (score=1)**: Strongly Disagree. It lacks elements of trust or emotional appeal that resonate with my generally trusting but high-worry personality.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase (score=2)**: Strongly Disagree. Despite recognizing the potential benefit, personal preferences and current circumstances make me hesitant.
   - **Will try to buy (score=3)**: Neutral leaning towards Agree. There's a mild curiosity due to my tendency for thoroughness but it doesn't push me strongly enough to act.
   - **Consider buying (score=4)**: Slightly Agree. I might keep an open mind, acknowledging the possibility of using it during times when energy levels are critical, though not actively seeking out this product yet.

In summary, while understanding its preventive message and acknowledging potential value, my balanced outlook with high stress sensitivity leads to moderate interest but low immediate purchase intention. The ad needs more compelling personal connection or emotional reassurance for me to seriously consider buying the product.
