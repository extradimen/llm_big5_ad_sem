**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (3/7):**
   - Neutral to slightly positive; while it's effective in conveying a sense of urgency, its simplicity can be underwhelming given my outgoing nature.

2. **I think the ad is interesting (4/7):**
   - Agree: The message about feeling tired and looking dull piques mild interest due to relatable daily experiences but lacks novelty for someone with high sociability levels like mine.

3. **I believe the ad is good (5/7):** 
   - Slightly agree: It effectively highlights a common problem, making it credible. However, its straightforwardness doesn't fully captivate my attention or emotionally engage me deeply.

4. **I find the ad attractive (2/7):**
   - Disagree: The visual and emotional appeal is minimal; I seek more dynamic content to align with my outgoing personality and active social life.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (2/7):**
   - Neutral leaning negative: Though the message resonates slightly, there isn’t enough compelling reason or brand engagement driving an immediate purchase decision.

2. **I will try to buy this product (2/7):**
   - Similar score as intent; I might give it a chance if recommended by friends but not driven solely by the ad's appeal.

3. **I will consider buying this product (3/7):**
   - Slightly agree: It falls into consideration territory, especially considering practical benefits like energy levels. However, other priorities and competing options may take precedence without strong external influence or personal need reinforcement from friends or experiences. 

Overall, the ad is functional but doesn't fully align with my outgoing personality, high social engagement, and preference for engaging content—resulting in moderate interest and a guarded purchase intention.
