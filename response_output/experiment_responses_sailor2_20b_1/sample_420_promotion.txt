**Evaluation and Rationale:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad:** (Score: 2)
   - Given my tendency to be reserved and sometimes rude but helpful with others, I find it difficult to emotionally connect or "like" overly energetic marketing.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score: 3)
   - Neutral personality trait means I'm open to it being mildly interesting but not gripping enough due to personal preferences for more down-to-earth messages.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score: 4)
   - On a neutral-positive side, the promise of staying energized and looking best appeals slightly; however, trust issues make me cautious about its effectiveness claims.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score: 3)
   - While not unattractive, the emphasis on energy and appearance feels less relatable given my current life stage as a young married office worker balancing responsibilities.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score: 1)
   - Strongly disagree with purchasing intent due to budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND/month) and lack of compelling trust in the ad's claims.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score: 2)
   - Slightly more inclined to consider trying it if price and availability are right but not a strong inclination.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score: 3)
   - Neutral leaning towards consideration, especially given the need for energy boosts at work; yet, high emotional sensitivity makes me cautious about new purchases without deeper assurance of benefits. 

Overall, while moderately interesting and good in principle, my personal traits make it hard to fully align with an ad that leans too heavily on external appearance and instant gratification, impacting both attitude and purchase intention scores.
