**Evaluation and Explanation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **I like the ad:** (Score: 4)  
   I find it mildly appealing but not strongly so; it hints at a common concern of feeling tired and looking dull.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score: 5)  
   The message resonates with everyday experiences, making it intriguing enough to hold my attention.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score: 3)  
   While effective in raising awareness about fatigue and appearance, I'm neutral on its overall quality as an advertisement.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score: 2)  
   It lacks a strong visual appeal or emotional connection for me; it's functional but not particularly captivating.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score: 4)  
   The ad addresses my need, so I consider purchasing it as a possible solution.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score: 6)  
   There's enough encouragement and relevance for me to actively seek information or try the drink at least once.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score: 5)  
   While I'm open to considering it, my decision-making process is cautious rather than impulsive; additional factors like reviews, price, and personal need would influence a final purchase.

In summary, though not overwhelmingly persuasive, the ad effectively connects with real-life concerns and prompts me toward potential consideration or trial of the product. My moderate-to-positive scores reflect a practical approach to health and wellness needs.
