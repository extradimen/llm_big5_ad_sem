**Explanation:**

**Ad Attitude Scores:**
- **I like the ad:** (Neutral to slightly agree) While I appreciate its intention and positive messaging, it does not particularly resonate with me due to my strong preference for practicality over superficial promises.
- **I think the ad is interesting:** (Agree) The concept of staying energized appeals, but without compelling evidence or personal relevance, interest remains moderate.
- **I believe the ad is good:** (Slightly disagree) It lacks specific details about how the drink achieves these claims—more credibility and specifics would strengthen this belief.
- **I find the ad attractive:** (Strongly Disagree) The focus on "looking your best" feels more relevant to younger demographics, and as a seasoned civil servant over 60 with practical priorities, I'm less drawn by such aesthetic promises.

**Purchase Intention Scores:**
- **Intend to purchase this product:** (1 = Strongly Disagree) Despite its claims, the lack of concrete benefits and personal need make it unlikely that I would invest in purchasing.
- **Will try to buy this product:** (2 = Slightly Agree) Given my generally helpful nature and willingness to experiment for overall well-being, there's a mild curiosity but no strong impulse.
- **Consider buying this product:** (3 = Neutral) While the ad might spark some consideration due to its universal appeal of energy and health, I'd need further convincing factors—like testimonials or scientific backing—to seriously consider making a purchase. 

Overall, while not entirely dismissive, my cautious nature combined with practical life values lead me to score the ad moderately without strong intention for an immediate buy.
