**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad. (2)**: While I appreciate its intention to highlight benefits, it feels overly dramatic and slightly manipulative given my generally neutral stance on helpfulness.
- **I think the ad is interesting. (3)**: The message is somewhat intriguing but lacks depth or creative differentiation that would make me strongly engage with it.
- **I believe the ad is good. (4)**: On a scale, I find it competent and truthful in its claim but not exceptional; it just scratches the surface of addressing concerns about energy levels and appearance.
- **I find the ad attractive. (1)**: The directness makes it somewhat unattractive to my reserved nature, which leans towards subtler communication styles.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product. (2)**: Despite not being strongly convinced by the ad, I acknowledge its potential relevance.
- **I will try to buy this product. (2)**: Mild curiosity might prompt a trial if available and priced reasonably.
- **I will consider buying it. (3)**: The message aligns with my need for staying alert, so while not compelling enough to rush into purchase, I am open to considering the option when needed.

Overall, there's moderate interest but higher skepticism regarding its effectiveness, reflecting a balanced approach where cautious consideration precedes any decision-making.
