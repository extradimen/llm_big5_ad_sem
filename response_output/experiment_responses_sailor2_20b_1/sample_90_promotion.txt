**Evaluation Details:**

### **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**

  - Neutral to slightly agree; it's an appealing concept but doesn't strongly resonate given my practical nature.
  
- **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 3)**:
  - Moderately interesting due to energy and appearance benefits, though not exceptionally engaging.

- **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5)**:
  - Agreeable because it offers perceived health and confidence boosts, aligning somewhat with my self-care values.
  
- **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)**:
  - Neutral to slightly disagree; lacks strong visual appeal or emotional connection for me.

### **Purchase Intention**
- **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)**:
  - Strongly Disagree. My budgetary constraints and practical outlook make it unlikely I will commit without further evidence of cost-effectiveness.
  
- **Will try to buy this product (Score: 2)**:
  - Slightly Agree; there's some curiosity, but cautious given my current financial situation.

- **Will consider buying the product (Score: 3)**:
  - Neutral leaning toward agreement. I might weigh it in future budget reviews or if offered through discounts/promotions aligning with my spending habits.

Overall, while the ad holds mild appeal and interest, practical considerations like cost and reliability significantly impact my purchase intention as a postgraduate blue-collar worker balancing family responsibilities and financial constraints. The lack of substantial emotional draw or immediate necessity lowers its attractiveness further.
