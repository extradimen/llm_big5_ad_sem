**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the advertisement:**
   - I like the ad (2): The message is somewhat engaging but lacks personal appeal.
   - I think the ad is interesting (3): It's mildly intriguing due to addressing common feelings of tiredness and looking dull, but not exceptionally so.
   - I believe the ad is good (3): It effectively communicates its point about potential consequences without being overly persuasive or manipulative.
   - I find the ad attractive (4): The concept appeals moderately because it addresses concerns relevant for maintaining appearance and energy.

2. **Purchase intention:**
   - I intend to purchase this product (5): While not strongly compelled, there's a cautious interest driven by wanting to avoid feeling tired and looking dull.
   - I will try to buy this product (6): The ad nudges towards giving the drink a chance, especially if it promises noticeable improvements in energy levels and appearance.
   - I will consider buying this product (7): Given my generally careful approach ("do a thorough job") and tendency toward planning ("make plans"), there's high intent to evaluate the product seriously before making a purchase decision.

Overall, while not highly enthusiastic about the ad itself, its practical benefits align well with both personal concerns and methodical nature, leading to strong consideration for purchasing.
