**Explanation:**

**Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
- **I like the ad (4/7):** Neutral to slightly positive; I appreciate its intention but don't feel strongly connected.
- **Interesting (3/7):** Mildly interesting due to common health and appearance benefits, though it doesn’t excite me greatly.
- **Good (4/7):** Believe the message is generally sound regarding energy and aesthetics, but lacks personal relevance.
- **Attractive (2/7):** Not particularly appealing given my reserved nature; visuals or tone might not align with my preferences.

**Purchase Intention:**
- **Intend to purchase this product (1/7):** Strongly disagree. As a conservative spender on nonessential items, it's unlikely I'd commit without significant need.
- **Will try to buy this product (1/7):** Disagree; the ad doesn't create enough urgency or necessity for me to make an effort towards purchasing.
- **Consider buying this product (1/7):** Disagree; lacking personal resonance and given budget constraints, it won’t be on my radar despite some benefits.

Overall, while I find aspects of the advertisement reasonable, its persuasive impact is minimal due to my reserved nature, financial limitations, and prioritization of practical needs. Thus, low purchase intentions reflect this evaluation.
