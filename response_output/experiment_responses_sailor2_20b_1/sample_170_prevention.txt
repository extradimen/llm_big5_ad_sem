**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - *I like the ad.* (Score: 3): The advertisement is somewhat engaging but doesn’t strongly resonate with my talkative and outgoing personality.
   - *I think the ad is interesting.* (Score: 4): It piques curiosity about potential benefits, making it moderately interesting.
   - *I believe the ad is good.* (Score: 5): While not compelling, the message of preventing tiredness and dull looks seems straightforward and useful.
   - *I find the ad attractive.* (Score: 2): The lack of a strong emotional hook or creativity makes it less appealing.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - *I intend to purchase this product.* (Score: 3): It’s on my radar, but not at the top priority due to other daily concerns.
   - *I will try to buy this product.* (Score: 3): I might give it a shot if readily available and convenient.
   - *I will consider buying this product.* (Score: 4): Generally open-minded about trying new products, especially those promising energy boosts.

Overall, the ad effectively communicates its benefit but falls short in capturing my enthusiasm and imagination. While there’s intent to explore, immediate purchase is not guaranteed due to moderate interest levels.
