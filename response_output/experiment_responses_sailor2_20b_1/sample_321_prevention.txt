**Evaluation and Reasoning:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement (7-Point Scale):**
   - **I like the ad:** Score = 2
     * While I appreciate preventive health messages, the language feels somewhat exaggerated.
   - **Interesting:** Score = 3
     * The concept of feeling tired and looking dull resonates but it lacks unique appeal or creativity to stand out strongly.
   - **Good:** Score = 3
     * It's functional information; however, without strong personal relevance or emotional connection, I find it average rather than exceptional.
   - **Attractive:** Score = 4
     * The idea of addressing energy levels and appearance is generally attractive but not compelling enough on its own to strongly draw me in.

2. **Purchase Intention (7-Point Scale):**
   - **Intend to purchase this product:** Score = 3
     * While fatigue relief might be a concern, the ad doesn’t trigger immediate purchasing behavior without additional convincing factors.
   - **Will try to buy this product:** Score = 4
     * I'm open-minded enough to consider trying it based on its potential benefits but won't rush into an impulse buy.
   - **Consider buying this product:** Score = 5
     * It aligns with my values of maintaining health, so if the brand has good credibility and favorable reviews, there's a strong chance of making a purchase.

Overall, while I appreciate preventive wellness advertisements that address common issues like fatigue, this particular ad is moderately engaging but lacks standout persuasive elements to drive high intent. There’s a cautious consideration for possible future purchasing based on broader trust in its category.
