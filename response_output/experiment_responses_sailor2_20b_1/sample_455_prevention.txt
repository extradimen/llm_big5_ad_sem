**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
- **I like the ad. (Score: 3)**  
  I'm neutral to mildly positive; it's not offensive but also doesn't stand out.
- **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 2)**  
  It feels somewhat dull and lacks creativity, making it less engaging for me.
- **I believe the ad is good. (Score: 4)**  
  The messaging seems truthful but could be more compelling; I'm leaning towards "good enough."
- **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 1)**  
  The lack of visual appeal and emphasis on fear-based outcomes don't attract me.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product. (Score: 2)**  
  While acknowledging potential benefits, my current lifestyle and budgeting habits make an immediate buy less likely.
- **I will try to buy this product. (Score: 1)**  
  I'm not actively seeking out new products, so no strong inclination here.
- **I will consider buying this product. (Score: 1)**  
  Given my limited financial resources and priorities elsewhere, consideration is low.

Overall, the ad's messaging resonates slightly due to its relevance but isn't persuasive enough given my preferences for directness and budget constraints. Thus, purchase intent remains minimal.
