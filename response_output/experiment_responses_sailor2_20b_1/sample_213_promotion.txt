**Evaluation and Explanation:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
1. **Like (Score: 3)** - While I appreciate energetic drinks for busy schedules, the ad feels somewhat generic without specific details that resonate personally.
2. **Interesting (Score: 4)** - The promise of staying energized is engaging, but it lacks unique selling points or emotional appeal to truly captivate me.
3. **Good (Score: 5)** - Neutrally acceptable; it covers essential benefits like energy and appearance enhancement, though not extraordinary enough to stand out.
4. **Attractive (Score: 2)** - I find the ad unattractive due to its clich√©d messaging. Given my preference for originality, this fails to capture my interest.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **Intend (Score: 1)** - Strongly disagree; despite understanding its benefits, there's no compelling reason or emotional connection driving a purchase decision.
2. **Try (Score: 1)** - Similar sentiment as "intend," I have no immediate desire to sample the product without deeper engagement or personal relevance.
3. **Consider (Score: 2)** - While not highly motivated, I could consider it if there are special promotions or more compelling features that match my values for originality and practical benefits.

In summary, while acknowledging its functional goals, the advertisement falls short in emotional resonance and innovative appeal, resulting in low purchase intention scores. Personal preferences lean toward unique ideas over generic claims.
