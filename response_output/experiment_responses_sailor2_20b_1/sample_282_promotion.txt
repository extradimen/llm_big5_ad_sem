**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
  - I like the ad (4): The concept of staying energized and looking good appeals to me on a basic level.
  - I think it's interesting (3): Itâ€™s not overly compelling but captures attention with its promise.
  - I believe the ad is good (2): While clear, there isn't enough depth or personal connection for strong belief.
  - I find the ad attractive (5): The message of looking your best has some visual appeal and social value.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - I intend to purchase this product (1): Given my cautious nature towards new products and limited budget, outright intent is low.
  - I will try to buy this product (2): There's a slight curiosity but not enough convincing evidence for immediate action.
  - I will consider buying it (3): It might be worth evaluating if the opportunity presents itself or there are reviews/testimonials supporting its claims.

Overall, while my talkativeness and sociability make me receptive to such messaging, practicality and budget constraints keep purchase intentions moderate.
