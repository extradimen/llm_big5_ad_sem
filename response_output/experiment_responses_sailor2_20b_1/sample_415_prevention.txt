**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement (7-point scale):**
  - **I like the ad:** Score = 2 (Neutral leaning towards Disagree)
    - Despite being talkative and socially inclined, I don’t find this generic fear-based messaging appealing.
  - **I think the ad is interesting:** Score = 3 (Disagree)
    - The claim feels too clichéd and doesn't grab my attention or imagination with originality.
  - **I believe the ad is good:** Score = 4 (Neutral leaning towards Agree)
    - It has a functional purpose, but its execution lacks creativity to make it genuinely compelling for me.
  - **I find the ad attractive:** Score = 3 (Disagree)
    - The overall presentation doesn't align with my preference for thoroughness or emotional stability.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product:** Score = 1 (Strongly Disagree)
    - Given that I strongly disagree with the ad's approach and don’t see a strong personal need, there’s no intention to buy.
  - **Will try to buy this product:** Score = 2 (Disagree)
    - While not entirely ruling out future curiosity, current dissatisfaction makes me unlikely to make an effort for purchase.
  - **Consider buying the product:** Score = 3 (Neutral leaning towards Disagree)
    - There’s minimal consideration due to skepticism about its efficacy and relevance in my daily life.

Overall, though I have some active imagination and originality traits that could be swayed by a well-crafted ad, this particular one misses the mark significantly. It lacks persuasive power for someone with my specific values and preferences, resulting in low engagement scores and minimal purchase intent.
