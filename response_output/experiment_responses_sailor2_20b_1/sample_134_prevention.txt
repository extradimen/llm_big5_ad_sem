**Evaluation Breakdown:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:** 
  - I like the ad (Score: 2): While not strongly negative, it does not resonate with my personality given my preference for straightforward information over emotional appeals.
  - It is interesting (Score: 3): Neutral to slightly agree; the concept isn't groundbreaking or engaging enough considering my general indifference toward persuasive tactics.
  - I believe the ad is good (Score: 4): Mildly positive, acknowledging that it delivers a clear message but without significant impact.
  - Find it attractive (Score: 2): Low attraction due to its reliance on negative reinforcement which doesn’t align with my emotional stability and preference for directness.

- **Purchase Intention:** 
  - I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1): Strongly disagree; the ad’s style does not prompt me to make a deliberate purchasing decision.
  - Will try to buy it (Score: 2): Slightly agree, indicating minimal curiosity but no strong intention due to perceived lack of need or relevance in my lifestyle.
  - Will consider buying it (Score: 2): Light consideration only; the ad might trigger mild awareness without compelling me towards an actual purchase.

Overall, while not entirely dismissive, this Southeast Asian civil servant with a conservative attitude and practical outlook finds the advertisement unappealing for personal consumption due to its manipulative undertones and lack of alignment with his lifestyle preferences.
