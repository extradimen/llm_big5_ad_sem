**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
   - **Like:** Neutral leaning slightly negative (score of 3) due to a preference for more engaging content and my sometimes rude tendencies.
   - **Interesting:** Somewhat interesting but not captivating enough (4).
   - **Good:** Doubtful about its effectiveness and relevance, score is low at 2.
   - **Attractive:** The ad lacks allure given the claims feel generic; hence a moderate score of 3.

- **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Strongly disagree (1) because I don't see immediate benefits or urgency compelling me to buy this drink.
   - **Try to Buy:** Slightly open to trying it out, scoring a cautious 2 due to curiosity but not high commitment.
   - **Consider Buying:** There's minimal consideration for now; hence score is 3.

In summary, while the ad is somewhat tolerable and interesting in parts, its overall appeal falls short of convincing me as an ideal consumer. My skepticism about effectiveness aligns with my personality traits (careless tendencies, high anxiety), leading to low purchase intent scores.
