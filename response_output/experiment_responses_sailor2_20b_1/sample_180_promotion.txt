**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad (6):** I appreciate its energetic tone and visual appeal but find it somewhat oversimplified.
   - **Interesting (5):** It piques my curiosity as a talkative, outgoing person seeking energy boost solutions.
   - **Believe the Ad is Good (4):** While persuasive, the claims feel generic; more specific evidence would strengthen credibility for me.
   - **Attractive (3):** The message aligns with wanting to look best but lacks the emotional resonance and originality I prefer.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase this Product (2):** Although attractive, practical concerns about cost vs. benefits weigh in negatively.
   - **Try to Buy this Product (1.5):** Neutral-to-negative; requires a stronger personal connection or loyalty program incentive.
   - **Consider Buying the Product (2.5):** Despite low initial interest, an active imagination and originality traits make me open to future reviews/testimonials before deciding.

Overall, while I respond positively to its engaging presentation, more depth in benefits and customization would sway my purchase intention higher.
