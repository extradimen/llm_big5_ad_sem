**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - **Like:** Neutral, as being talkative and outgoing doesn't strongly connect to energy drinks but is an acceptable idea.
  - **Interesting:** Agree, due to my active imagination and originality; the concept of staying energized resonates somewhat creatively.
  - **Good:** Disagree, given the lackluster appeal for a blue-collar worker who values practical solutions over cosmetic benefits.
  - **Attractive:** Strongly disagree, as it feels superficial compared to real-life needs like health, family, and work stability.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend:** Strongly Disagree. Despite my active lifestyle, the ad's primary focus on appearance doesn't align with my priorities.
  - **Try:** Disagree; I wonâ€™t proactively seek out this product when other known energy sources (e.g., proper diet and sleep) are more effective and trusted solutions in my experience.
  - **Consider:** Somewhat Consider. If circumstances change, offering tangible benefits like improved endurance or better nutrition over "looking good," it might gain consideration.

Overall, while the ad sparks curiosity due to personal traits, its emphasis on appearance feels out of sync with practical needs and values, making purchase intent low but open for reassessment under different marketing angles.
