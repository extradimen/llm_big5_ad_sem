**Detailed Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad (5/7):** The tagline sounds appealing and relevant to maintaining energy levels, which resonates with my lifestyle as an office worker.
   - **Interesting (6/7):** I find it intriguing that a drink can address both physical performance and appearance; this dual benefit sparks curiosity.
   - **Good (4.5/7):** While the message is engaging, credibility isn't fully conveyed without specific evidence or brand reputation awareness.
   - **Attractive (5/7):** The ad appeals to self-improvement goals but might lack emotional depth to compel strong attraction.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product (3/7):** My cautious nature and low monthly income make me hesitant, though the idea is appealing.
   - **Will try to buy (2.5/7):** I'm inclined towards trying if it's affordable or during special offers but not immediately committed due to budget constraints.
   - **Consider buying (3.5/7):** The product fits some needs, so I'll keep an eye out for promotions and reviews before making a decision.

Balancing my talkative yet reserved nature, along with practical concerns about cost and effectiveness, the advertisement is moderately favorable but requires additional reassurance to convert into purchase intent.
