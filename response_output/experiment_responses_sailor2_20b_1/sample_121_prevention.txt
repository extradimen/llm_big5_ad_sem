**Explanation:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad (score: 4)**:
   - Despite being talkative and helpful, I find it neutral to slightly positive as the prevention aspect resonates with my health-conscious nature.

2. **I think the ad is interesting (score: 3)**:
   - It’s engaging but doesn’t captivate me deeply given my reserved personality.

3. **I believe the ad is good (score: 2)**:
   - The message about tiredness and dull appearance lacks emotional depth or novelty, making it less convincing.

4. **I find the ad attractive (score: 3)**:
   - It’s moderately appealing but not strongly so due to my reserved nature and preference for more personalized experiences.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product (score: 3)**:
   - Neutral leaning towards "consider" as I acknowledge the possible benefits, though it doesn't excite me enough to immediately buy.

2. **I will try to buy this product (score: 2)**:
   - Mild inclination due to its preventive health aspect but not strong enough for an active pursuit.

3. **I will consider buying this product (score: 1)**:
   - Low score indicates that while I'm aware of the potential value, other priorities and alternatives might take precedence before making a purchase decision.

Overall, although the ad presents a valid concern, my reserved nature, lack of strong emotional connection, and cautious approach to health products result in moderate positive attitudes but low purchasing intentions.
