**Explanation:**

### **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad (Score: 4)**:
   - As a talkative person with social tendencies leaning neutral but generally valuing efficiency over superficial appeals, I appreciate its straightforward message.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 3)**:
   - The promise of staying energized and looking good might appeal briefly, but it lacks novelty for me.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 2)**:
   - While functional benefits are nice, they feel generic compared to specific health or personal care needs I prioritize.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 1)**:
   - The overall presentation isn't particularly compelling given my reserved nature and tendency towards practicality.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)**
   - Low intent due to budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND/month), skepticism about the effectiveness, and other priority expenses.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)**:
   - If it's inexpensive or part of a promotional offer, I might give it a chance but not actively seek out.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 1)**
   - Very low likelihood; other more essential needs and limited income outweigh any perceived benefits from the ad's promise.

Overall, while there are minor positive aspects in terms of presentation, my pragmatic outlook and budgetary concerns heavily influence a negative attitude towards purchasing.
