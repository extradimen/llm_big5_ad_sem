**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - *I like the ad:* Neutral (3) – I don't dislike but also not overly enthusiastic.
   - *Interesting:* Disagree (2) – The basic claim of "staying energized and looking your best" is quite generic, so it doesn’t excite me much.
   - *Good:* Agree (4) – While the message isn't groundbreaking, its simplicity can be seen as effective for daily routines.
   - *Attractive:* Strongly Agree (5+) – The promise of enhanced energy levels and appearance appeals to my practical needs.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *Intend to purchase this product:* 4 (Agree) – I'm not compelled enough to buy immediately but open-minded.
   - *Will try to buy this product:* 6 (Strongly Agree) – Given the reasonable appeal and my need for a reliable energy boost, trying it out seems logical.
   - *Consider buying this product:* 7 (Strongest Agreement) – Despite some reservations about marketing simplicity, overall I find the concept valuable enough to include in future purchases.

By balancing personality traits like being generally trusting but cautious with practical needs, these scores reflect both my appreciation for straightforward health promises and realistic expectations. The ad does its job well enough without overwhelming me; thus, it warrants a serious consideration for purchase.
