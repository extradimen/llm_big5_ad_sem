**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude Toward Ad**:  
   * I like the ad: Neutral because it resonates somewhat but not strongly.
   * I think the ad is interesting: Agreed as the idea of staying energized appeals to me.
   * I believe the ad is good: Strongly Agree, valuing its claims on energy and appearance improvement.
   * I find the ad attractive: Somewhat less than neutral; while useful features are highlighted, it lacks strong emotional appeal for me.

2. **Purchase Intention**:  
   * I intend to purchase this product: Low intention due to financial constraints but open-minded about benefits.
   * I will try to buy this product: Neutral â€” might consider a trial given the need for energy boost and appearance management.
   * I will consider buying this product: Strong consideration, particularly influenced by trust in advertised outcomes.

In summary, while not highly enthusiastic about the ad's presentation (attractive factor), its clear benefits align well with my lifestyle needs. Therefore, I am inclined to seriously consider purchasing despite minor reservations. The balance of being helpful and practical drives higher purchase intention scores.
