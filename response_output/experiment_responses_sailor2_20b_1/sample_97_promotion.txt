**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - *Like (score = 3)*: As someone who is reserved and doesn't find ads particularly engaging but values helpfulness, I appreciate the sentiment behind staying energized; however, it's not compelling enough to generate strong personal appeal.
   - *Interesting (score = 4)*: The concept of being more energetic is intriguing, especially for a busy civil servant. It holds some relevance in daily life.
   - *Good (score = 5)*: The message seems well-intentioned and potentially beneficial but lacks the emotional connection or depth to stand out strongly.
   - *Attractive (score = 4)*: Though not overly attractive, it aligns with a functional goal which makes it somewhat appealing.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend to Purchase (score = 2)*: While I see the benefits of staying energized, my reserved nature and tendency toward careful decision-making reduce immediate intent.
   - *Will Try (score = 3)*: There's a mild curiosity about trying it since maintaining energy is important; however, hesitation persists due to neutral-to-negative aspects in the ad for me personally.
   - *Consider Buying (score = 4)*: Given my unselfish nature and practical outlook, I'm open to considering this product if others report good results or during periods when I need extra support.

Overall, while I appreciate the functional benefits highlighted, the advertisement does not strongly resonate with my personality traits. It remains moderately appealing but doesn't drive a high purchase intent without additional validation from peers or personal experience.
