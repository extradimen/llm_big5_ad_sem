**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad (score: 4):** Neutral to slightly positive; while I appreciate its energy-focused message, it doesn't excite me enough.
   - **Interesting (3):** The concept is somewhat interesting due to my active lifestyle as a civil servant but lacks depth for personal engagement.
   - **Good (5):** I think the ad effectively communicates staying energized and looking good, which aligns with general health goals; thus, it's decently crafted.
   - **Attractive (2):** Not very visually or emotionally attractive to me due to my reserved nature and lower inclination towards outward appearances.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product (score: 2):** Low intention because I prioritize practicality over cosmetic benefits, given my current responsibilities and financial situation.
   - **Will try to buy the product (3):** Mild curiosity but not strong enough motivation to actively seek out a trial based on daily usage or necessity.
   - **Consider buying the product (4):** Open to consideration if there are specific health improvements reported by peers or trusted sources, balancing my need for energy with cautious spending habits.

Overall, while the ad resonates somewhat due to its targeted messaging, it doesn't strongly influence my purchase decision based on my reserved personality and practical priorities. The positive but moderate scores reflect a balanced view of interest without high commitment.
