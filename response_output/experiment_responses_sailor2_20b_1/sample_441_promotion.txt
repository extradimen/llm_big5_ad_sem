**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **I like the ad:** (Score = 3)
   - Given my reserved nature and slight preference for calmness over energy boosts, I find it neutral to slightly positive but not very appealing.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score = 4)
   - The promise of staying energized could catch attention, making it somewhat intriguing, though not overwhelmingly so.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score = 5) 
   - I find value in health and wellness messages; however, without strong personal resonance with its claims, my belief remains neutral to slightly positive.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score = 2)
   - Being reserved, I’m less inclined towards flashy or highly energizing visuals or language, making it unattractive to me on an emotional level.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score = 1)
   - My low income and cautious nature mean that unless there's a compelling need, I am unlikely to commit to buying such products impulsively.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score = 2) 
   - There’s minimal inclination due to budget constraints but slight curiosity if the brand has good word-of-mouth or reliability.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score = 3)
   - While I don't feel strongly compelled, it doesn’t entirely dismiss potential future consideration based on reviews and price points that align with my budget. 

Overall, while not a strong negative reaction, the ad falls short of convincing me to act as an active consumer due to personal preferences and financial constraints. It's neutral-to-mildly-positive in attitude but leads to low purchase intentions for now.
