**Evaluation Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the advertisement:**
  - *Like (4)*: Neutral with a slight positive leaning due to its appeal to looking good and staying energized.
  - *Interesting (5)*: Find it engaging because of modern health-conscious themes appealing in Southeast Asia.
  - *Good (6)*: View it favorably as the messaging aligns well with wellness trends, though not overwhelmingly compelling.
  - *Attractive (3)*: Less visually or emotionally attractive; needs stronger visual appeal and personal relevance.

- **Purchase intention:**
  - *Intend to purchase (2)*: While interested in the benefits, a strong intent isn't present due to budget constraints and other options available.
  - *Try (2)*: Might give it a chance if price is reasonable or thereâ€™s an introductory offer. 
  - *Consider buying (3)*: Will definitely consider this product but not at full-price without further incentives or positive reviews.

Overall, the ad resonates on some levels but falls short in building strong purchase intent given personal financial priorities and cautious shopping behavior.
