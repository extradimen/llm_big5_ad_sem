**Evaluation:**

### **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
1. **Like:** Score = 5 (Neutral)
   - While I appreciate the straightforward messaging about fatigue and dull appearance, it doesn't evoke a strong emotional connection or excitement.
   
2. **Interesting:** Score = 4 (Slightly Agree)
   - The ad is clear but lacks creativity or novelty to captivate my interest fully.

3. **Good:** Score = 6 (Agree)
   - I find the message effective and relevant for anyone experiencing tiredness, providing a simple solution â€“ hence its merit as good information.

4. **Attractive:** Score = 4 (Neutral)
   - The ad's visual appeal is adequate but not particularly engaging or memorable; it feels somewhat generic.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **Intend to Purchase:** Score = 3 (Somewhat Disagree)
   - Despite the effectiveness of the messaging, there are many factors involved in making a purchase decision, including personal health routines and budget considerations. It doesn't push me over the edge to commit immediately.
   
2. **Try to Buy this Product:** Score = 2 (Disagree)
   - I might not prioritize trying it out without additional information or reviews from trusted sources.

3. **Consider Buying:** Score = 1 (Strongly Disagree)
   - Given my generally thorough approach and careful decision-making, the current ad isn't enough to make me seriously consider purchasing this product over others in the market.

In summary, while I recognize its relevance and utility, the advertisement falls short on emotional engagement, creativity, and sufficient persuasion for a civil servant with strong practicality values like mine. Therefore, my purchase intent remains low despite acknowledging its potential benefits.
