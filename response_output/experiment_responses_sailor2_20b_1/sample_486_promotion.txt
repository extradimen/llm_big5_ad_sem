**Evaluation Details:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like (4)**: Despite being talkative and somewhat agreeable to helpfulness, this ad doesn't fully connect with my everyday priorities or concerns.
2. **Interesting (3)**: It's mildly intriguing but not engaging enough given my reserved nature; it feels a bit too generic for me personally.
3. **Good (2)**: I see value in staying energized and looking good, but the message lacks specific relevance to my current needs as a blue-collar worker with limited income.
4. **Attractive (2)**: The appeal is minimal due to its broad claims; it doesn't resonate strongly enough considering my reserved personality.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase**: *1* - Strongly Disagree
   Given my financial constraints (< 15,000,000 VND monthly income), the cost-effectiveness of this drink is a major concern.
2. **Try to buy**: *2* - Neutral 
   There might be curiosity to give it a try if offered at a reasonable price or during sales, but no strong push from the ad alone.
3. **Consider buying**: *2* - Neutral
   While I appreciate its promise of energy and appearance benefits, my cautious nature (disagreement with thorough job completion) means I will be hesitant without further assurance or incentives.

Overall, though not completely dismissive, this advertisement falls short in appealing to my specific needs, values, and financial reality. Therefore, both attitude scores are moderate at best, while purchase intention remains low due to budget constraints and reserved nature towards product promises.
