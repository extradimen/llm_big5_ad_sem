**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**  
    - **I like the ad (Score: 3)**: Neutral as it resonates slightly but lacks personal appeal due to its general nature.
    - **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)**: Agree that it provides a clear message, but not particularly engaging.
    - **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5)**: Slightly agree because of its straightforward prevention approach, though it could be more compelling.
    - **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)**: Strongly Disagree; lacks visual or emotional attractiveness.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
    - **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)**: Strongly Disagree. The advertisement's claims don't align with my current needs.
    - **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)**: Slightly Agree; might give it a chance if other factors were compelling, but not likely on its own merit.
    - **I will consider buying this product (Score: 2)**: Neutral; open-minded, but not actively considering based solely on the ad.

Overall, while acknowledging its preventive message's validity, the advertisement falls short in engagement and doesn't align well with my proactive lifestyle or emotional state. Thus, it lacks sufficient persuasiveness for a purchase decision at this point.
