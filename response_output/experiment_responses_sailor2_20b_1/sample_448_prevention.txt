**Evaluation:**

* **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
    - **Like (score=3)**: The ad's messaging feels somewhat relevant to my daily experiences but doesn't deeply engage me.
    - **Interesting (score=4)**: It raises an identifiable issue of fatigue, making it mildly interesting, particularly for those who work physically demanding jobs like mine.
    - **Good (score=3)**: While the concept is sound, its execution feels a bit cliché and lacks novelty or unique presentation to stand out.
    - **Attractive (score=2)**: The ad appears too generic; it doesn’t grab my attention effectively due to poor creativity and overused tiredness imagery.

* **Purchase Intention**
    - **Intend to purchase this product (score=1)**: Despite the issue of fatigue, given my monthly income constraints (<15,000,000 VND), high-priced energy drinks are non-starters for me.
    - **Will try to buy this product (score=2)**: There's a slight inclination if it were affordable or offered in small packs but not enough to actively seek out the purchase.
    - **Consider buying this product (score=2)**: The idea of relief from fatigue does weigh, yet other budget priorities and potential health skepticism prevent a strong consideration.

Overall, while I acknowledge its relevance, the ad lacks compelling appeal and practicality for my situation. Hence, low scores reflect both an uninspired attitude toward the advertisement and limited purchase intention despite understanding the problem it addresses.
