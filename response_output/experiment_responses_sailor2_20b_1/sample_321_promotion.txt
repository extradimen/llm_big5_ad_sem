**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **I like the ad. (Score: 4)**: Neutral leaning towards positive due to helpful imagery but not compelling enough personally.
  - **Interesting**: Slightly engaging at a 3 out of 7, since it aligns with my preference for energy and well-being but lacks emotional resonance or novelty.
  - **Believe the ad is good (Score: 5)**: Generally agreeable; see value in staying energized and looking best daily. However, skepticism remains about its effectiveness.
  - **Attractive**: Only a 2 because it doesn't particularly catch my reserved attention nor feel tailored to me despite being an important aspect for many.

- **Purchase Intention Scores**:
  - **Intend to purchase (Score: 2)**: Minimal intention; though health-conscious, personal care is balanced with budget constraints and practical efficacy concerns.
  - **Try the product**: Strongly disagree at a 1. No immediate desire or urgency without more convincing evidence or discounts.
  - **Consider buying (Score: 1)**: Even slightly considerate score of 1 since I acknowledge its relevance but am not swayed enough to act on it.

Overall, while appreciating wellness messages in the ad, my personality traits and cautious nature lead me towards a low purchase intention despite some positive attributes.
