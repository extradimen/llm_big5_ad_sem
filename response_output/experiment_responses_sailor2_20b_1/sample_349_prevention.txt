**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Evaluation:
1. **I like the ad:** (2) - Although I appreciate its direct messaging about avoiding fatigue and dullness, my reserved nature leans towards a mild disapproval of overly promotional content.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (3) - Neutral leaning towards agreeable; it presents an immediate problem-solution scenario which can be engaging if you're familiar with such needs.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** (4) - It's effective in highlighting a common issue but falls short of strong engagement for me given my cautious approach to marketing claims.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** (5) - Slightly above neutral; the visual appeal and clear messaging are moderately appealing, but not enough to strongly attract.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (4) - While I recognize the need for a boost in energy or appearance, my strong tendency towards worrying and skepticism means it won't be an immediate buy.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** (6) - Given its relevance to maintaining productivity and self-image, there is a moderate inclination to give it a trial under specific circumstances.
3. **I will consider buying the product:** (7) - The strong emphasis on originality and new ideas aligns with my personality trait; hence, I am likely to seriously contemplate this purchase for potential benefits.

Overall, while not overly enthusiastic about the ad due to its promotional nature and some personal reservations, it holds enough merit to warrant thoughtful consideration for purchase.
