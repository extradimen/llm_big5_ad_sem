**Evaluation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **1. I like the ad:** Neutral (3) – The ad message is relevant to fatigue and appearance, but doesn’t personally excite or engage me due to my reserved nature.
  - **2. I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (4) – It captures a common concern among office workers, making it relatable.
  - **3. I believe the ad is good:** Strongly Agree (5) – The straightforward prevention message appeals to health-conscious individuals like me who value well-being.
  - **4. I find the ad attractive:** Disagree (2) – While effective in its purpose, the presentation may need more creativity or personal connection for it to be truly compelling.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **1. I intend to purchase this product:** Consider (3) – The benefits resonate with my needs but other factors like budget and brand familiarity will weigh into a decision.
  - **2. I will try to buy this product:** Try (4) – There’s enough interest to test if it improves energy levels without making an immediate commitment.
  - **3. I will consider buying this product:** Consider (4) – It aligns with my desire for self-care, so I’m open but cautious about the purchase.

In summary, while the ad effectively communicates its message and is generally appreciated, a more engaging presentation could enhance appeal. My reserved nature means strong attraction isn’t guaranteed, but it prompts serious consideration and potential trial of the product due to practical benefits.
