**Evaluation and Explanation:**

### Attitudes towards the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 5)**  
   - While I appreciate the promise of staying energized and looking good, it's a bit idealistic for my daily routine as a blue-collar worker.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)**  
   - The concept resonates somewhat but feels slightly removed from my practical needs; more specifics would enhance its appeal.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 6)**  
   - It presents positive attributes I value, especially energy and appearance, though the claim seems a bit generic for me to strongly agree upon.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3)**  
   - The messaging isn't compelling enough given my preference for tangible benefits over vague promises.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)**  
   - Although it aligns with desirable outcomes, there's no immediate need or urgency in my current budget and lifestyle.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 3)**  
   - Neutral inclination; I might give it a shot if the price is reasonable and reviews are positive but not actively seeking it out right now.
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 4)**  
   - The idea isn't dismissed, so consideration remains open for future use or special occasions, particularly focusing on its cost-effectiveness.

In summary, while I appreciate the goals outlined in the ad, my practical priorities and budget constraints make it moderately appealing without driving immediate purchase intent.
