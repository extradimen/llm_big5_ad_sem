**Evaluation Explanation:**

### **Ad Attitudes**
- **I like the ad:** *(Score: 3)* - While I appreciate energetic and appearance-focused content, my reserved nature and lack of excitement about flashy marketing makes me indifferent.
  
- **I think the ad is interesting:** *(Score: 4)* - It captures attention with its promise of energy and looks, but it doesn't deeply engage me due to limited personal relevance.

- **I believe the ad is good:** *(Score: 2)* - Neutral on credibility; the claims are appealing, yet my cautious nature questions whether these benefits will be noticeable or sustainable.

- **I find the ad attractive:** *(Score: 1)* - Strongly disagree because it doesn't align with my reserved and sometimes cynical outlook. The imagery feels more aspirational than relatable to me.

### **Purchase Intention**
- **I intend to purchase this product:** *(Score: 2)* - Low intention; despite being a student who needs energy, I'm cautious about the price and skeptical without personal experience or reviews from trusted sources.
  
- **I will try to buy this product:** *(Score: 2)* - Minimal motivation to actively seek it out since my budget is tight (<15,000,000 VND per month), and there are uncertainties regarding its effectiveness.

- **I will consider buying the product:** *(Score: 3)* - Open-minded but not decisive. The ad might prompt me to evaluate options further if faced with a need for increased energy or confidence boost during stressful periods like exams.

In summary, while I understand the appeal of staying energized and looking good, my reserved nature and practical considerations significantly lower both engagement with the advertisement and purchase intention. A more grounded approach would likely be needed before making an actual buying decision.
