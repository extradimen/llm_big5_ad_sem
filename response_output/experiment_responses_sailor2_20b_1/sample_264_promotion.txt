**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score = 3):**
   - While not strongly negative or unlikable, it doesn't excite me due to my practical nature and preference for actionable content over generic promises.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score = 4):**
   - Neutral leaning towards agree; keeps attention but lacks compelling features given my background as a blue-collar worker focusing on efficiency and reliability rather than aesthetics.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score = 5):**
   - Considerably higher, indicating I see it as credible in its intent to promote energy and appearance benefits—valuable for someone like me who values performance but with reservations about overemphasizing superficial aspects.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score = 4):**
   - Slightly positive; visually engaging ads might draw initial interest, though not enough to strongly attract.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score = 2):**
   - Low intent despite believing in its value; priorities are aligned more with utility and necessity over appearance-related products.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score = 2):**
   - Similar low motivation due to practical lifestyle focus—might consider a trial but not actively seeking it out.
3. **I will consider buying the product (Score = 3):**
   - Moderate consideration; while finding appeal, the decision hinges on specific needs or context rather than being an immediate priority.

Overall, I appreciate the message's intent and see its relevance to well-being, yet practicality and existing financial priorities tilt towards a more cautious purchase approach. The ad scores reflect balanced engagement without strong emotional pull toward immediate action.
