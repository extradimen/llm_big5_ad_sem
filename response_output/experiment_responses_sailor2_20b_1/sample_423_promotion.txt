**Evaluation Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
   - *I like the ad.* (Score: 2)  
     The talkative and somewhat outgoing nature may appreciate an energizing drink concept but not strongly resonate with it.
   - *I think the ad is interesting.* (Score: 3)
     Neutral perception on creativity; more focused on functionality rather than novelty.
   - *I believe the ad is good.* (Score: 4)  
     The emphasis on staying energized aligns somewhat, but not enough to convince strongly given my cautious tendencies and low trust in quick fixes.
   - *I find the ad attractive.* (Score: 5)
     Visually appealing aspects may draw some attention but do not spark strong engagement due to general nervousness and concern for practical outcomes.

- **Purchase Intention**
   - *I intend to purchase this product.* (Score: 3)  
     While thereâ€™s interest, my financial constraints ($<15 million VND/month) make a direct purchase less likely.
   - *I will try to buy this product.* (Score: 4)
     Curiosity is present, especially considering the stress-reducing effects and energy boost, but not enough urgency for an immediate trial.
   - *I will consider buying this product.* (Score: 6)  
     The promise of looking better aligns with a cautious yet somewhat open approach to potential self-improvement products. Regular consideration is likely.

Overall, the ad garners moderate positive scores due to personal needs but falls short in compelling action due to financial limitations and inherent skepticism about fast solutions for stress and appearance improvements.
