**Explanation:**

**Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
1. **I like the ad:** (3) — While I appreciate some aspects of energy drinks for daily routines, it doesn't align strongly with my personal preferences.
2. **Interesting:** (4) — The concept is moderately intriguing but not enough to captivate me fully given my current lifestyle and needs.
3. **Good Advertisement:** (2) — It seems generic; more specific claims or tailored messaging would improve its effectiveness for people like me.
4. **Attractive:** (1) — Lacking visual appeal, emotional resonance, or a strong connection with my values makes it unappealing.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **Intend to purchase this product:** (2) — It's not high on my priority list despite the benefits mentioned; there are alternatives I prefer.
2. **Try to buy this product:** (3) — If available and convenient, I might give it a shot but won't actively seek it out.
3. **Consider buying this product:** (3) — The idea doesn’t dismiss entirely—under certain circumstances, like special promotions or better packaging/reviews, I may reconsider.

Overall, the advertisement fails to resonate deeply with my background, personality traits, and current needs. While not completely off-putting, it lacks sufficient appeal to drive a strong purchase intention. Specificity in messaging might enhance its effectiveness for individuals like myself.
