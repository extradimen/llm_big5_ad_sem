**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** 
   - *I like the ad (Score: 3):* While I appreciate its intent to energize and enhance appearance, my reserved nature makes me indifferent.
   - *Interesting (Score: 2):* The promise of staying energetic appeals slightly but lacks compelling features for engagement.
   - *Good (Score: 4):* It conveys a positive message, which aligns with some agreeable traits; however, it doesn’t resonate strongly enough.
   - *Attractive (Score: 2):* The ad appears basic and somewhat clichéd in its approach. Given my strong preference for directness over glossy promises, I find it mildly unappealing.

- **Purchase intention:** 
   - *Intend to purchase this product (Score: 1):* With a monthly income of VND 26M-35M, energy drinks might not be a priority in my budget-conscious mindset.
   - *Try to buy this product (Score: 1):* Lack of urgency or personal relevance means I have no immediate incentive to try it out.
   - *Consider buying this product (Score: 2):* Though neutral on emotional stability, the overall unimpressive presentation makes me unlikely but marginally open to considering future purchase if circumstances change.

Overall, while there are some positive aspects in its messaging, my practical nature and cautious approach render low enthusiasm both for the ad itself and actual purchasing behavior.
