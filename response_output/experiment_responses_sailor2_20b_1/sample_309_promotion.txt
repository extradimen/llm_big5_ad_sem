**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 4)** - While I appreciate the goal of staying energized and looking good, it doesn't particularly excite me.
2. **Interesting (Score: 3)** - The message is standard for energy drinks; not groundbreaking but straightforward enough to be engaging.
3. **Good (Score: 2)** - It lacks depth in details that would make it more persuasive or compelling, especially with my Strongly Agree focus on thoroughness and credibility.
4. **Attractive (Score: 5)** - The concept resonates somewhat since staying energized is important to maintain productivity; the visual appeal could be better.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)** - Given my low income, I prioritize cost-effective solutions over premium energy drinks.
2. **Try to buy this product (Score: 2)** - There's a slight curiosity but not strong enough to prompt an immediate trial.
3. **Consider buying the product (Score: 3)** - While it aligns with some needs, other budget-friendly alternatives are more likely on my list.

Overall, while I find aspects of the ad appealing and understand its value proposition, practical considerations like affordability heavily influence my decision not to purchase at this time.
