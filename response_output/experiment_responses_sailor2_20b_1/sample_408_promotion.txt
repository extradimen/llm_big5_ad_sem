**Evaluation:**

**Ad Attitude Scores**
1. **I like the ad:** (Score: 3) - Neutral
   - While I appreciate its intent to promote energy and appearance benefits, it doesn't strike a chord strongly enough given my personal experiences.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score: 4)
   - It offers some engaging claims, but there isn’t much that excites me or makes me feel unique about this product compared to others in the market.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score: 5) 
   - The message is clear and potentially effective for a broad audience; however, it doesn't cater specifically to my needs as an individual.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score: 2)
   - Its presentation lacks appeal or emotional connection with me due to its generalized approach rather than personalized messaging.

**Purchase Intention Scores**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score: 1) 
   - Based on my current preferences and priorities, I don’t see a strong reason to buy it right now. Other factors take precedence in my budget.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score: 2)
   - While the idea of energy boosting is appealing, there are numerous alternatives that better align with my lifestyle at present; hence, trying isn't high on my list.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score: 3) 
   - I won’t dismiss it entirely and might revisit if circumstances change or if the brand offers more compelling incentives tailored to Southeast Asian consumers like myself.

Overall, while I find aspects of the ad reasonable, its persuasive impact on my purchase decision remains low due to a lack of personal relevance and immediate need.
