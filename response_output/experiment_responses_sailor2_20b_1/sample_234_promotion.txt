**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad (Score: 2)**: Given my reserved nature and tendency to be strongly disagreeable with being outgoing or talkative, I find such energetic claims unrelatable.
- **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 3)**: Neutral curiosity due to an active imagination but overall not engaging enough for strong interest. 
- **I believe the ad is good (Score: 4)**: Slightly positive leaning towards its concept of energy and appearance benefits, albeit moderately.
- **I find the ad attractive (Score: 1)**: Strongly disagree; it feels superficial and doesn't resonate with my values.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)**: No intention due to low alignment with my reserved nature, skepticism about such claims, and limited budget.
- **I will try to buy this product (Score: 1)**: Not inclined to make a trial purchase because it doesnâ€™t fit into my lifestyle or priorities.
- **I will consider buying the product (Score: 2)**: Slightly open to considering if the price fits within my <15,000,000 VND budget and there's compelling evidence of its benefits.

Overall, while I acknowledge its existence and potential utility at a low score range, personal values, financial constraints, and skepticism keep me from finding it persuasive enough for purchase.
