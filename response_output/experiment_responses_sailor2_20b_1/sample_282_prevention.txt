**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
  - **Like (4/7):** The ad is mildly appealing but not particularly engaging.
  - **Interesting (3/7):** It holds some interest as it addresses fatigue and appearance concerns relevant to daily life.
  - **Good (2/7):** While it presents a clear message, the overall execution seems generic and lacks originality or excitement.
  - **Attractive (1/7):** The ad isn't very visually appealing or emotionally resonant for me.

- **Purchase Intention**
  - **Intend to purchase:** I'm not strongly inclined to buy based on this single ad. 
  - **Try to Buy:** There's a mild curiosity and willingness to explore the product if it's available nearby.
  - **Consider Buying:** The concern about feeling tired or looking dull is familiar, so thereâ€™s consideration but no immediate urgency.

**Summary:**
The advertisement effectively identifies common daily issues but fails to capture my attention due to its lack of creativity and emotional depth. Although relevant to me as an office worker dealing with fatigue, it doesn't drive a strong purchase intent alone. I'm open to trying the product if given another reason or context beyond this ad's presentation.
