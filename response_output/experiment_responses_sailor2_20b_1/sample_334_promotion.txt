**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**  
  1. **Like (5):** I appreciate its upbeat messaging but find it slightly over-the-top for my taste.
  2. **Interesting (4):** The concept of staying energized is appealing, though it doesn't captivate me entirely.
  3. **Good (6):** It conveys clear benefits that resonate with health-conscious consumers.
  4. **Attractive (3):** While not unattractive, I prefer ads with more personal or relatable elements.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
  1. **Intend to Purchase (2):** The appeal isn't strong enough for a firm purchase decision based solely on the ad.
  2. **Will Try to Buy (3):** If there's additional information such as user reviews, discounts, or brand credibility, I might consider giving it a try.
  3. **Consider Buying (4):** The product aligns with my desire for energy and appearance maintenance; thus, I am open to considering it.

Overall, the ad is somewhat appealing but lacks a compelling reason to spur immediate purchase intent due to factors like personal preferences and skepticism about generic claims. Additional context or tangible benefits would be needed to boost my interest significantly.
