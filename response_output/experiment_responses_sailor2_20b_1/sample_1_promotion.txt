**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the advertisement:**  
   1. **I like the ad (4/7):** The promotional tone aligns with my preference for engaging content but it doesn't excite me strongly.
   2. **Interesting (5/7):** Itâ€™s somewhat interesting, given its promise of energy and appearance benefits, fitting well within daily needs.
   3. **Good (6/7):** As a generally trusting individual, I find the claims plausible enough to consider them valid.
   4. **Attractive (3/7):** While not highly attractive, it resonates with aspects like being sociable and valuing self-care.

- **Purchase intention:**  
   1. **Intend to purchase this product (2/7):** Not a strong drive; more of an 'it could be useful' mindset.
   2. **Will try to buy this product (3/7):** Openness to giving it a try, especially if the benefits are evident and align with my lifestyle needs.
   3. **Consider buying this product (2/7):** The ad sparks mild consideration but does not push me towards an immediate purchase decision.

Overall, while I find the ad somewhat engaging and reasonable, it doesn't evoke strong emotional or urgent action from me as a consumer within Southeast Asia's managerial class. Practical benefits are noted, yet other factors influence my final purchasing behavior more decisively.
