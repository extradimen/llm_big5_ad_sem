**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Ad:**
   - *Like*: Neutral (3). The ad's message feels relevant but doesn't strongly engage me.
   - *Interesting*: Agree (4). It does catch my attention by addressing potential fatigue and dullness, which are relatable issues for a student.
   - *Good*: Strongly Agree (5). The ad effectively communicates the productâ€™s benefit in preventing tiredness and improving appearance.
   - *Attractive*: Neutral (3). While I acknowledge its good points, it doesn't have an irresistible pull.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend to Purchase*: Disagree (2). Though convinced of the benefits, my current budget constraints might prevent a purchase decision right away.
   - *Try to Buy*: Agree (4). The idea appeals enough for me to consider buying it if circumstances permit in the future.
   - *Consider Buying*: Strongly Agree (5). The ad makes me seriously think about trying out this product when financially feasible.

Overall, while I appreciate and find value in what the ad presents, my immediate purchase intent is limited by financial considerations. However, there's a strong consideration for the future.
