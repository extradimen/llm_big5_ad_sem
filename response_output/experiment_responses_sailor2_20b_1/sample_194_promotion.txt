**Evaluation:**

1. **Ad Attitudes:**
   - *Like (score = 5):* The ad's promise of energy and a good appearance is appealing but doesn't evoke strong enthusiasm.
   - *Interesting (score = 4):* It’s mildly intriguing as it highlights practical benefits, though not groundbreaking for the product category.
   - *Good (score = 6):* I find it well-crafted with clear messaging; however, there's room to improve on uniqueness and depth.
   - *Attractive (score = 3):* Lacks emotional pull due to neutral presentation—more personality could make it more engaging.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend (score = 2):* Not strong intent; while the benefits are clear, other factors like price and convenience influence purchasing decisions.
   - *Try (score = 3):* I might give it a chance if offered during sales or promotions but won't seek out immediately.
   - *Consider (score = 4):* The ad raises awareness enough to consider trying once, especially for times when energy boost is needed.

Overall, the ad effectively communicates its core benefits but misses elements of emotional connection and strong differentiation. As a talkative, goal-oriented individual with an active lifestyle, there's mild interest, yet practical considerations take precedence over immediate purchase intent. Further enhancements in creativity could make it more compelling.
