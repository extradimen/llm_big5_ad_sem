### Evaluation and Justification:

**Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
1. **Like (5)**: While I appreciate its energetic tone, it doesn't strongly resonate with my daily priorities or lifestyle as a blue-collar worker focused on task completion rather than constant energy boosts.
2. **Interesting (4)**: The concept of staying energized and looking good is intriguing but not compelling enough given the limited appeal to my specific needs.
3. **Good (3)**: The message seems generic, lacking personalized value for someone like me who prioritizes reliability over superficial benefits.
4. **Attractive (2)**: I'm strongly disinclined by this ad due to its focus on aesthetics and energy levels, which don't align with my work-centric needs or personal values.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **Intend (2)**: While the product might be useful, it's not high-priority; thus, I have no strong intention to buy.
2. **Try (3)**: If presented at a reasonable price point and during periods of extra fatigue, I may consider giving it a try.
3. **Consider (4)**: Given its potential benefits, I am somewhat open to purchasing but would need further reassurance or incentives.

Overall, while the ad's messaging is not strongly persuasive for me personally due to my values and lifestyle, there remains some consideration based on practical utility and personal health management needs.
