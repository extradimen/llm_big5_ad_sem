**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**  
  - *Like (score = 2):* Dislike; given my reserved and introverted nature, I find such an attention-grabbing claim unappealing.
  - *Interesting (score = 3):* Mildly interesting but not engaging. The fear of looking tired doesn't resonate with me as a core concern.
  - *Good (score = 4):* Neutral; the ad's message is somewhat valid, but it feels more manipulative than genuinely helpful.
  - *Attractive (score = 1):* Strongly disagree; it lacks credibility and attractiveness for someone like me who prioritizes practicality over appearance.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *Intend to purchase:* 1 (Strongly Disagree); Despite understanding the product’s potential benefits, my low interest in its presentation significantly reduces my intention.
  - *Try to buy this product:* 1 (Strongly Disagree); No compelling reason exists for me to make a trial purchase based on this advertisement.
  - *Consider buying this product:* 1 (Strongly Disagree); The ad doesn’t align with my values or lifestyle, making it highly unlikely I will consider purchasing.

Overall, the ad does not connect effectively with someone like myself due to its manipulative tone and focus on appearance over practicality. Consequently, purchase intention is very low despite acknowledging its potential utility.
