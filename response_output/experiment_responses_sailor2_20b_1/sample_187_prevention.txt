**Explanation:**

- **Attitudinal Scores (Ad Evaluation):**
    - **I like the ad:** Agree but not strongly (`4`), as it resonates with a bit of skepticism regarding such claims.
    - **Interesting:** Mildly interesting due to its straightforward messaging (`3`).
    - **Good Ad:** Viewed neutrally, lacking strong credibility or persuasive power (`2`). 
    - **Attractive:** Not particularly attractive given the somewhat negative self-image it invokes (`1`).

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    - **Intend to Purchase:** Mild intent due to practical concerns about fatigue and appearance but not a high priority (`2`).
    - **Try to Buy:** Open to trying, influenced by some personal need for energy enhancement (`2`).
    - **Consider Buying:** Willingly consider the product given its perceived relevance to daily life despite reservations (`3`).

Overall, while the ad isn't compelling or attractive enough on a strong emotional level (given my reserved and slightly skeptical nature), it does address practical concerns I face as an active blue-collar worker. Thus, there's moderate consideration for potential purchase but not immediate intent.
