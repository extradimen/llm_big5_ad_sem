**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement

1. **I like the ad (Score: 3)**:
   - Neutral to slightly positive because it aims at energy boost and better appearance, but personal taste in ads is mild.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)**:
   - Somewhat agree; the concept of staying energized resonates with everyday life challenges.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5)**:
   - Agree to some extent, as it promotes well-being and attractiveness, appealing in principle.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)**:
   - Neutral leaning towards slightly negative; visuals or tone might not grab immediate attention.

### Purchase Intention

1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)**:
   - Strongly disagree due to financial constraints and skepticism about effectiveness within budget limits.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 3)**:
   - Neutral; might consider a small trial if it's affordable but not committing fully.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 2)**:
   - Slightly negative; the ad is compelling, yet practical concerns outweigh potential benefits given my current financial situation and worries about sustainability of costs.

In summary, while I appreciate the message conveyed in the advertisement, my personal attributes (e.g., budget constraints, cautious nature) lead me to be less inclined towards purchasing. The attractiveness and belief scores reflect moderate interest but not enough to turn into a purchase intention under these circumstances.
