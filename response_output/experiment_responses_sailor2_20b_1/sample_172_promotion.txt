**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - *Like*: Neutral (3) - As a reserved yet sociable civil servant, the ad appeals but doesn't create strong enthusiasm due to my more cautious nature and preference for thorough evaluation before agreeing with marketing claims.
  - *Interesting*: Agree (4) - The promise of energy and looking good resonates, drawing initial interest, especially in balancing work-life demands as a busy professional.
  - *Good*: Agree (5) - I perceive the message to be well-crafted, focusing on practical benefits that align with personal priorities; however, it doesn’t fully convince me yet.
  - *Attractive*: Disagree (2) – While engaging, there’s not enough emotional connection or strong branding appeal for immediate attraction.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend to Purchase*: Neutral (3) – Though considering the benefits, I need further information and assurance of quality before committing.
  - *Try to Buy*: Agree (4) – There is intent to give it a try based on its potential advantages for energy management and appearance.
  - *Consider Buying*: Agree (5) – The product aligns with my practical needs, making me seriously consider adding it after additional research or user feedback.

This balanced evaluation reflects both the ad's appeal and my cautious but open-minded approach toward health/energy drinks.
