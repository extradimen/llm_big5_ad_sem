**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Ad Attitudes**
   - **I like the ad**: Neutral (Score = 4) — While I appreciate its goal to promote well-being, it feels slightly overplayed without a unique selling proposition.
   - **I think the ad is interesting**: Agree (Score = 5) — The promise of energy and looking best resonates with daily needs but could be more engaging in execution.
   - **I believe the ad is good**: Neutral/Positive (Score = 6) — It has basic credibility, especially for health-conscious individuals like me, yet lacks standout features.
   - **I find the ad attractive**: Mildly Attractive (Score = 3) — The imagery and messaging are acceptable but not particularly compelling or memorable.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to purchase this product**: Neutral/Weak Intent (Score = 2) — Despite my general trust, I don’t see a strong enough reason to commit without more information.
   - **Will try to buy the product**: Low Trial Interest (Score = 3) — There is some curiosity but not driven enough for an immediate purchase.
   - **Will consider buying this product**: Moderate Consideration (Score = 4) — The idea aligns with my lifestyle goals, making it worth a future consideration once more details are explored.

Overall, while the ad hits key wellness notes and appeals to foundational values of self-care, its impact could be stronger. A well-rounded approach highlighting unique benefits or personal stories would likely boost engagement further. For now, I maintain moderate interest but am not convinced for an immediate purchase decision.
