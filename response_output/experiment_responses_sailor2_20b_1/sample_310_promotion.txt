**Evaluation and Explanation:**

1. **Like the Ad:** *2* (Neutral) - Given my personality traits, being reserved but generally agreeable doesn't strongly align with an energetic or image-focused message.
   
2. **Interesting:** *3* (Agree) - The promise of staying energized is appealing to a student like me who faces daily tasks and stress, making it somewhat engaging.

3. **Good Ad:** *4* (Strongly Agree) - Although not overly impressed by the ad's style, I appreciate its functional benefits that fit my lifestyle.
   
4. **Attractive:** *5* (Agree) - The visual appeal and messaging resonate with staying active and looking good, making it somewhat attractive.

**Purchase Intention:**

1. **Intend to Purchase:** *2* (Low interest) - While the idea is appealing, I prioritize practicality over immediate purchase.
   
2. **Try to Buy:** *3* (Mild curiosity) - There's a slight inclination to test if it improves my daily energy levels and appearance.

3. **Consider Buying:** *4* (Moderate intention) - After trying or seeing positive results from others, I might seriously consider adding it to my routine despite initial neutrality. 

In summary, while the ad is good and somewhat attractive, there isn't a strong immediate pull due to personal preference for practicality over flashy promises. A trial period followed by performance validation would likely influence future purchase decisions.
