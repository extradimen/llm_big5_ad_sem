**Explanation:**

**Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
1. **I like the ad:** *Score: 2 (Disagree)* - The ad feels more manipulative than helpful; it uses fear of tiredness and dull appearance to push its product.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** *Score: 3 (Neutral)* - It's not particularly engaging, but it does make you consider your fatigue levels.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** *Score: 4 (Disagree)* - The persuasive tactics are overly negative and less grounded in genuine product benefits.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** *Score: 1 (Strongly Disagree)* - Not appealing or trustworthy enough to capture my interest.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **Intend to purchase this product:** *Score: 1 (Strongly Disagree)* - I'm not persuaded, given its aggressive tone and lack of credible reassurance.
2. **Will try to buy the product:** *Score: 1 (Strongly Disagree)* - No compelling reason or personal need to act on the ad's message.
3. **Will consider buying this product:** *Score: 2 (Neutral)** â€“ While the issue it addresses is relevant, my overall negative impression of the ad makes me unlikely to seriously consider purchasing.

In summary, despite some acknowledgment that fatigue might be an issue, the advertisement fails to win over due to its manipulative nature and lack of trustworthiness. As a result, there's no strong intention to buy or even try this product based on this ad alone.
