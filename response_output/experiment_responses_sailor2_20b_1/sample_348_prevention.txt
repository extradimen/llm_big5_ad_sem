**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**  
   - I like the ad (Score 3): While it's not highly appealing, it connects with my need for energy and appearance.
   - Itâ€™s interesting (Score 4): The concept of feeling tired or dull is relatable but doesn't captivate me intensely.
   - Good advertisement (Score 5): It effectively conveys the product benefit, though it lacks strong emotional engagement.
   - Attractive (Score 2): For someone like me who tends to be more reserved and a bit cautious, the ad feels somewhat manipulative.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
   - I intend to purchase this product (Score 2): My practical side sees value in trying it out due to its promise but isn't driven enough by the ad alone.
   - Will try to buy this product (Score 3): Given my generally trusting nature, there's a mild inclination towards giving it a shot if presented elsewhere or with additional reassurance.
   - Consider buying this product (Score 3): Despite some reservations about the marketing tone, I remain open-minded and might consider after further research or positive experiences.

Overall, while the ad resonates somewhat due to its preventive message, my cautious nature and preference for thoroughness require more compelling evidence before making a purchase decision. Therefore, scores reflect moderate interest but guarded intention.
