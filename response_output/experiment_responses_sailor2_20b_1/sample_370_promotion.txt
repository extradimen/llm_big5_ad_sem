**Evaluation and Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores (1–7):**
   - **Like the Ad:** 4
     - My reserved nature means I appreciate straightforward messaging but find this slightly superficial.
   - **Interesting:** 5
     - It's engaging for someone who values being energized, though it lacks depth in how it delivers its promise.
   - **Believe:** 6
     - Given my strong trust and agreement with thoroughness, the claim seems believable despite needing more detail on effectiveness.
   - **Attractive:** 5
     - The attractiveness balances between sociability and practicality; I find it appealing but not overwhelmingly so.

- **Purchase Intention Scores (1–7):**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** 3
     - While the ad resonates, my budget constraints make me cautious. $25 million VND monthly income requires careful spending.
   - **Try to Buy:** 4
     - I'm open-minded and will give it a try if there are discounts or samples available, aligning with my sociable side seeking new experiences.
   - **Consider Buying:** 5
     - The product fits well within my daily needs for energy but consideration is influenced by cost-effectiveness and reviews from trusted sources.

Overall, the ad holds moderate appeal due to its clear messaging on staying energized and looking good. However, purchase decisions will be contingent upon affordability and further proof of efficacy. Thus, a balanced yet cautious approach reflects my personality traits and financial situation.
