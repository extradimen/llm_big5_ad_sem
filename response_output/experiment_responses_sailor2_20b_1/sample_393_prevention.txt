### Detailed Evaluation:

**Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
1. **Like:** The ad resonates with me as a blue-collar worker who values energy and appearance, but it's not my top priority, so "like" falls moderately at **5/7**.
2. **Interesting:** Given that I'm talkative and outgoing, the idea of feeling tired or looking dull is relatable; hence, I find it intriguing at **6/7**.
3. **Good:** While persuasive, there's a neutral to slight positive belief about its message (preventing fatigue), rated as **4/7**.
4. **Attractive:** The ad appeals moderately but not strongly due to my tendency towards practicality and emotional stability, scoring it at **4/7**.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **Intend:** Although I align with the ad's message, daily expenses limit urgency for immediate purchase; hence **3 (considering)**.
2. **Try:** The persuasive nature makes me open to trying if circumstances allowâ€”giving a **5** on willingness to try.
3. **Consider:** Given my helpful and imaginative traits, coupled with occasional nervousness/worry about energy levels, I have high intent to consider buying it over time at **6/7**.

Overall, while the ad is moderately effective in attracting attention and motivating consideration, actual purchase decisions will be influenced by other factors like budget management and necessity.
