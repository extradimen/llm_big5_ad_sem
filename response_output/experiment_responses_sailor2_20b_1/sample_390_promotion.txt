**Explanation:**

**Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (3) — While I appreciate its purpose of energizing and boosting appearance, it doesn't particularly excite me due to my reserved nature.
2. **Interesting:** Agree (4) — The concept is appealing for everyday use, especially in maintaining energy levels.
3. **Believe it's good:** Somewhat Neutral (5) — It seems credible enough but lacks strong emotional appeal or personal relevance.
4. **Attractive:** Slightly Disagree (2) — The messaging feels a bit generic and doesn't resonate deeply with my preferences.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **Intend to purchase:** Strongly Disagree (1) — Despite acknowledging the benefits, I’m not inclined to make an immediate buy.
2. **Try to buy:** Strongly Disagree (1) — My tendency towards carelessness and nervousness makes it less likely for me to actively seek out this product without compelling reasons.
3. **Consider buying:** Somewhat Agree (2) — While I won't dismiss the idea entirely, my cautious nature means I'll need more concrete benefits or personal circumstances before deciding.

Overall, while acknowledging its utility, the ad lacks sufficient emotional connection and strong personal relevance for a purchase decision at this point in time.
