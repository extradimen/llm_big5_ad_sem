**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **I like the ad (4)**: While I appreciate energy drinks, the ad doesn't strongly resonate with my outgoing nature. It's OK but not compelling.
  - **Interesting (5)**: The idea of staying energized and looking good appeals to a practical level, making it somewhat engaging.
  - **Good (6)**: Personally relevant as an active blue-collar worker needing energy, yet the broad appeal isn't enough for strong agreement.
  - **Attractive (3)**: I'm not drawn visually or emotionally by the presentation; feels generic.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **I intend to purchase this product (2)**: Neutral-to-low intention due to other priorities and skepticism about immediate benefits.
  - **Try to buy (1)**: Not inclined to try unless significantly discounted or recommended through trusted networks.
  - **Consider buying (3)**: Might consider it when needed, but not a top-of-mind purchase.

Overall, the ad aligns moderately with my needs but lacks emotional connection and immediate appeal for action. Therefore, I'm more neutral leaning slightly positive toward attitude yet reserved in intent to buy.
