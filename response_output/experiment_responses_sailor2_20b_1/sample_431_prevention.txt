**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - **Like:** The ad's claim feels exaggerated and not genuinely appealing, so I score it a **2 (Disagree)**.
  - **Interesting:** While neutral on novelty, there isn't enough intrigue or creativity to make me feel strongly interested; thus, a **3 (Neutral)**.
  - **Good:** Despite being informative about preventing tiredness and dull appearance, its messaging doesn’t resonate well given my personality traits. Hence, I slightly agree: **4 (Agree)**.
  - **Attractive:** Given my reserved nature and preference for thoroughness, the ad lacks persuasive power; therefore, it’s a strong **1 (Strongly Disagree)**.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to Purchase:** The appeal is minimal due to over-promising and lack of connection with personal values—**1 (Strongly Disagree)**.
  - **Try to Buy:** No compelling reason coupled with my careful nature means I wouldn't actively seek this product; hence, another **1 (Strongly Disagree)**.
  - **Consider Buying:** Even though it addresses a potential issue, the ad's presentation doesn’t motivate me enough for consideration—**2 (Disagree)**.

Overall, while recognizing its preventive value, my personality traits and critical evaluation lead to low scores reflecting a lack of interest or intent towards purchasing.
