**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes (Scores):**
    - **I like the ad:** *2* (Neutral/Disagree)
        - As a talkative individual who prefers clarity and thoroughness but tends to worry easily, I appreciate straightforward messaging. However, this ad feels overly dramatic.
    - **Interesting:** *3* (Slightly Agree) 
        - The claim catches my attention due to its direct warning about tiredness and dull appearance, making it moderately interesting.
    - **Good:** *4* (Agree)
        - While not perfect, the message is clear enough. Given my tendency towards thorough work, I acknowledge it's well-constructed despite being somewhat overbearing.
    - **Attractive:** *3* (Neutral/Slightly Agree)
        - The ad design might catch me initially but doesn’t deeply engage or resonate due to perceived manipulation.

- **Purchase Intention:**
    - **Intend to purchase this product:** *1* (Strongly Disagree)
        - Despite the clear message, my tendency towards caution and worry leads me to question its necessity.
    - **Will try to buy this product:** *1* (Strongly Disagree) 
        - The ad’s urgency does not persuade me enough; I’d seek more evidence or reviews before trying it out.
    - **Consider buying this product:** *2* (Disagree)
        - While the idea isn’t rejected entirely, my general skepticism and emotional instability keep serious consideration at a minimum.

In summary, while the advertisement effectively communicates its purpose, it fails to convince me due to perceived manipulative tactics and personal tendencies towards caution and worry. Therefore, high purchase intention scores are not reached despite finding some aspects interesting or well-constructed.
