  - **I like the ad. (Score: 3)**: Neutral leaning towards positive but not overly enthusiastic due to personal care and health skepticism.
  - **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 4)**: Slightly interested, given its claim on energy and appearance improvement aligns with some lifestyle goals.
  - **I believe the ad is good. (Score: 5)**: Generally agreeable but not highly convinced by the universal appeal of a generic health beverage.
  - **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 2)**: Less appealing, particularly due to my tendency towards realism and skepticism about quick fixes.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product. (Score: 3)**: Neutral with slight lean toward consideration; aware of health benefits but not compelled enough for immediate action.
  - **Will try to buy this product. (Score: 3)**: Open-minded, willing to give it a chance if the opportunity arises or thereâ€™s further convincing evidence.
  - **Will consider buying this product. (Score: 3)**: Reflective of balanced thinking; considering purchase but not strongly driven by current ad.
