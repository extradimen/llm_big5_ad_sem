**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
  - **I like the ad. (Score: 2)**: While I value energy and appearance, this generic statement doesn’t resonate personally due to my strong caring nature; it feels superficial.
  - **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 3)**: Neutral-to-mildly interested—enough attention-grabbing elements but nothing particularly compelling given my personality traits.
  - **I believe the ad is good. (Score: 4)**: It’s okay, but lacking in trustworthiness and detail for someone who tends to be wary of promises about quick fixes.
  - **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 1)**: Strongly disagree; my reserved nature finds it unappealing with a focus on external appearance rather than intrinsic value.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product. (Score: 1)**: No intention, as the messaging doesn’t align with my thoughtful and careful approach.
  - **Will try to buy this product. (Score: 1)**: Not likely given my tendency towards thoroughness and reluctance to make impulsive decisions.
  - **Will consider buying it. (Score: 1)**: Minimal consideration; I value more concrete benefits over vague claims, especially considering the product's price range in VND.

Overall, while acknowledging its presence, this ad lacks personal appeal and practical relevance for me as a cautious civil servant with specific emotional and behavioral preferences.
