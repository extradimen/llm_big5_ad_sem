**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
  - **I like the ad (score = 4):** Neutral-leaning towards liking; while energizing drinks can be appealing for daily routines, it doesn't particularly stand out to me.
  - **Interesting (5):** The promise of staying energized and looking good is intriguing but not groundbreaking enough to captivate my interest fully.
  - **Believe the ad is good (6):** I find the message credible; energy drinks often align with these claims, making it believable within context.
  - **Attractive (3):** While the idea is sound, there's a lack of personal appeal or unique features that make it stand out among similar products.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase (2):** Slightly neutral but leaning towards not intending; I may use energizing drinks occasionally, but this ad alone isn't enough to drive an immediate buy.
  - **Try to buy (3):** Neutral with a slight positive tilt; might consider trying it if available in my local market or during sales promotions.
  - **Consider buying (4):** Slightly agree; the product fits well within my lifestyle, making it worth considering when planning my next purchase.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad's message and credibility, personal appeal is somewhat lacking. Therefore, a moderate intention to buy but not a strong commitment.
