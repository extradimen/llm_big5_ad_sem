**Evaluation and Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **I like the ad:** 6 (Strongly Agree)
     Given my talkative and outgoing nature, I appreciate an energetic product that aligns with a youthful lifestyle.
   - **I think the ad is interesting:** 5 (Agree)
     The promise of staying energized resonates with daily college life stressors. However, it lacks novelty to entice me fully.
   - **I believe the ad is good:** 4 (Neutral)
     While effective in messaging, there's a neutral tone due to mixed feelings on health claims and marketing clichés.
   - **I find the ad attractive:** 3 (Disagree)
     Although visually appealing, it doesn't captivate me deeply because of my skepticism about quick fixes.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **I intend to purchase this product:** 2 (Strongly Disagree)
     Despite liking aspects of the advertisement, the high price range compared to my budget limits immediate intent.
   - **I will try to buy this product:** 2 (Strongly Disagree)
     Given economic constraints and lack of compelling evidence beyond marketing hype, trying it feels impractical.
   - **I will consider buying this product:** 3 (Neutral)
     While not currently prioritized, the idea may be revisited if I see consistent positive feedback from peers or discounts.

Overall, while the ad appeals to my social energy needs and interests, practical considerations like budget and skepticism about efficacy dampen strong purchase intentions. It leaves room for future consideration but doesn’t push me into immediate action.
