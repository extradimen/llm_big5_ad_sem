Okay, here's my evaluation of the ComfyNest ergonomic chair advertisement, presented in the requested JSON format, reflecting my demographic profile and personality traits. As a single, moderately-earning civil servant with a postgraduate degree, I value thoroughness and comfort but can also be a little careless and quite talkative. I also have a very active imagination, which informs my responses.

```json
{
  "ad_type": "furniture",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 1, 2, 2],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

**Explanation of Scores:**

*   **Like (3):** I don't *dislike* the ad, but it doesn’t particularly excite me. "ComfyNest" evokes a sense of security, which I appreciate, but it’s not overwhelmingly positive.
*   **Interesting (1):** The ad isn't particularly inventive or captivating. It’s a straightforward presentation of features. I am easily distracted by novel concepts.
*   **Good (2):** It's functional, conveying basic information about the chair. But "good" feels like a very low bar.
*   **Attractive (2):** The ad likely includes a photo of a comfortable-looking chair, which is fine, but it isn't aesthetically striking or particularly appealing. As a person with an active imagination, I'm looking for something more engaging visually.

*   **Intend (1):** My income bracket is a significant factor. While I value comfort and work from home regularly, I’m budget-conscious and this chair likely sits in a price range that requires justification.
*   **Try (2):** I might look up reviews or compare it to other options if I was actively looking for a new chair.
*   **Consider (4):** The adjustable lumbar support and breathable mesh are genuinely appealing features, particularly given my posture-related issues from working at a desk. It’s a practical improvement, so I'm open to thinking about it seriously if the price is reasonable.
