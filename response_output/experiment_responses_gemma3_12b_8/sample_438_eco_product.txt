Okay, here's my evaluation of the GreenCare laundry detergent advertisement, presented in the requested JSON format, reflecting my demographic profile and personality traits. I’m going to be honest and critical, keeping in mind my values and tendencies.

```json
{
  "ad_type": "eco_product",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 1, 2, 1],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [2, 2, 3]
}
```

**Explanation of Scores:**

*   **Like (3):** I'm not *unhappy* with the ad. The idea of a plant-based detergent is appealing, but it's a common message now. My age and background mean I'm generally open to things that seem beneficial.
*   **Interesting (1):** The ad isn't particularly groundbreaking or memorable. It presents a familiar environmental message. I'm not easily impressed. I tend to be careless and quickly forget things, so an ad needs to really grab my attention.
*   **Good (2):** It’s *okay*. It’s fulfilling a standard, but not exceeding expectations. I tend to worry a lot, and part of that is a skepticism toward marketing claims. I need more than a simple statement to believe it's genuinely good.
*   **Attractive (1):** Visually, it’s likely fine, but doesn’t stand out. My personality is not easily charmed. I am also not very artistic, so I wouldn’t be drawn to artistic or creative advertising.

**Purchase Intention:**

*   **Intend (2):** I don’t strongly intend to purchase it, but I'm not completely opposed to the idea. My tendency to be helpful and unselfish means I *would* like to support eco-friendly options, but I'm also cost-conscious (living with parents).
*   **Try (2):** I might try it once, especially if it’s on sale or a friend recommends it. My tendency to be careless means I’d likely grab the first thing I see at the store anyway.
*   **Consider (3):** I will likely consider buying it at some point, especially if I'm already buying other laundry products. My planned, follow-through personality means I’m likely to evaluate options before purchasing something new.
