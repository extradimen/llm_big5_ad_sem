 As an ideal consumer with my unique demographic profile and personality traits, I would rate the ad as follows:

**Ad type: Prevention**

**Attitude scores**:
1. Like - Strongly Disagree, 1/7
2. Interesting - Neutral, 3/7
3. Good - Agree, 5/7
4. Attractive - Disagree, 4/7

My attitude toward the advertisement is neutral to negative. Although I find it interesting and believe that it is good, I do not like or find it attractive. I may be biased against this product because of my demographic profile as a civil servant with a high school education in a rural area. Furthermore, I am reserved and tend to be careless, which makes me less likely to trust the ad or be persuaded by it.

**Purchase intention scores**:
1. Intend - Strongly Disagree, 1/7
2. Try - Neutral, 3/7
3. Consider - Agree, 5/7

My purchase intention is neutral to positive. Although I may consider buying the product due to its goodness and interest factor, I do not intend or plan to buy it. My low income level, limited access to credit, and lack of trust in the ad make me less likely to make a purchase decision. Additionally, as a single woman with a conservative marital status, I may not have a need for this drink.

Overall, while I find some aspects of the advertisement interesting and good, my negative attitude and low purchase intention score indicate that it is unlikely that I would buy the product.
