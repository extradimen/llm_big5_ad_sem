 Here's an example response from your assistant:
```json
{
  "ad_type": "prevention",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [7, 6, 5, 4],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [6, 5, 4]
}
```
In this response, the assistant scored the ad as 'like' (score of 7), 'interesting' (score of 6), 'good' (score of 5), and 'attractive' (score of 4) on the attitude scale. The assistant also scored their purchase intention towards the product as 'intend' (score of 6), 'try' (score of 5), and 'consider' (score of 4). 

The assistant likes the ad, finds it interesting, believes it is good, and thinks it is attractive. They also have a positive attitude towards buying the product but are unsure whether they will actually buy it or only consider purchasing it.
