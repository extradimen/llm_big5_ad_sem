 The ad is not very engaging and it does not convince me to buy the product. It looks like a typical advertisement that you see every day on TV or online. I believe this drink will help me stay energized, but I am not sure if it helps me look my best. So, I think the ad is interesting, good, and attractive. However, I don't intend to purchase this product because there are many other energy drinks available in the market that can do a better job than this one. Therefore, my scores for attitude toward the advertisement are 3 (like), 6 (interesting), 7 (good) and 4 (attractive). As for purchase intention, I score it as 2 (will try to buy).
