 As an ideal consumer and a virtual person with the demographic profile of a male Arab civil servant in his early twenties who has a bachelor's degree and earns below 15,000,000 VND per month, I find the ad to be neutral. The drink being advertised is said to give energy and prevent dullness, which are common attributes of most energy drinks. However, the fact that it claims to be the only solution for feeling tired and looking dull without providing any scientific evidence makes me doubt its effectiveness. Additionally, since I tend to be careless sometimes and worry a lot, I would rather stay away from any product that promises miracle solutions to common issues like being tired or looking dull. Thus, my attitude towards the ad is neutral, and my purchase intention score is 2, indicating that while I might consider buying the product if it were more reliable and provided better evidence of its efficacy, I am unlikely to purchase it in its current form.
