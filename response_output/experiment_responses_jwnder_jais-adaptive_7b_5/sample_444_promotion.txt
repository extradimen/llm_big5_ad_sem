 Here is a sample response to the given prompt:

```json
{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": {
    "like": 1,
    "interesting": 2,
    "good": 3,
    "attractive": 4
  },
  "purchase_intention_scores": {
    "intend": 5,
    "try": 6,
    "consider": 7
  }
}
```

This is a sample response to the prompt. The user believes that the ad for the drink is interesting, good, and attractive but does not necessarily intend to purchase it as they are already satisfied with their current energy levels and do not have any interest in trying out a new drink. However, if the price of the drink were significantly lower or if there was an offer on it, then the user may consider buying it.
