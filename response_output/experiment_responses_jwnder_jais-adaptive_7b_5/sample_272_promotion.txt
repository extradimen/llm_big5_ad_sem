 The ad seems to be promoting a drink that helps you stay energized and look your best every day. I think the ad is interesting because it mentions something I need in my daily routine: energy and looking good. I believe the ad is good because it promises to help me achieve those two goals. However, I find the ad attractive only slightly because it doesn't seem very unique or different from other energy drinks on the market.

I intend to purchase this product if it lives up to its promise and works as advertised. I will try to buy this product because I am curious about how it will affect me, but I might be skeptical initially. I will consider buying this product after trying it out and seeing if it helps me achieve my goals.

So my scores are 6 for ad type, 5 for attitude toward the advertisement, 7 for purchase intention.
