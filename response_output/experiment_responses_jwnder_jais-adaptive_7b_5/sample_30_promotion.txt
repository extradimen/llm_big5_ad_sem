 Here's an example of how you might format the answer based on your personality traits:
```json
{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [5, 4, 6, 7],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [3, 2, 4]
}
```
In this example, I like the ad (score = 5), think it's interesting (score = 4), and find it attractive (score = 6). However, my purchase intention is more neutral (scores of 3 for intending to buy, 2 for trying to buy, and 4 for considering buying).
