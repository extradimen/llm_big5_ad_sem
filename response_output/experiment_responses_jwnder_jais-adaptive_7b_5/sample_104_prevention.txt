 Here's an example of how the output should be formatted according to the instructions:

```
{
  "ad_type": "prevention",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [7, 6, 5, 4],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [3, 2, 1]
}
```
In this example, the score of 7 means that the assistant strongly agrees with the ad being interesting. The scores 6 and 5 represent moderate agreement and disagreement, respectively. The scores 4 and below mean that the assistant does not agree or has a negative opinion about the ad. Similarly, the scores 3, 2, and 1 indicate that the assistant is unsure, neither agreeing nor disagreeing with the ad, while scores of 0 and below show strong disagreement or dislike towards the ad.

Note: The actual output will vary depending on the responses given by the assistant.
