 Here is the output for your question:

```json
{
  "ad_type": "prevention",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [7,6.5,6,5],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [6,5.5,4]
}
```

Your output format is correct and following the instructions given in the prompt, but please note that it does not provide any useful information about whether the ad resonates with you or not. You need to fill out each score for attitude towards the advertisement and purchase intention separately, using a scale from 1 to 7 where 1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree.
