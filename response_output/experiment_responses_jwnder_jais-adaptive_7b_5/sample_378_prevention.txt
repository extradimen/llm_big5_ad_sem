  The ad is quite manipulative and doesn't appeal to me as a person. The product being advertised seems too good to be true and I don't trust the claims made in it. In addition, I feel that it doesn't provide any real benefit or value for me as an individual.

Overall, my attitude towards this ad is negative, which reflects in my purchase intention scores. I do not intend to buy this product nor will I try to purchase it or even consider buying it. Therefore, the JSON output for this advertisement would be: 

{
  "ad_type": "prevention",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [1,2,3,4],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1,1,1]
}
