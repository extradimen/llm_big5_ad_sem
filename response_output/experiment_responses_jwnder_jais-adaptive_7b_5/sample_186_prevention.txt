 The advertisement is about a drink that claims to help people feel less tired and look better. As someone who tends to be careless sometimes, I find the ad's claim of reducing fatigue quite appealing. However, I am not sure if it is realistic or whether the product will work as claimed. Overall, I believe this ad is good but not enough to convince me to buy the product immediately. Therefore, my scores would be 2, 4, and 3 for attitude towards the advertisement, purchase intention, respectively.
