 The question is about an advertisement for a drink that helps you feel less tired and look more vibrant. As someone who is 60 years old, married, has a postgraduate degree, and earns a monthly income of over VND 36 million ($1626), I would give the following scores based on my personality traits:

First, my attitude toward the advertisement:
- I like the ad. (Strongly agree)
- I think the ad is interesting. (Neutral)
- I believe the ad is good. (Agree)
- I find the ad attractive. (Agree)

Second, my purchase intention:
- I intend to purchase this product. (Disagree)
- I will try to buy this product. (Strongly disagree)
- I will consider buying this product. (Neutral)

My answer is based on the fact that I am already healthy and energetic, so there's no need for me to consume a drink to improve my physical condition or appearance. Also, even if the ad was persuasive, it wouldn't make me want to buy this product because it does not match with my values and personality traits. Therefore, I would rate the advertisement as neutral overall.
