 As an AI model, I don't have personal feelings or experiences. However, based on the provided demographic and personality traits of the virtual person, here is a hypothetical evaluation of the advertisement:

First, your **attitude toward the advertisement**:
1. I like the ad.
2. I think the ad is interesting.
3. I believe the ad is good.
4. I find the ad attractive. - Score 1 (Strongly Disagree), 2 (Disagree), 3 (Agree), 4 (Agree) respectively.

Second, your **purchase intention**:
1. I intend to purchase this product. - This score depends on the specifics of the product and how well it addresses the advertised need or desire. If it is a commodity product, the score may be low. If it offers unique benefits that align with the consumer's needs, the score could be high.
2. I will try to buy this product. - As above, this depends on the specifics of the product and its appeal to the consumer's needs or desires.
3. I will consider buying this product. - Again, this depends on the specifics of the product and how well it addresses the consumer's needs or desires. If the ad is effective, the score could be high. If not, the score may be low.

Here's a hypothetical response in JSON format:
{ 
  "ad_type": "prevention", 
  "ad_attitude_scores": [1,2,3,4], 
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1,2,3]
