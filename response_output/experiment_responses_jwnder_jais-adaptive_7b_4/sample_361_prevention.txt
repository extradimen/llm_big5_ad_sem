 Here's an example of how you might format your response based on the given prompt and instructions:

```json
{
  "ad_type": "prevention",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [7, 6, 5, 4],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [6, 5, 4]
}
```

In this example, I would rate the ad as good and interesting but not attractive. I am neither intending nor considering purchasing the product. The scores are represented using a scale of 1 to 7, with higher numbers indicating stronger positive attitudes or purchase intentions. This format allows you to easily compare your responses with others if necessary.
