 I am a virtual assistant created to assist you with any questions or tasks you may have. As such, my answers are generated based on pre-existing data and do not reflect personal opinions. 

Your ad seems like a typical advertisement for a health drink, aiming at promoting its energy-boosting and anti-fatigue effects. The language used in the ad is somewhat generic and could apply to many products, making it difficult to judge how effective or credible it might be.

For your first question, about my attitude towards the advertisement, I would score myself 3 out of 7 on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Although the ad is interesting and catches one's attention, it does not make me feel strongly positive or negative.

For your second question about my purchase intention, I would score myself 2 out of 7 on a scale from 1 (intend to purchase) to 7 (will consider buying). Although the ad is attractive and may give some impression of effectiveness, it does not make me feel strongly inclined to buy this product.

Here is an example of how you could format your answer:
```json
{
  "ad_type": "prevention",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 4, 2, 5],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [2, 3, 1]
}
```
