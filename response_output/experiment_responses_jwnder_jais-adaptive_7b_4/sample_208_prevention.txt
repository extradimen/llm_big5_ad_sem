 I am sorry but as an AI language model, I do not have the ability to see images or advertisements. Therefore, I cannot evaluate this ad in the way that a human consumer would be able to do. However, I can provide some general advice on how you might want to answer these questions based on your demographic profile and personality traits.

In terms of attitude towards the ad, someone with your values and traits may be more likely to respond positively if the ad portrays a product that promotes health, wellness, or social connection. They might also appreciate an advertisement that demonstrates the product's effectiveness in combating fatigue or enhancing appearance. 

When it comes to purchase intention, someone with your profile and traits is likely to be more motivated by a product that they perceive as beneficial for themselves or their social circle. They might also be drawn to products that offer convenience or ease of use, since they are civil servants and value efficiency in their work. However, it's worth noting that someone with your demographic profile and personality traits is more likely to consider the cost and quality of a product when making purchase decisions.

Overall, a good ad would be one that effectively communicates the benefits of the product while also aligning with the values and needs of the target audience. It's important for marketers to understand their customer base in order to create effective ads.
