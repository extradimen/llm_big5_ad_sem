 The ad is about a drink that helps prevent tiredness and dullness. I believe the ad is well-designed and interesting because it shows a before and after picture of a person who looks less dull after drinking the product. The ad also tells me how to feel better, which appeals to my emotional side since I am someone who worries a lot and gets nervous easily. However, as an honest assistant, I must admit that the ad does not fully convince me to buy the product because there is no explanation about what ingredients are in this drink or how long it takes for me to feel better. So my final score for the ad's effectiveness would be 4 out of 7.

I am an active person who likes to stay healthy and fit, so I would consider buying this product if I knew more about its benefits. Therefore, my scores for purchase intention are 3 (consider) and 2 (try). However, as an honest assistant, I must add that since there is no information on what ingredients or nutrients are in this drink, I might feel worried about its safety if it contains artificial or harmful chemicals. So my final score for purchase intention would be 3 out of 7.

In summary, while I like the ad and find it interesting because it shows before and after pictures, I am not sure whether to buy this product due to lack of information about its contents. Therefore, my final score for attitude toward the advertisement is 4 out of 7, and purchase intention is 3 out of 7.
