 The advertisement is not something that resonates with me. It seems to be trying too hard to convince me of the product's benefits and makes me feel uncomfortable. I would not like this drink if it was real, and I don't think that I will ever consider buying it. The ad does not seem believable at all and is quite manipulative. 1, 2, 3, 4
