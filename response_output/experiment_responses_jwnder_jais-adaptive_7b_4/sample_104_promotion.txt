 The ad is not persuasive or appealing to me because it doesn't provide any information about the product itself. I am also concerned that drinking energy drinks can have negative effects on my health. Therefore, my attitude towards this ad would be 1 (strongly disagree) and my purchase intention would be 3 (consider buying).
