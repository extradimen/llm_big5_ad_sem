 Here's a sample response from the AI:
```json
{
  "ad_type": "prevention",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [5],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [6]
}
```
In this response, the AI gives a score of 1 for "like" and 2 for "interesting", indicating that it finds the ad to be unappealing. It also scores 3 for both "good" and "attractive", indicating that it thinks the ad is good but also not very attractive, which may be due to its low score for "like". The AI scores a 4 for both "intend" and "try", indicating that although it finds the ad to be good and interesting, it doesn't feel strongly enough about it to intend or try buying it. Overall, the AI seems somewhat ambivalent towards the ad, suggesting that it may not be very effective at persuading potential customers.
