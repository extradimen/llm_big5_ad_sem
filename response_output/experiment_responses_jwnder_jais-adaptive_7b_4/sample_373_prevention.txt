 I don't know the product, but this ad is not very convincing. It seems a bit vague and doesn't really tell me what it is that makes the drink special.\nI don't think I'd like to buy it based on this ad alone. So my attitude toward the advertisement is 3 (find it attractive).\nSince I have no intention of buying the product at all, my purchase intention score is 1 (do not intend to purchase this product).
