 The advertisement is very persuasive and effective. It makes the viewer feel tired and dull without the product being used, which gives me an impression that it's a very powerful drink. Therefore, I like the ad because it is interesting and good in conveying its message clearly. I find myself attracted to this type of ad since it makes me want to buy something new. So my attitude towards this advertisement can be scored as 7 for both "like" and "interesting".

On the other hand, there's no information about what is actually inside this drink apart from its ability to make you feel better after a long day or week. Also, it claims that without this product you will feel tired and look dull which makes me suspicious because wearing clothes can affect how people see themselves but having no energy doesn't necessarily mean they are dull-looking. Therefore my purchase intention scores for each option are 1 since I do not intend to purchase such an unknown product even though I think it is interesting or good because of its effectiveness at persuading me that without this drink I am tired and look dull.

Overall, while I agree with most points in this ad (such as getting a good rest), there are some things which do not make sense to me such as wearing clothes being able to affect how people see themselves or looking dull after having no energy. Therefore my overall score for this ad would be 3 out of 7 because while I find it interesting and agree with many points made in the advertisement, there are still some unclear things about what exactly happens when consuming their product.
