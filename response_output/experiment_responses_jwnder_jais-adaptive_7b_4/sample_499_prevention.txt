 The ad is not very informative or persuasive. It doesn't tell me much about the product, and I don't think it would make me want to buy the drink even if I was interested in energy drinks. So I wouldn't score this ad as strongly as I might for an advertisement that included more specific information about what was in the product or how it could help you feel better. The ad is also very simplistic, which makes it seem less credible to me than if there had been more details provided on why I should believe that drinking this beverage would make me look and feel better. Overall, I think this is a poorly executed ad with little value or appeal for potential customers like myself.
