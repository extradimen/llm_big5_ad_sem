 Here's a sample response:
```json
{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [7, 6, 5, 4],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [4, 3, 2]
}
```
This would indicate that the user liked the ad and found it interesting, but did not think it was good or attractive. They were neutral about purchasing the product, intending to try it but not necessarily buying it.
