 The ad is not very appealing to me. It seems like a typical advertisement for a drink that claims to provide energy and help you feel more awake. I don't find the ad particularly interesting or good because it doesn't offer anything new or unique. In addition, there are so many similar products in the market already that it feels like just another one of them. The ad also seems dishonest since it claims to provide energy without explaining how exactly this is achieved.

In terms of purchase intention, I don't intend to buy this product at all. Even if the drink actually worked as advertised, I wouldn't be interested in spending money on something like that. It just doesn't seem worth it when there are better alternatives available with more positive reviews and fewer negative side effects.
