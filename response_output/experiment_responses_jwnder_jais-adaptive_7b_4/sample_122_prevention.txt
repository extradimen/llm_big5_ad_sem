 The ad is not appealing to me. I believe that it tries to manipulate people into thinking that without the drink they will feel tired and look dull. Additionally, I am not convinced by the claim that the drink can help prevent feeling tired or looking dull. Therefore, my attitude towards the advertisement is negative, and my purchase intention scores are low:

```json
{ 
    "ad_type": "prevention",
    "ad_attitude_scores": [1,2,3,4],
    "purchase_intention_scores": [1,2,3]
}
```
