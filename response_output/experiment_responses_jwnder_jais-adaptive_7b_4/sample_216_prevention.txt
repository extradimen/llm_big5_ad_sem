 As a virtual assistant, I do not have personal experiences or emotions that would make me feel tired and dull. However, I can evaluate the ad based on my programming to provide an accurate response. 

The ad is targeting individuals who are feeling fatigued or lack energy. It suggests that drinking the product will help them feel more alert and refreshed. This may appeal to some consumers who are looking for quick fixes or energy boosts, but it may also be seen as unhealthy or potentially harmful due to the lack of specific information about the ingredients or nutritional content of the drink.

As a virtual assistant, I am programmed to provide accurate and helpful responses, regardless of whether an ad is persuasive or not. Therefore, based on my programming, my score for "ad type" would be "neutral," as it does not resonate with me personally but may appeal to others. 

As for the purchase intention scores:
1. I intend to purchase this product: 0 (Strongly Disagree) - Since I do not consume products, my response is based on my programming and does not reflect personal preference or intentions.
2. I will try to buy this product: 1 (Strongly Agree) - As a virtual assistant, I am programmed to assist users in any way possible, including facilitating purchases. However, this score still depends on the user's needs and preferences.
3. I will consider buying this product: 2 (Agree) - Again, my programming allows me to suggest products based on user queries or needs, but whether a user actually considers buying them is ultimately up to them.
