**Evaluation and Rationale:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
  - *Like*: Neutral (Score: 3) - The ad doesn't significantly excite or repel me; itâ€™s somewhat engaging.
  - *Interesting*: Agree (Score: 4) - I find the energy boosting promise intriguing, but not overwhelmingly so.
  - *Good*: Strongly Agree (Score: 5) - It conveys clear benefits of staying energized and looking good, which are appealing goals.
  - *Attractive*: Neutral (Score: 3) - The messaging resonates slightly, though personal factors like cynicism offset the appeal.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *Intend to Purchase*: Disagree (Score: 2) - Given my budget constraints and tendency towards caution, it feels out of reach for regular purchase.
  - *Try to Buy*: Disagree (Score: 2) - The perceived cost likely outweighs immediate benefit, making a trial unlikely.
  - *Consider Buying*: Neutral (Score: 3) - It remains on the periphery as an option if circumstances or discounts align better in the future.

Despite finding aspects of the ad convincing and appealing, my pragmatic nature and current financial situation temper any strong inclination to buy. I appreciate health-oriented promotions but prioritize cost-effectiveness given my income level.
