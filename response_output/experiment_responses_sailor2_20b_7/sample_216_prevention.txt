**Explanation:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad:** 2 - While it's targeted and somewhat relevant to potential physical discomfort (tiredness), I find it slightly manipulative in its messaging.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** 3 - The concept of preventing tiredness and dull appearance peaks curiosity, but not enough for strong engagement.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** 4 - It's well-crafted and clear about addressing common concerns, but doesn't strongly resonate with my preferences or values.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** 5 - The visual presentation could be appealing if executed tastefully; however, I lean towards a balanced approach in health-focused ads.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** 6 - Given my preference for thoroughness and following through on plans (especially when it comes to personal well-being), the ad does influence me positively.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** 7 - The preventive nature aligns with practicality, so I'm willing to give it a shot based on its promise.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** 7 - Emotional stability and concern for personal appearance make the consideration high; despite reservations about manipulation, the potential benefit is significant.

Overall, while the ad doesn't strike an immediate emotional chord due to my reserved nature, its clear message of prevention aligns with practicality and responsibility towards health. Thus, I am likely to give it serious thought before purchasing.
