**Evaluation Explanation:**

### **Ad Attitudes**
- **Like (Score = 6)**: While the ad's message about staying energized and looking good resonates with my desire for practical benefits, its presentation is somewhat generic.
- **Interesting (Score = 5)**: The concept appeals to me as it addresses everyday needs like energy and appearance enhancement. However, there isnâ€™t a unique or compelling hook that captivates attention strongly.
- **Good (Score = 4)**: I see value in the promise of the product but find the ad's tone slightly exaggerated; therefore, it doesn't come across as entirely credible.
- **Attractive (Score = 3)**: The visual appeal and aesthetics are decent but lack personal connection or creativity that would make me strongly attracted to it.

### **Purchase Intention**
- **Intend (Score = 2)**: Though I find the product appealing, my immediate intention isn't high due to competing priorities and budget considerations.
- **Try (Score = 1)**: Given my current financial situation (>46,000,000 VND/month), trying it seems unlikely unless there are significant discounts or compelling offers.
- **Consider (Score = 2)**: I will keep the product in mind but not actively seek out a purchase at this moment. The ad leaves an impression, encouraging future consideration with more favorable conditions.

This evaluation reflects my balanced perspective as someone who appreciates positive messaging yet is cautious about direct purchasing decisions due to lifestyle and personal preferences.
