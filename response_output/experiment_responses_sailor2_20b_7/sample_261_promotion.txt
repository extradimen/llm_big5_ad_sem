**Detailed Evaluation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
  - **I like the ad (3)**: Given my reserved nature and lack of enthusiasm for social or energetic products, I find this generic claim less appealing.
  - **I think the ad is interesting (2)**: The promise to stay energized resonates minimally; it doesn't grab my attention given my practical outlook.
  - **I believe the ad is good (3)**: Neutral as the claims seem somewhat general and unconvincing without specific evidence or relatability.
  - **I find the ad attractive (2)**: The overall presentation feels too surface-level, not aligning with my reserved preference for deeper information.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **I intend to purchase this product (1)**: Strongly disagree. My financial constraints and skepticism toward broad health claims make a full commitment unlikely.
  - **I will try to buy this product (2)**: Slightly higher than intention, but it's still low due to budget limitations and lack of urgency in my lifestyle.
  - **I will consider buying the product (1)**: Barely considering because the benefits do not align well with my reserved approach or daily needs.

Overall, while I appreciate acknowledging the importance of energy for health, this ad falls short in engaging me deeply, influencing my purchase intent significantly. The combination of skepticism and practical priorities keep these scores low.
