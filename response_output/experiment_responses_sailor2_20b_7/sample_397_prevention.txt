**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (score=6):** I find the concept appealing as it highlights potential negative outcomes without using the product.
   - **Interesting (score=5):** The ad's premise is engaging but not groundbreaking; still, it hooks into common concerns about energy and appearance.
   - **Good (score=4):** It effectively communicates a problem-solution scenario but lacks depth or novelty in execution.
   - **Attractive (score=3):** While somewhat attractive due to its straightforward message, it falls short on uniqueness given the saturated market of such products.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend (score=2):** I'm not strongly inclined to purchase just from seeing this ad; my decision would require more information.
   - **Try (score=3):** There's a moderate inclination to give it a try if the product comes recommended by friends or if I see tangible benefits in other user experiences.
   - **Consider (score=4):** The ad does prompt consideration, especially during times when I feel tired and need an energy boost. Itâ€™s on my radar but not yet a priority.

In summary, while I appreciate the straightforward messaging of the ad's "prevention" strategy, it lacks enough impact to drive immediate purchase intent but remains relevant for future consideration.
