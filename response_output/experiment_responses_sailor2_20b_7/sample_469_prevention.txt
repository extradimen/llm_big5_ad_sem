**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad**: **2 (Neutral)** - The straightforward message might not resonate deeply with my personality.
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: **3 (Slightly Agree)** - It has a clear call to action, but lacks emotional appeal or originality for me.
3. **I believe the ad is good**: **4 (Agree)** - Functionally effective in highlighting potential consequences of not using the product.
4. **I find the ad attractive**: **2 (Slightly Disagree)** - Its simplicity and directness don't align with my preference for more engaging or imaginative ads.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: **1 (Strongly Disagree)** - Given my reserved nature, I'm not inclined by the ad alone.
2. **I will try to buy this product**: **1 (Strongly Disagree)** - The lack of personal connection or urgency makes it less likely for me to make an effort.
3. **I will consider buying this product**: **2 (Neutral/Consideration)** - There's some acknowledgment that the benefits might be relevant, but not enough motivation on its own.

Overall, while I recognize the ad's potential functional value, my personal preferences and traits lead me to a low inclination towards purchasing without additional persuasive factors.
