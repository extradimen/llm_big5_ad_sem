**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - *Like (Score: 3)*: It's engaging but doesn't resonate deeply.
   - *Interesting (Score: 4)*: The energy and appearance claims are intriguing enough to keep attention.
   - *Good (Score: 5)*: While not perfect, the message is clear about benefits which aligns somewhat with my preference for practicality.
   - *Attractive (Score: 2)*: It lacks a strong emotional hook or personal appeal.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend to purchase (Score: 3)*: Neutral interest; might consider but not strongly driven by the ad alone.
   - *Will try to buy (Score: 3)*: Curiosity nudges me towards giving it a trial, especially if available and budget-friendly.
   - *Will consider buying (Score: 3)*: Overall, I find myself in this middle-ground; balanced between being persuaded enough to evaluate further but not fully sold by the ad.

In summary, while the advertisement sparks some interest due to its clear benefits for energy and appearance, it doesn't create a strong emotional connection or an immediate purchase drive. The scores reflect moderate engagement and intention, with room for other factors like personal experiences and reviews before making a final decision.
