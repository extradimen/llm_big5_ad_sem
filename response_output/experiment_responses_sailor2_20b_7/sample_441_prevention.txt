**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad:** (Score: 3) - Neutral. The appeal is moderate; it doesn’t excite but isn't off-putting either.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score: 4) - Slightly Agree. It manages to get attention with a clear message, but not exceptionally engaging.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score: 5) - Neutral leaning towards Agree. The messaging about energy and appearance feels somewhat credible but lacks emotional resonance for me personally.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score: 2) - Disagree. It's too straightforward and might feel manipulative, focusing heavily on negating negative states without a compelling narrative or personal connection.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score: 1) - Strongly Disagree. Given my financial constraints and skepticism about the ad’s claims, I have no intent to buy.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score: 2) - Disagree. There's a small inclination due to needing energy boosts occasionally but not enough motivation or budget to act upon it.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score: 2) - Neutral leaning towards Disagree. It stays on the periphery of consideration, especially if more affordable alternatives exist.

Overall, while I acknowledge the ad's effectiveness in conveying urgency and potential benefits, my personal values and current circumstances lead me to a cautious stance with low purchase intention scores. The lackluster attraction due to perceived manipulation and budget limitations further reinforce this evaluation.
