**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    - I like the ad (Score: **3**) – Neutral; It doesn't particularly stand out.
    - The ad is interesting (Score: **4**) – Agree; Promises energy and appearance benefits are engaging but not groundbreaking.
    - I believe it’s good (Score: **2**), Disagree; Lacks strong evidence or personal relevance for my lifestyle as a blue-collar worker focused on practicality over aesthetics.
    - The ad is attractive (Score: **5**) – Agree; Visuals and messaging can be appealing, but not compelling enough to sway me strongly.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    - I intend to purchase this product (Score: **1**), Strongly Disagree; My focus on practical needs over daily supplements or beauty aids makes it unlikely.
    - I will try to buy this product (Score: **2**) – Disagree; While open-minded, immediate trial isn't high priority given current budget and priorities.
    - I will consider buying the product (Score: **3**), Neutral; Might be worth a look if there's a need or discount aligning with my practical needs. 

Overall, while moderately interested due to its presentation, it doesn’t resonate deeply enough for an immediate purchase decision based on my values and lifestyle as outlined by my demographic profile and personality traits.
