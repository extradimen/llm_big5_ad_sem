**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **I like the ad (4):** The advertisement may capture my interest to a certain extent due to its promise of energy and vitality but doesn't strongly resonate with me.
  - **Interesting (3):** While it's moderately interesting, given my age group and lifestyle, I find other aspects more appealing.
  - **Good (2):** It lacks compelling evidence or personal relevance; thus, I wouldn’t consider it to be genuinely good for a mature demographic like mine.
  - **Attractive (3):** The ad is somewhat visually engaging but doesn't deeply attract me due to my preference for substantive content over mere appearance.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to purchase (1):** Strongly disagree; the benefits highlighted don’t align with my current health and lifestyle priorities.
  - **Will try to buy (2):** Neutral leaning toward Disagree; while curiosity might lead me to look into it, the intention isn't strong enough for an immediate trial.
  - **Consider buying (1):** Strongly disagree; despite some interest, I wouldn’t seriously consider this product given other credible alternatives and personal needs.

Overall, while there’s a mild positive response to its presentation, my core values (such as practicality and thoroughness) don't align sufficiently with the benefits offered. Therefore, purchase intention remains low.
