**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - **I like the ad (3):** While not strongly in favor, I appreciate its straightforward approach.
  - **Interesting (2):** It's mildly interesting due to addressing common fatigue and appearance concerns.
  - **Good (4):** Neutral leaning towards positive; it effectively highlights potential issues but isn't particularly compelling.
  - **Attractive (3):** The ad design is somewhat attractive, though not exceptionally so.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product (5):** While I acknowledge the benefits implied by feeling less tired and looking more alert, my decision is influenced mainly by necessity rather than strong desire.
  - **Will try to buy this product (6):** Given its relevance to daily fatigue issues, it's worth giving a trial based on general trust in products addressing these needs.
  - **Consider buying the product (7):** I am open and likely will consider purchasing if other factors like affordability, brand reliability, and customer reviews align well.

Overall, the ad connects with my practical mindset but doesn't elicit an immediate strong emotional response. My intent leans towards trying and considering it seriously due to its preventive nature addressing daily experiences relevant to me as a blue-collar worker.
