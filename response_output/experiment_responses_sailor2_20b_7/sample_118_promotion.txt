**Rationale:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
  - *Like (3):* I don't dislike the ad but it doesn’t resonate strongly; my reserved nature and occasional rudeness make me skeptical.
  - *Interesting (4):* It's somewhat engaging given its promise of energy, though not captivating enough due to a lack of personal connection or appeal in daily life context for a blue-collar worker like myself.
  - *Good (2):* The message is simplistic and common, lacking depth that would make me consider it valuable. Not strongly disagreeing but still low on impact.
  - *Attractive (1):* Finding the ad attractive isn't likely since I lean toward being reserved and uninterested in superficial aspects.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend (1):* Strongly unlikely, as my budget constraints and prioritization of necessities over cosmetics drive a low purchase intent.
  - *Try to Buy (2):* Somewhat curious but not motivated enough; concerns about its practical value outweigh the slight interest.
  - *Consider Buying (2):* Given occasional worry and nervousness, it might cross my mind once in a while, especially during moments of stress, yet it's still on the backburner for basic needs first.

Overall, while the ad isn't outright unappealing, its superficial focus doesn’t align with my cautious, reserved, and budget-conscious nature. Thus, low scores reflect an indifferent to negative response.
