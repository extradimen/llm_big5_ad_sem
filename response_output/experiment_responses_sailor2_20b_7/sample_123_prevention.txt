**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    - **I like the ad:** Neutral (3) – The appeal is moderate; it doesn't strongly resonate.
    - **Interesting:** Agree (4) – Slightly interesting as fatigue and appearance concerns are relevant to daily life, but not highly engaging.
    - **Good quality:** Somewhat Disagree (2) – Seems generic rather than high-quality or unique in its message.
    - **Attractive:** Neutral (3) – Not particularly attractive due to common tiredness-dull looks claims.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    - **Intend to purchase:** Strongly Disagree (1) – Despite the concerns, there's no strong intention without further trust or compelling evidence.
    - **Try buying it:** Neutral/Disagree (2) – Might consider sampling if available locally but not an immediate buy decision.
    - **Consider buying:** Slightly Agree (2) – Open to the idea under certain conditions (e.g., special offers, brand reliability).

Overall, while the ad addresses real concerns and mildly interests me, it lacks strong persuasiveness or trustworthiness. Thus, low scores for purchase intention reflect cautiousness rather than outright dismissal.
