**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Evaluation:
1. **Like the ad (Score: 3)** - While I appreciate its direct messaging about energy and appearance, it's not particularly engaging given my neutral social tendencies.
2. **Interesting (Score: 4)** - The message is straightforward but doesn't captivate me deeply; more creative elements might improve interest.
3. **Believe the ad is good (Score: 2)** - It lacks credibility due to a generic and slightly exaggerated claim, which I tend not to trust easily.
4. **Attractive (Score: 5)** - The straightforward approach makes it somewhat appealing, but there's room for better aesthetics or emotional connection.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)** - Not strong enough; the ad doesn't align with my needs or lifestyle.
2. **Try to buy this product (Score: 2)** - Mild curiosity, but not sufficient motivation for an immediate trial.
3. **Consider buying this product (Score: 3)** - I might think about it if reviews are positive and fit within budget constraints.

Overall, the ad resonates mildly due to its clear messaging but falls short on appeal and trustworthiness, leading to a low intention of purchase despite some consideration.
