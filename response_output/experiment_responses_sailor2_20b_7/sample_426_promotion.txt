**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores (1–7):**
  - **I like the ad:** Neutral to slightly positive (`3`), given my reserved nature but appreciating straightforward messaging.
  - **Interesting:** Slightly agree (`4`). It holds attention with an energy and appearance promise, which aligns well for a civil servant needing sustained focus.
  - **Believe it's good:** Moderate agreement (`5`) due to the trustworthy tone, resonating with my strong trust in information.
  - **Attractive:** Neutral leaning towards neutral-low (`2`), as visuals or branding might not fully capture me given I'm reserved and emotionally stable.

- **Purchase Intention Scores (1–7):**
  - **Intend to purchase:** Slight intention (`4`). While appealing, there are many energy drinks on the market; a specific need or strong trust in this brand is required.
  - **Will try it:** Moderate trial intent (`4`). The claim of looking good aligns with maintaining professional appearance but I'm not driven by novelty alone.
  - **Consider buying:** High consideration (`6`). Practical benefits and potential for daily energy support make it a viable option worth further review or after-sales feedback.

Overall, while the ad is mildly engaging to positively neutral, its practical message nudges me towards considering purchase despite my reserved nature. Specific product qualities (brand trustworthiness, cost-effectiveness) would sway final decision-making.
