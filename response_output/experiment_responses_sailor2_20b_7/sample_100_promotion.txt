**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **I like the ad (3/7):**
   - Despite being a student with a moderately busy schedule and valuing energy, my preference for minimal social interaction means I'm not strongly drawn to energizing drinks that are marketed primarily on appearance benefits.

2. **I think the ad is interesting (4/7):**
   - The concept appeals slightly due to its focus on staying energetic, but it lacks novelty given my "Strongly Disagree" traits towards being original and imaginative.

3. **I believe the ad is good (5/7):**
   - While I recognize that staying energized can be beneficial, particularly for students like me, my neutral outlook on helpfulness means this doesn't hit all personal value points strongly enough to rate highly.

4. **I find the ad attractive (2/7):**
   - Being emotionally stable and not easily nervous, external appearance isn’t a primary motivator. Hence, I don't perceive the attractiveness of looking good as compelling enough from an energetic drink alone.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (1/7):**
   - Strongly disagree with considering it essential given my current lifestyle and priorities; other routines suffice for energy management.

2. **I will try to buy this product (1/7):**
   - Little desire to experiment due to existing habits, skepticism of instant benefits, and personal traits that don’t prioritize new supplements or beverages.

3. **I will consider buying this product (3/7):**
   - There's a minor consideration as an option under exceptional circumstances but not regularly in my budget planning; financial range aligns with affordability but lacks strong attraction to action upon it immediately. 

Overall, while the ad is moderately appealing and believable, personal traits and current lifestyle choices steer me away from making this product a priority purchase. Thus, low scores reflect skepticism rather than outright rejection.
