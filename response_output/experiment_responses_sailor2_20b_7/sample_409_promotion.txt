**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **I like the ad:** Neutral (3) – Given my reserved nature, I'm not immediately drawn to energetic or visually flashy ads.
   - **Interesting:** Disagree (2) – The promise of staying energized is generic; it doesn't spark curiosity for someone more focused on reliability and quality over appearance.
   - **Good:** Agree (4) – Though neutral in appeal, the message about looking best supports an overall positive outlook but lacks personal connection or unique value proposition.
   - **Attractive:** Neutral (3) – The concept is practical but not compelling enough to create a strong emotional pull.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend:** Strongly Agree (5) – Despite the ad's moderate appeal, my tendency towards thoroughness and following through with plans means I would consider it if consistent benefits are verified.
   - **Try:** Strongly Agree (6) – Given its functional promise, especially for staying energized, there’s a strong willingness to give it a try in alignment with personal goals of productivity.
   - **Consider:** Strongly Agree (7) – The idea resonates enough with my values around work efficiency and wellness that I am highly likely to consider purchasing the product.

Overall, while the ad doesn't excite me emotionally or socially, its practical benefits align with my professional needs, making it a strong consideration for purchase.
