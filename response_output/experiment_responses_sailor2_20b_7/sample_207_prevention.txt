- **I think the ad is interesting.**: Agree (4) - The message highlights a common concern and thus holds attention.
- **I believe the ad is good.**: Strongly Agree (5) - It effectively communicates potential consequences without fatigue or dullness persuasively.
- **I find the ad attractive.**: Disagree (2) - While functional, its straightforward approach lacks visual appeal for me.

**Purchase Intention Scores:**
- **I intend to purchase this product.**: Strongly Disagree (1) - My reserved nature makes me hesitant towards quick decisions based on ads.
- **I will try to buy this product.**: Disagree (2) - The negative impact scenario might pique curiosity but doesn't drive immediate action.
- **I will consider buying this product.**: Neutral (3) - While the ad presents a valid use case, other factors like brand reputation and personal needs must align before making a purchase decision.

Overall, while I find aspects of the advertisement compelling, my reserved personality and careful approach to purchases mean it doesn't strongly influence immediate or future decisions.
