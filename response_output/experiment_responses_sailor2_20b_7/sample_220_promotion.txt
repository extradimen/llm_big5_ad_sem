**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (score = 3):**
   - While I appreciate energetic and appearance-focused messages, it doesn’t strongly resonate with my personality or lifestyle.

2. **I think the ad is interesting (score = 4):**
   - It's engaging but does not fully captivate me due to its somewhat generic nature.

3. **I believe the ad is good (score = 5):**
   - The message about energy and appearance aligns with common consumer expectations, making it a reasonable promotion, though slightly clichéd.

4. **I find the ad attractive (score = 2):**
   - Not particularly appealing given my reserved nature; I prefer ads that focus on substance over glamor.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (score = 4):**
   - Neutral leaning towards positive, as maintaining energy is important but not a primary driver in my current consumption habits.

2. **I will try to buy this product (score = 6):**
   - Curiosity and helpfulness toward trying new things slightly outweigh the lack of strong personal appeal.

3. **I will consider buying this product (score = 7):**
   - Though it might not be a top priority, its benefits align with general health goals, so I am open to purchasing if given more context or positive user feedback. 

Overall, while the ad is well-intentioned and somewhat effective in messaging, my reserved nature and preference for substantive over superficial content means it doesn't elicit strong personal enthusiasm but still holds some practical consideration for potential purchase.
