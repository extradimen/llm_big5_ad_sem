**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**: 
  - *Like*: Neutral – The promotion feels somewhat generic, so it doesn't particularly excite me but isn’t off-putting either.
  - *Interesting*: Agree – It catches my attention with promises of energy and improved appearance, relevant to daily life.
  - *Good*: Strongly Agree – Emphasizing staying energized aligns well with maintaining productivity as a civil servant. The promise of looking good appeals too.
  - *Attractive*: Disagree – The ad’s visual style or messaging isn't compelling enough for me given my preferences.

- **Purchase Intention**:
  - *Intend to Purchase*: Neutral – While it's appealing, there are many energy drink options already in the market; I need more specific reasons or brand loyalty.
  - *Try to Buy*: Agree – Given its potential benefits and current appeal, trying once wouldn't be a bad idea.
  - *Consider Buying*: Strongly Agree – The features align with my needs for sustained energy and wellness, making it worth considering over time.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad's message and find parts of it compelling (especially the health-oriented aspects), its attractiveness is limited. However, strong interest in personal well-being makes me likely to at least try or consider purchasing this product eventually.
