**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **I like the ad:** Neutral (3) – The claim is straightforward but not particularly engaging for someone who values emotional stability and practicality.
   - **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (4) – It addresses a common concern related to energy levels, which can attract attention. 
   - **I believe the ad is good:** Slightly Positive (5) – The prevention aspect resonates with my need for maintaining appearance and productivity, though not overwhelmingly so.
   - **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree slightly (2) – While I appreciate its message, it doesn't appeal strongly due to being too focused on external effects.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product:** Moderate Consideration (3) – There's awareness of potential benefits but not a strong drive.
   - **Will try to buy this product:** Somewhat Likely (4) – If the price and convenience align, I might give it a trial.
   - **Consider buying this product:** Slightly Higher Intention (5) – The idea holds some weight; I'll keep an open mind about future purchases based on personal experience.

Overall, while the ad is decent in its messaging for someone like me, it lacks strong emotional appeal and may not be enough to prompt immediate or enthusiastic action. It lands more towards a practical consideration rather than an irresistible desire.
