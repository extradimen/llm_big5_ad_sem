**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad (score = 5)**: The claim of feeling tired and looking dull might resonate with a young blue-collar worker who values stamina. However, it doesnâ€™t strongly engage me due to its generic appeal.
- **I think the ad is interesting (score = 4)**: There's some curiosity but not enough excitement given my personality trait that prefers engaging content over simple claims.
- **I believe the ad is good (score = 3.5)**: Neutral leaning towards skepticism, as I'm unimpressed by the lack of specificity and strong evidence for its benefits.
- **I find the ad attractive (score = 2.5)**: Attraction is minimal; it lacks emotional depth or connection with my values.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product (score = 1)**: Strongly disagree, as I don't feel compelled by the ad's message and prefer products supported by concrete benefits.
- **I will try to buy this product (score = 1)**: Similarly low score; no compelling reason to test it without further convincing information.
- **I will consider buying this product (score = 1)**: Even considering is unlikely, given my preference for thorough job performance and lack of trust in its effectiveness shown through the ad.

Overall, while understanding its message, I find the advertisement lacking sufficient appeal or credibility to impact my purchase behavior. Other factors would need to be addressed to sway my decision positively.
