**Evaluation:**

### Attitudes toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (score = 3)
   - While not strongly positive or negative, I appreciate that it promises benefits relevant to staying energized and looking good.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Slightly Agree (score = 4)
   - The message aligns with common wellness goals but doesn't excite me enough to be very engaging.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Agree (score = 5)
   - Promises are clear, and there's a sense of trustworthiness from its straightforward approach.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** Neutral (score = 3)
   - The visual appeal might be average; it’s functional but lacks emotional connection for me.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Slightly Disagree (score = 2)
   - My current priorities in a blue-collar role focus more on reliability and budget than immediate energy boosts, so the intent isn't strong.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Neutral (score = 2)
   - Given my financial constraints, trying it out is less likely unless there’s an incentive or regular need.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** Slightly Agree (score = 3)
   - Though not a top priority, the health benefits might come into play during periods of stress or when I'm looking for lifestyle improvements without a significant financial burden.

Overall, while the ad effectively communicates its value proposition, it doesn't strongly resonate with my current life circumstances and priorities. The intention to purchase remains low but open to consideration under certain conditions.
