**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
    - *I like the ad.* (Score: 5): I find it reasonably engaging as it addresses common issues of fatigue and appearance, which can be relatable for many.
    - *It is interesting.* (Score: 4): The concept isn’t groundbreaking but presents a clear problem-solution format that catches attention.
    - *I believe the ad is good.* (Score: 3): While effective in highlighting potential drawbacks of not using the product, it's somewhat cliché and lacks compelling evidence or personal connection for me.
    - *It’s attractive.* (Score: 6): The overall design and messaging resonate with my need to look energetic and vital.

2. **Purchase Intention**
    - *I intend to purchase this product.* (Score: 2): Despite liking the ad, there isn't enough evidence or personal relevance to prompt a strong intent.
    - *I will try to buy this product.* (Score: 3): The persuasive elements make me mildly inclined toward trying it once.
    - *I will consider buying this product.* (Score: 4): It's on my radar, but additional user reviews or tangible benefits would move the needle higher.

In summary, while I appreciate the ad’s focus and understand its appeal, my cautious nature (Strongly Disagree with emotional stability) keeps me from a firm commitment without further proof of effectiveness. However, it does spark mild curiosity, making it worth considering for occasional purchase if circumstances align.
