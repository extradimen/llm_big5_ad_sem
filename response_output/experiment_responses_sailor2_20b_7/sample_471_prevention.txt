**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement (7-point scale):**
  - **I like the ad.**: 3 – Neutral; Though talkative and somewhat sociable in some contexts, I don't find it particularly engaging.
  - **I think the ad is interesting.**: 4 – Slightly Agree; The message feels generic but slightly appealing to those who experience fatigue regularly.
  - **I believe the ad is good.**: 5 – Agree; It highlights a common issue (feeling tired and looking dull), which can be effective in conveying potential benefits of its product.
  - **I find the ad attractive.**: 2 – Disagree; As someone who values thoroughness over quick fixes, I'm not drawn to superficial solutions.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **I intend to purchase this product.**: 1 – Strongly Disagree; Despite acknowledging fatigue issues, my high standards for credibility and trust in products lead me to be cautious.
  - **I will try to buy this product.**: 2 – Disagree; Though open-minded about trying new things when backed by strong evidence, this ad lacks compelling reassurances.
  - **I will consider buying this product.**: 3 – Neutral; It's worth considering if additional information or endorsements align with my reserved and thorough approach.

Overall, while acknowledging the relevance of fatigue concerns, my reserved nature coupled with a need for more convincing proof affects both attraction to the ad and willingness to purchase.
