**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** Score of **5**: I find it somewhat engaging given its clear messaging about fatigue and appearance.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Score of **4**: It's not particularly captivating but gets the point across efficiently.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** Score of **6**: The message seems credible, leveraging common concerns which can be effective in product ads.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Score of **3**: Although it conveys a helpful idea, it doesn't stand out visually or emotionally for me.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Score of **2** (Agree): The advertisement does pique interest but isn’t compelling enough on its own.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Score of **1** (Disagree): There’s not strong motivation to seek it out or test the product immediately.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** Score of **2**: I acknowledge potential benefit, so I wouldn't dismiss it entirely but am unlikely to act on the impulse alone.

Overall, while the ad is effective in communicating its core message (preventing fatigue and dull appearance), my personal preferences for thorough decision-making and lack of urgency means a lower likelihood of immediate purchase. The balance leans towards cautious consideration rather than strong intent.
