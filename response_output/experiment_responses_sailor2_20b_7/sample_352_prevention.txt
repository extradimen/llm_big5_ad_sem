**Evaluation and Justification:**

**Ad Attitude Scores:**
- **Like (Score: 5)**: The ad's messaging is somewhat appealing due to its focus on fatigue relief and boosting appearance. However, it doesn't strongly resonate with me.
  
- **Interesting (Score: 3)**: I find the message straightforward but not particularly engaging or innovative.

- **Good (Score: 4)**: It conveys a clear benefit, which is generally important for an ad, though lacks emotional depth that might capture my attention fully.

- **Attractive (Score: 2)**: The visual and verbal cues don't strongly draw me in; it feels somewhat generic compared to other ads I've seen.

**Purchase Intention Scores:**
- **Intend to Purchase (Score: 1)**: Despite acknowledging the product's potential benefits, my limited budget and current satisfaction with existing routines make a strong purchase intention unlikely.
  
- **Try to Buy (Score: 2)**: There is minimal incentive for me to experiment; I'd need more compelling reasons or offers.

- **Consider Buying (Score: 3)**: If the product's price aligns well within my budget and has positive reviews, it might become a consideration, but not an immediate decision. 

Overall, while understanding its benefits, the ad does not sufficiently sway me to take action due to practical constraints like cost and existing habits. Thus, I lean towards moderate interest without strong intent for purchase.
