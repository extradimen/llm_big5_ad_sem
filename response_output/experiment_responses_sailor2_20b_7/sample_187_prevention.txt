**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - *I like the ad.* (2): The message seems straightforward but not particularly engaging for someone who values practicality over flashiness.
   - *I think the ad is interesting.* (3): It's mildly intriguing, highlighting a common concern about fatigue and appearance, but lacks novelty or unique appeal given my personality traits.
   - *I believe the ad is good.* (4): The message resonates with concerns about energy levels and personal presentation; hence, it conveys an understandable benefit.
   - *I find the ad attractive.* (2): While functional, its straightforwardness doesn't captivate me due to a preference for more engaging content.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *Intend to purchase this product.* (5): Itâ€™s practical and addresses real needs; however, I need further information about effectiveness.
   - *Will try to buy this product.* (6): My strong agreement with being thorough makes me willing to give it a trial under the assumption of potential improvement in well-being.
   - *Consider buying this product.* (5): There is moderate consideration due to its relevance but not an immediate drive, as I prioritize tangible outcomes.

In summary, while my personality leans towards practicality and reliability, which aligns with preventive health products, the ad needs additional emphasis on trustworthiness and effectiveness for a stronger impact. The scores reflect cautious optimism toward both liking the advertisement and seriously considering purchase.
