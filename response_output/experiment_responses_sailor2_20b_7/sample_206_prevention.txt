**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**  
  - **Like (Score = 3):** While the ad is not highly engaging to me given my reserved nature and lack of strong emotional response, I find it decently persuasive.
  - **Interesting (Score = 4):** The message about feeling tired and looking dull resonates somewhat but doesn't captivate enough for high interest.
  - **Good (Score = 5):** It effectively communicates a need that many people might face, making the ad informative without being over-the-top.
  - **Attractive (Score = 2):** My reserved personality leans me towards finding it less visually or emotionally appealing.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
  - **Intend to Purchase (Score = 3):** I acknowledge its relevance but am not strongly motivated due to my cautious and practical nature.
  - **Try to Buy (Score = 4):** Given the moderate concern for fatigue, there's some intent to explore it further if within budget constraints.
  - **Consider Buying (Score = 4):** With limited income (<15 million VND), I will weigh options carefully before making a purchase decision.

Overall, while not overly compelling or personally exciting, the ad does address common issues and is reasonably well-presented. It's something that might prompt consideration but doesn't guarantee immediate action due to my cautious nature and financial situation.
