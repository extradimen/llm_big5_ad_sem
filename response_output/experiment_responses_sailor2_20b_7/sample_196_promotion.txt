**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like (3)**: The ad is moderately appealing but not strongly engaging due to my preference for substance over flashy presentation, given my reserved nature and lack of emotional stability.
  - **Interesting (4)**: It sparks curiosity somewhat, aligning with the need for new ideas while being cautious about credibility.
  - **Good (5)**: I find it generally well-conceived; however, trust issues mean I'm not entirely convinced without further validation.
  - **Attractive (2)**: The attractiveness is limited because of my emotional instability and low artistic interest in such promotional content.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to Purchase**: Moderate intention due to the perceived benefits but needing concrete proof and possibly more targeted messaging for a firm commitment.
  - **Try/Consider Buying**: Openness to trying or considering, influenced by my thorough approach to new products and potential alignment with my daily needs.

Overall, while I am open-minded toward the product's promise of energy and appearance enhancement, reservations about trustworthiness and personal engagement hold back strong purchase intent. The scores reflect a balanced yet cautious evaluation based on my personality traits and background.
