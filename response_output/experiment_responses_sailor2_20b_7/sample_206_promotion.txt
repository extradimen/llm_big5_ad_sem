**Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
- **I like the ad**: 4 (Neutral)
  - Being reserved and emotionally stable means I'm not overly enthusiastic but find it pleasant enough.

- **I think the ad is interesting**: 3 (Slightly Agree)
  - While neutral about being outgoing, this claim slightly piques my interest in staying energized.

- **I believe the ad is good**: 5 (Agree)
  - Given that I'm generally trusting and agree with its health-oriented message, it seems credible enough to be considered "good."

- **I find the ad attractive**: 2 (Disagree)
  - As a reserved individual who prioritizes practicality over flashy appeals, my attraction is low.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
- **Intend to purchase this product**: 1 (Strongly Disagree)
  - My current financial situation (<15,000,000 VND/month) makes it unlikely I'll commit to an expensive supplement without necessity or significant need.

- **Will try to buy this product**: 2 (Disagree)
  - While the ad's messaging resonates at a low level, my budget constraints and lack of urgency discourage trying it out.

- **Consider buying this product in future**: 3 (Neutral/Lean Towards Agree)
  - If I face a situation where energy boosters become necessary or find discounts/promotions appealing, I might consider it. However, not an immediate priority right now. 

Overall, the ad is seen as fairly positive but falls short on personal engagement and purchasing power due to practical constraints and reserved nature.
