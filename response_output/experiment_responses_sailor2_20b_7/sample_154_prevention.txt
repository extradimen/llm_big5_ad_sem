**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - **I like the ad (Score: 3)** — While I appreciate its intention to prevent feelings of tiredness and dullness, it feels slightly generic.
  - **Interesting (Score: 4)** — The message is straightforward but not particularly engaging for me; it could benefit from a more compelling or relatable scenario.
  - **Good (Score: 5)** — It conveys the product’s main function effectively. However, its execution needs to be improved in terms of creativity and emotional connection.
  - **Attractive (Score: 2)** — The ad lacks visual appeal and doesn't trigger my personal interest or sense of urgency.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 3)** — Neutral leaning towards positive; I recognize the need for energy boosts, but there are many alternatives.
  - **Try to buy this product (Score: 2)** — Slightly negative. The ad's appeal isn’t strong enough to push me into immediate action without more compelling reasons or brand familiarity.
  - **Consider buying it (Score: 1)** — Low consideration; I might look at other options first because the ad doesn't create a memorable impression or urgency for my needs.

Overall, while acknowledging the relevance of preventing tiredness and dull appearance in daily life, the advertisement fails to fully engage me due to its generic approach. For an office worker like myself, more personalized benefits or innovative presentation could significantly improve both attitude toward the ad and purchase intent.
