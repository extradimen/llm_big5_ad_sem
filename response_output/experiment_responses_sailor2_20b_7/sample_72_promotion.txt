**Evaluation and Justification:**

### **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad:** *Score of 3 (Neutral)*
   - My reserved nature makes me cautious about energetic claims.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** *Score of 2 (Disagree)* 
   - The lack of novelty and originality in typical energy drink ads don't catch my attention, especially given I have few artistic interests.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** *Score of 3 (Neutral)*
   - While not strongly positive or negative, it's neutral based on my generally trusting outlook but cautious approach to health claims.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** *Score of 1 (Strongly Disagree)* 
   - My careful and nervous personality means I'm skeptical about exaggerated promises without solid evidence.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** *Score of 4 (Disagree) *
   - Despite being a civil servant, my budget constraints coupled with the ad's lack of persuasive appeal make an outright intention low.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** *Score of 5 (Agree)*
   - I may consider giving it a trial run if there are reliable reviews or reasonable prices, but not automatically.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** *Score of 6 (Strongly Agree) *
   - Given my tendency towards cautious planning and health-consciousness, I'll evaluate the drink based on user experiences before making a decision.

In summary, while the ad might pique mild interest due to its basic promise, it doesn't strongly resonate with me personally. The potential for trying or considering is there but not guaranteed by the advertisement itself. A more tailored message addressing specific concerns and backed by reliable data would likely improve my overall reception and intention scores.
