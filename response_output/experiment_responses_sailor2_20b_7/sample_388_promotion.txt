**Evaluation and Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like (4/7):**
   - As a reserved individual who generally prefers not to be overly talkative, I find the messaging somewhat engaging but not overwhelmingly appealing.

2. **Interesting (5/7):**
   - The promise of staying energized and looking your best is relevant enough for someone balancing student life with family commitments. It intrigues but doesn't captivate me fully.

3. **Good (3/7):**
   - While the ad aims to highlight benefits, I find it lacks substantial details about how these effects are achieved or substantiatedâ€”less compelling in terms of credibility for a cautious consumer like myself.

4. **Attractive (6/7):**
   - The visual and emotional appeal resonates because maintaining energy and appearance is important. Despite my reservations, the overall presentation feels somewhat attractive.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase (2/7):** 
   - Though I appreciate the goals set out by the product, there's a lack of detailed trust-building information which hinders immediate purchasing intent.

2. **Try to buy (1/7):**
   - Given my generally strong agreement with planning and following through but also being cautious about new products, I'd be unlikely to make an impulsive purchase without more reassurance or reviews from trusted sources.

3. **Consider buying (3/7):**
   - The product aligns somewhat with my needs; thus, it's on the radar for future consideration after gathering additional information and possibly seeing real-life results from others similar in lifestyle and demographics to me.

In summary, while I am moderately engaged by the ad due to its focus on energy and appearance (4-6 out of 7), my cautious nature and lack of immediate trust lead to a low purchase intent score. However, it's not entirely off my radar for future exploration if further verified benefits emerge.
