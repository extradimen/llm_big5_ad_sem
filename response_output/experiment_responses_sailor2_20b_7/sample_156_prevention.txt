**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **I like the ad (score=3):** Neutral leaning slightly negative; while it's not strongly disliked, its messaging doesn't resonate deeply.
   - **Interesting (score=4):** Fairly interesting due to its direct warning about tiredness and dull appearance but lacks engaging elements for me.
   - **Good (score=5):** I view the ad as reasonably good in terms of clarity and relevance—it addresses common concerns effectively, though it doesn't feel particularly impressive or innovative.
   - **Attractive (score=2):** Unattractively low; despite its potential benefits, the straightforward scare tactic feels overbearing and less appealing compared to more subtle messaging.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase (score=4):** Moderately inclined but not strongly motivated—benefits are acknowledged, yet other factors might outweigh this decision.
   - **Try to buy (score=4):** Similar hesitation; willing to give it a try but not committed fully due to the persuasive style.
   - **Consider buying (score=3):** Willingly consider it, though my strong agree with sometimes being rude means I don't rely entirely on marketing claims. Additional factors like price or reviews would be crucial.

Overall, while understanding the ad’s purpose and recognizing its benefits, personal traits such as distrust of overbearing persuasion influence a moderate to cautious approach towards purchasing intent. The high score in "original" suggests openness to trying innovative products but not being swayed easily by fear-based marketing.
