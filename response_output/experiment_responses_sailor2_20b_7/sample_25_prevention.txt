**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - I like the ad (Score = 4): While talkative and sociable, my strong sense of helpfulness makes me appreciate how it addresses fatigue issues.
   - I think the ad is interesting (Score = 3): The message resonates somewhat but lacks emotional connection or creativity for high engagement.
   - I believe the ad is good (Score = 5): It conveys a clear benefit, which aligns with my values of practicality and usefulness in daily life.
   - I find the ad attractive (Score = 2): Despite strong agreement on original ideas, this simple prevention message doesn't captivate me aesthetically or emotionally.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - I intend to purchase this product (Score = 2): The moderate appeal and practicality make it considerate but not compelling enough for a solid intention.
   - I will try to buy this product (Score = 3): Mild curiosity prompts me to give it a shot, especially if it's affordable within my budget.
   - I will consider buying this product (Score = 4): While emotionally stable is not strong, practical benefits lead me towards considering the purchase under favorable circumstances.

In summary, the ad effectively communicates its preventive message but needs more creativity and personal relevance to boost enthusiasm. The intention leans toward cautious consideration rather than immediate action due to my demographic and personality profile.
