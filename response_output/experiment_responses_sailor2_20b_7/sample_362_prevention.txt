**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - **I like the ad (Score: 6):** While not strongly agreeing, I find it appealing as a preventive message. However, its presentation could be more engaging.
  - **Interesting:** The concept of fatigue and dullness is intriguing but might need better storytelling for higher engagement (Score: 5).
  - **Good:** It conveys clarity about the product's benefits, yet lacks emotional depth or personal relevance (Score: 4).
  - **Attractive:** Despite some design appeal, it could be more visually compelling to draw my full attention (Score: 3).

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 2):** The ad's messaging resonates with the preventive aspect but doesn't drive immediate action due to a lack of strong personal connection.
  - **Will try to buy this product (Score: 2):** There is some curiosity, but additional information or social proof would sway me more.
  - **Consider buying this product (Score: 1):** Low consideration as the ad doesn't sufficiently align with my high standards for thoroughness and originality in purchasing decisions.

Overall, while acknowledging its benefits, further refinement in emotional connection, creativity, and presentation could boost both attitude scores and purchase intentions.
