**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like (3/7):** Neutral because while not strongly disliked, it doesn't resonate deeply either due to personal preferences and lifestyle balance.
   - **Interesting (4/7):** Agree – The concept of staying energized and looking good is appealing in a practical sense.
   - **Good (5/7):** Strongly Agree – Valuable message for busy lifestyles, aligns with health-conscious attitudes. 
   - **Attractive (2/7):** Disagree – It's not particularly visually or emotionally engaging enough.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend:** Considerably low but still positive (3), as the benefits are relevant without a strong drive to purchase immediately.
   - **Try:** Moderate intention to try (4) since it addresses daily needs and fits within my budgetary limits.
   - **Consider:** Strongly Agree (5) – Given its potential for energy improvement and overall wellness, I will definitely evaluate this product seriously.

Overall, while the ad is persuasive enough with a positive message, personal preferences and tendencies towards caution mean that strong immediate intent to purchase isn't guaranteed. Nonetheless, it's worth considering based on practical benefits.
