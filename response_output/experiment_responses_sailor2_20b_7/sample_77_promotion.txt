**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude towards the Advertisement:** 
  - *Like (Score 4):* Neutral enjoyment but not overly excited.
  - *Interesting (Score 3):* The concept resonates moderately, though it doesn't captivate intensely.
  - *Good (Score 5):* It conveys a message that aligns with general health and appearance goals without strong skepticism.
  - *Attractive (Score 2):* Visual appeal is minimal; the ad's attractiveness isn’t compelling.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *Intend to Purchase:* Neutral, not high on priority due to other financial commitments.
  - *Try to Buy:* Slightly higher intent since it aligns with staying energized and looking good but won't be a spur-of-the-moment decision.
  - *Consider Buying:* The product is in the consideration phase; factors such as price and personal needs will play crucial roles.

In summary, while the ad isn’t highly persuasive due to its lack of strong emotional connection or vivid appeal, it still has potential for purchase given practical benefits align with health-conscious values. The cautious nature (due to financial constraints) prevents immediate intent but opens a pathway for future consideration.
