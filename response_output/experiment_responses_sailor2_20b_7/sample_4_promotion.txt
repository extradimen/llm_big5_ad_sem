**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (6/7):**
   - As a talkative and outgoing individual who values thoroughness in my job, I appreciate the clear messaging of staying energized and looking best.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (5/7):**
   - The claim resonates with managing daily responsibilities but could be more engaging with additional details on how it achieves these benefits.

3. **I believe the ad is good (4/7):**
   - While I trust brands generally, some elaboration on evidence or user testimonials would strengthen its credibility.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (3/7):**
   - The visual and messaging appeal to my desire for energy but falls short in emotional connection and originality.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (2/7):**
   - My strong agreement on thoroughness and planning is balanced by a neutral attitude towards being careful, making immediate intent low.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (1/7):**
   - The ad's persuasive power isn't sufficient to prompt an attempt at purchase; additional information about benefits would be crucial.

3. **I will consider buying the product (2/7):**
   - Despite some skepticism, my agreement on making plans and being original leaves room for considering it if more specific details emerge or I see positive feedback from others.

In summary:
- The ad is moderately appealing but lacks compelling evidence.
- Purchase intention remains low due to a lack of detailed benefits and personal relevance.
