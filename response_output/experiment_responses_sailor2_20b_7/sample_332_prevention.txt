**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**: 
  - **Like (3)**: Neutral-to-mildly positive; I don't find it particularly appealing but also not repulsive.
  - **Interesting (4)**: Somewhat interesting; it draws attention to common experiences of fatigue and appearance, which are relatable.
  - **Good (2)**: Moderately disagreeable; while the message is straightforward, its presentation lacks depth or creativity.
  - **Attractive (2)**: Not attractive; the ad feels generic and doesnâ€™t connect on a personal level.

- **Purchase Intention**:
  - **Intend to Purchase (2)**: Low intention; though I acknowledge fatigue issues, no strong impulse to buy due to other priorities and lack of compelling evidence.
  - **Will Try to Buy (3)**: Mild consideration; given my worry about looking dull, it might slightly nudge me towards exploration but not enough for an immediate purchase.
  - **Consider Buying (1)**: Minimal likelihood; although concerns exist, competing interests and skepticism reduce the chance of acting on this ad alone.

Overall, while I appreciate its relevance to fatigue and appearance concerns, a stronger personal connection or additional compelling factors would be required for me to seriously consider buying the product.
