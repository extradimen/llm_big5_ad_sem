**Evaluation Details:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement
1. **I like the ad**: Neutral (`3`): I don't particularly dislike it, but there's no emotional connection or enthusiasm.
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: Disagree (`2`): The message feels too generic and doesnâ€™t captivate my attention.
3. **I believe the ad is good**: Disagree (`2`): It lacks compelling evidence or relatability for someone like me with minimal financial resources and a reserved nature.
4. **I find the ad attractive**: Strongly Disagree (`1`): The appeal of being more energetic and appearing brighter doesn't resonate given my low social inclination and current circumstances.

### Purchase Intention
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: Disagree (`2`): Although it claims benefits, I'm hesitant due to financial constraints (income < 15 million VND) and personal preference for practicality over appearances.
2. **I will try to buy this product**: Strongly Disagree (`1`): No immediate urge or plan to invest in such a drink when other essential expenses take priority.
3. **I will consider buying this product**: Neutral (`3`): While not ruling it out entirely, my cautious nature and current financial situation keep me from actively considering it.

Overall, the advertisement does not align well with my reserved demeanor, practicality-focused mindset, or budget constraints. Thus, while I remain open-minded (Neutral in consideration), there's a clear lack of enthusiasm to buy or try this product.
