**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3)** - Neutral leaning slightly negative due to my tendency towards skepticism.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)** - Moderately interested; engaging promises of energy and appearance appeal but not enough to strongly resonate given personal priorities.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5)** - Somewhat positive, acknowledging the presentation quality might be persuasive for others but doesn't align with my core values fully.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)** - Not particularly attracted; energetic claims feel generic and less impactful considering personal lifestyle.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)** - Strongly disagree; despite occasional fatigue, other priorities such as budget constraints make a regular buy unlikely.
2. **Will try to buy this product (Score: 2)** - Mildly inclined to give it a try due to social pressure or curiosity but not strongly motivated by current needs.
3. **Will consider buying the product (Score: 1)** - Very low consideration; while open-minded, practicality and financial limitations heavily weigh against purchasing.

Overall, I find aspects of the ad appealing yet unconvincing given my conservative spending habits, modest income, and emphasis on reliability over hype. Thus, there's a lower likelihood to actually invest in this product despite initial interest.
