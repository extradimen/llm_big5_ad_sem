**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** *Score = 4 (Neutral)*  
   - The claim of staying energized resonates with my busy lifestyle, but it lacks emotional connection or personal relevance.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** *Score = 3 (Slightly Disagree)*  
   - While I appreciate its message, the presentation feels generic and fails to captivate me deeply.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** *Score = 5 (Agree)*  
   - The product promise is valid; staying energized and looking best can be appealing for daily routines, but the execution could have been more compelling.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** *Score = 2 (Strongly Disagree)*  
   - Its appearance doesn't appeal to my personal tastes or stand out in an oversaturated market.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** *Score = 1 (Strongly Disagree)*  
   - The ad's broad, generic messaging is insufficient for motivating a strong commitment.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** *Score = 1 (Strongly Disagree)*  
   - My cautious nature and lack of immediate need make it unlikely I'll proactively seek out the product.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** *Score = 3 (Neutral, Considered)**  
   - If given a discount or additional information highlighting specific benefits that align with my preferences, there may be room for consideration.

In summary, while acknowledging its positive aspects, I am not highly inclined to take action based on the ad's current presentation. Improved differentiation and emotional engagement could enhance both attitude and purchase intention scores.
