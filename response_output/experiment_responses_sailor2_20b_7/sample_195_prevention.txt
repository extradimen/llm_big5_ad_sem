**Evaluation Details:**

### Ad Attitude:
- **I like the ad:** Neutral to slightly disagree because it's too straightforward and focuses on fear rather than engaging benefits.
- **I think the ad is interesting:** Slightly agree, but not enough to make me genuinely engaged or intrigued.
- **I believe the ad is good:** Strongly disagree; it feels manipulative by playing on tiredness and appearance.
- **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree—lacks appeal with its negative framing.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend to purchase this product:** Strongly disagree. The fear-based messaging does not resonate or motivate me personally.
- **Will try to buy this product:** Disagree; there’s no compelling reason for a trial, especially given my skepticism about the ad's approach.
- **Will consider buying this product:** Neutral—while it doesn't push me away entirely, I won’t actively seek it out based on the current presentation.

In summary, while the advertisement may catch attention briefly due to its stark warning, my personal preferences lean towards more positive and creative marketing strategies. Hence, the low scores reflect a lack of appeal and purchase intent driven by this specific ad format.
