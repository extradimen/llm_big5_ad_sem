**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - *I like the ad (5):* Neutral leaning slightly positive. The promise of energy and looking good appeals, but it’s not a standout factor.
   - *Interesting (4):* Moderately interesting; energizing benefits are common in product ads.
   - *Believe is Good (6):* Slightly higher confidence due to the strong emphasis on health and appearance.
   - *Attractive (3):* Not very attractive. The messaging feels slightly generic rather than innovative.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend to Purchase (2):* Low intent; while the benefits are appealing, there isn't enough compelling reason for immediate purchase with numerous other options available.
   - *Try to Buy (3):* Somewhat likely if it aligns with current needs and affordability fits within my budget.
   - *Consider Buying (4):* I'll keep an open mind but won’t prioritize this over tried-and-tested products.

Overall, the ad is reasonable but not exceptional for someone like me. It resonates well enough to consider trying or considering its purchase under specific circumstances without strong motivation to buy immediately.
