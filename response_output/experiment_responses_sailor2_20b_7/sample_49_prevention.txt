**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (4)**: Neutral — The ad's message resonates somewhat because of my understanding of fatigue and appearance, but it doesn't evoke strong positive emotions.
   - **Interesting (5)**: Agree — I find the concept interesting since dealing with tiredness is a common issue, especially in my busy lifestyle.
   - **Good (3)**: Disagree — The ad seems cliché and not particularly creative; hence, I think it's average at best.
   - **Attractive (2)**: Disagree — It lacks compelling visuals or unique presentation that would make me pay close attention.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend (1)**: Strongly Disagree — While understanding the need for energy drinks, my current budget and priorities don't align with regular purchases.
   - **Try (2)**: Disagree — I might consider it as a last resort due to financial constraints but won’t actively seek out this product.
   - **Consider (3)**: Slightly Agree — The ad brings the issue to mind, so if circumstances change or there’s a better promotion, I could lean towards considering the purchase.

Overall, though intrigued by its relevance and practicality, my personality traits coupled with financial considerations lead me toward being moderately open but not committed to buying this product.
