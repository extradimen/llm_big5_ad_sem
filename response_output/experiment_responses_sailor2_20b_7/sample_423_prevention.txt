**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
  - **I like the ad. (score: 3)**: While not strongly agreeing or disliking, I find it somewhat appealing given its focus on energy and appearance.
  - **I think the ad is interesting. (score: 2)**: It’s okay; however, my limited interest in self-care makes me less intrigued by motivational ads like this one.
  - **I believe the ad is good. (score: 4)**: The message seems plausible but lacks strong emotional connection or personal relevance for me.
  - **I find the ad attractive. (score: 3)**: Neutral to slightly positive, it isn’t captivating enough due to my generally reserved and pragmatic nature.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **I intend to purchase this product. (score: 1)**: Not at all inclined; given my financial constraints and focus on necessities over luxury energy drinks.
  - **I will try to buy this product. (score: 2)**: Slightly higher than 'intend', but still unlikely due to budget concerns.
  - **I will consider buying this product. (score: 2)**: A very low possibility; my current priorities and perceived need don't align with purchasing an energy drink regularly.

Overall, the advertisement may resonate mildly on a rational level but doesn’t drive strong emotional engagement or practical consideration in my lifestyle. Therefore, purchase intent remains low despite some moderate interest in the ad's message.
