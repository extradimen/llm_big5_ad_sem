**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like (2):** While I appreciate a straightforward message about the drink's benefits, it feels slightly manipulative in highlighting negative outcomes without clear evidence.
  - **Interesting (3):** The ad’s premise is somewhat engaging but lacks depth or creativity to captivate me fully.
  - **Good (4):** It does convey its purpose effectively, albeit rather predictably. There could be better ways of presenting the message.
  - **Attractive (1):** I don't find it visually appealing and might come across as generic marketing.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend (3):** Although skeptical, I'm open to considering this product due to my high workload that can make me feel tired. The claim resonates partially but not strongly enough for immediate purchase.
  - **Try (2):** Given the somewhat compelling yet weakly presented benefits and trust in other brands' similar offerings, I might try a sample or promotion offer.
  - **Consider (2):** While it doesn’t immediately persuade me to buy, it does push the product into my awareness and consideration set.

In summary, while not strongly appealing, the ad nudges me towards potential interest due to practical benefits aligned with my needs. However, stronger evidence and a more engaging presentation would likely boost these scores further.
