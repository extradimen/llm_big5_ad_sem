**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **I like the ad:** `2` (Strongly Disagree)
     As a reserved individual who values solitude more than social stimulation, I find such an energetic and outward-focused advertisement less appealing.
   - **Interesting:** `3` (Disagree)
     The premise may not capture my attention given that it's centered on energy levels and appearanceâ€”topics that are not prioritized for someone in my demographic and lifestyle.
   - **Good:** `4` (Neutral to Slightly Agree)
     While the message is generic, I can understand its appeal to others but don't personally connect with it enough to call it good or bad.
   - **Attractive:** `2` (Strongly Disagree)
     The promotional tone feels out of sync with my reserved nature and trust issues regarding such claims.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product:** `1` (Strongly Disagree)
     My cautious approach, combined with a lack of alignment between the ad's messaging and personal values, makes it unlikely I would commit to buying.
   - **Will try to buy this product:** `1` (Strongly Disagree)
     Given my strong reservations about its relevance and persuasive tactics, there is no inclination toward trying the product out.
   - **Consider buying this product:** `2` (Disagree but open to consideration)
     While not enthusiastic, I'm aware of occasional curiosity; however, it would need additional compelling factors beyond the ad's surface level promises. 

Overall, while acknowledging the potential benefits mentioned in the ad, my personality traits and lifestyle biases lead me to a generally negative attitude toward this advertisement, with minimal purchase intent.
