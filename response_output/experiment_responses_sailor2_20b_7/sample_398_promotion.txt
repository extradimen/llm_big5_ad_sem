**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**  
  - **I like the ad**: Neutral (3). The product’s promise of energy and appearance appeal is somewhat interesting but doesn’t strongly resonate.
  - **Interesting**: Agree (4). It captures my attention, as staying energized and looking good are relevant concerns.
  - **Good**: Strongly Agree (5). I appreciate that it addresses daily needs effectively.
  - **Attractive**: Disagree (2). The messaging feels generic; more personal relevance would be needed for strong attraction.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
  - **Intend to purchase this product**: Strongly Disagree (1). My current budget constraints and skepticism about the effectiveness without concrete evidence discourage immediate intent.
  - **Will try to buy this product**: Neutral (3). Curiosity might prompt a trial, but not at full price due to cost limitations (<15,000,000 VND).
  - **Consider buying this product**: Agree (4). There is consideration for the potential benefits if it aligns with future budgetary flexibility or specific offers.

Overall, while I appreciate and find the ad appealing in terms of functionality, practical considerations like affordability make a full purchase less likely. A targeted discount or trial could sway my decision closer to intention.
