**Evaluation and Reasoning:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **Like (score = 4)** - Neutral to slightly positive; the ad's message about fatigue and dullness resonates on some level.
2. **Interesting (score = 3)** - Mildly interesting but not engaging enough due to familiarity with such health claims in similar ads.
3. **Good (score = 2)** - Disagree, as it lacks strong evidence or a compelling story that aligns closely with my skepticism about quick fixes.
4. **Attractive (score = 1)** - Strongly disagree; the ad's aesthetic and messaging seem generic without tapping into any personal values or genuine concerns.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase (score = 2)** - Disagree, as I'm highly skeptical about such claims and prioritize thorough research over advertising.
2. **Try to buy (score = 2)** - Slightly more likely than "intend," but still low; might consider a sample or trial if offered elsewhere.
3. **Consider buying (score = 3)** - Neutral, indicating I'm open to further information or proof rather than being immediately swayed by the ad.

Overall, while there is some level of acknowledgment that fatigue and appearance can be important, the advertisement fails to build strong trust due to its lack of credibility and personal relevance. Thus, my purchase intention remains low despite considering a potential trial under specific conditions.
