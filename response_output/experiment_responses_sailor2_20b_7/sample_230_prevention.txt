**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **I like the ad:** 2 (Neutral/Disagree) — The claim feels somewhat hyperbolic and lacks relatability due to my strong dislike for manipulative language.
  - **I think the ad is interesting:** 3 (Slightly Disagree/Neutral) — It doesn't grab me as intriguing; it's too focused on fear tactics.
  - **I believe the ad is good:** 4 (Agree) — While not impressive, I acknowledge that highlighting potential negative consequences can be an effective sales strategy, but it isn’t compelling to me personally.
  - **I find the ad attractive:** 1 (Strongly Disagree) — The tone feels pushy and unappealing; I prefer ads with subtler messaging.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product:** 1 (Strongly Disagree) — Given my tendency towards skepticism and the manipulative nature of the ad, there's no intention to buy.
  - **Will try to buy this product:** 1 (Strongly Disagree) — No effort will be made since it doesn't align with my trust or preference.
  - **Will consider buying this product:** 1 (Strongly Disagree) — Despite any potential benefits, the ad's presentation detracts from its appeal and credibility.

Overall, while acknowledging that such ads can work for others, I find this one particularly unconvincing and off-putting due to my personality traits and preference for authentic marketing. Therefore, it has minimal impact on my purchasing behavior.
