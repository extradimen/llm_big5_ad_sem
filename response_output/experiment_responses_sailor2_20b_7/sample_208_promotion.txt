**Detailed Evaluation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement

1. **I like the ad (Score: 6)**:
   - As a talkative and outgoing individual, I appreciate energetic messaging that resonates with my personality.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 5)**:
   - The idea of staying energized aligns well with daily life demands but needs stronger presentation to capture full attention.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 4)**:
   - It’s functional and relevant, but generic claims about looking "best" might be overpromised without supporting details.

4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3)**:
   - While I’m sociable, its visual appeal could be improved to make a stronger impact; it feels somewhat basic compared to what engages modern audiences more deeply.

### Purchase Intention

1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)**:
   - The promotion appeals but isn't compelling enough given my careful decision-making process and reserved skepticism toward health/beauty claims without concrete evidence.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)**:
   - Neutral inclination; might give it a shot due to its promise, but not actively seeking it out.

3. **I will consider buying the product (Score: 3)**:
   - There is some consideration based on potential benefits, especially if price aligns with budget (VND 36-45 million per month). However, additional assurances or personal testimonials would sway me more decisively.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad's energy and relevance to my lifestyle, it lacks compelling features that drive immediate purchase intent. It needs stronger evidence of efficacy and creativity in presentation to move from "consideration" to a strong buying decision.
