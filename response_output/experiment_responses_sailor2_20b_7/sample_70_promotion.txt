**Evaluation Explanation:**

### **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
- **Like (Score: 3)**: While not strongly opposed, I find it slightly engaging but wouldn't go out of my way to enjoy or praise it.
- **Interesting (Score: 4)**: Neutral-to-positive; the claims about energy and appearance are somewhat intriguing for a busy professional like myself.
- **Good (Score: 5)**: Generally positive as the message aligns with self-care, which is relevant. However, not entirely compelling without more substantiation or personal relevance.
- **Attractive (Score: 2)**: The ad’s aesthetics and overall appeal are lacking; it doesn't stand out enough to draw my attention.

### **Purchase Intention**
- **Intend (Score: 1)**: Strongly disagree. Despite the benefits, I don’t have a strong drive to buy this product right now.
- **Try (Score: 2)**: Somewhat agree; might give it a shot if offered at a promotional event or free sample out of curiosity but not as an active plan.
- **Consider (Score: 2)**: Neutral-to-slightly interested. I would weigh the benefits against alternatives and budget, so consideration exists under specific circumstances.

Overall, while there's acknowledgment that the drink addresses important aspects of daily life, my reserved nature combined with strong agreement towards thorough planning leads me to be cautious about immediate or enthusiastic purchase decisions. The ad’s impact is moderate at best for this profile.
