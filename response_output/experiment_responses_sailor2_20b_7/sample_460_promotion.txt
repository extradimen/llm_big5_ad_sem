**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **I like the ad**: Neutral (Score of 3) - While it isn't offensive, I don’t feel a strong positive connection.
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: Slightly Agree (Score of 4) - It sparks mild curiosity but lacks engaging content or novelty for me personally.
3. **I believe the ad is good**: Disagree (Score of 2) - The claims seem generic and unconvincing, failing to establish credibility.
4. **I find the ad attractive**: Neutral with a lean towards Disagreement (Score of 3) - Not visually or emotionally appealing enough.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product**: Strongly Disagree (Score of 1) - I lack motivation and trust in such promises.
2. **Will try to buy this product**: Strongly Disagree (Score of 1) - No compelling reasons given for taking a chance on the product.
3. **Will consider buying this product**: Strongly Disagree (Score of 1) - Given my reserved nature, extensive worry about efficacy, and lackluster ad quality, I am not inclined to even consider it.

Overall, while there’s minimal appreciation due to mild curiosity, the advertisement falls short in convincing me as a consumer with strong reservations about its credibility and relevance. Hence, low scores across attitudes and purchase intentions reflect this critical evaluation.
