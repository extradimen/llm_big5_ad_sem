  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes**:  
   - **I like the ad (score = 3)**: The appeal is mild; I find it somewhat acceptable but not particularly exciting.
   - **Interesting (score = 2)**: It doesn't grab my attention strongly, feeling rather generic.
   - **Good (score = 4)**: Neutral to slightly positive; the message seems decent enough but lacks emotional impact for me.
   - **Attractive (score = 3)**: Mildly attractive; not visually or conceptually compelling.

- **Purchase Intention**:
   - **Intend to purchase this product (score = 1)**: Strongly disagree. Given my reserved and careful nature, coupled with economic constraints despite higher income, I'm hesitant.
   - **Try to buy this product (score = 2)**: Slightly inclined; curiosity might prompt a small trial but not commitment.
   - **Consider buying the product (score = 3)**: Neutral leaning toward consideration. It fits into my lifestyle assessment as something that could be tried if other factors align.

Overall, while I appreciate the utility of energy and appearance enhancement claims, they don't strongly resonate with my personal traits or priorities. My cautious nature and need for thoroughness in decision-making lead to a low intent score but leave open the possibility of minimal exploration.
