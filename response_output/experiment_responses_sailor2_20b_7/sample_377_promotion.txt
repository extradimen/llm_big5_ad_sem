**Explanation:**

### **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad (5):** 
   - Neutral leaning towards agreeable; it appeals on a basic level but doesn't strongly resonate given my practical mindset.
  
2. **I think the ad is interesting (4):** 
   - Slightly below neutral, as everyday energy drinks are not particularly novel to me.

3. **I believe the ad is good (3.5):**
   - Generally agreeable due to its promise of staying energized and looking best, but lacks deep credibility for my cautious nature.

4. **I find the ad attractive (2.5):** 
   - Strongly disagree; being a blue-collar worker with higher concerns about practicality over superficial benefits makes it unattractive.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product (2, slightly agree)**:
   - Low intention due to prioritizing budget and utility over appearance-enhancing claims.
  
2. **I will try to buy this product (1, strongly disagree):** 
   - Given my limited income and focus on essential needs, trying a potentially non-essential item seems impractical.

3. **I will consider buying this product (1, strongly disagree)**:
   - Even considering purchasing feels out of line with my values around budget management and necessity over convenience/beauty products.

In summary, while I acknowledge the ad's messages about energy and appearance, my practicality, financial constraints, and focus on reliability outweigh any superficial appeal. Therefore, purchase intentions are low to non-existent despite a modestly positive initial reaction to its claims.
