**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
- **I like the ad (2/7):**
  - As someone who is reserved and strongly agreeable to being talkative but not particularly outgoing or sociable, I find this general promise of energy and appearance appealing only moderately.
  
- **I think the ad is interesting (3/7):**
  - The claim about staying energized has some appeal but lacks specific details that would truly grab my attention. It’s somewhat engaging, yet not extraordinary.

- **I believe the ad is good (4/7):**
  - I appreciate simplicity and straightforwardness in ads; however, without evidence or more compelling features, it feels generic rather than genuinely convincing.
  
- **I find the ad attractive (3/7):**
  - The visual aspect might be acceptable but doesn’t draw strong interest. As a reserved individual, aesthetics alone are not enough to make me feel strongly attracted.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product (1/7):**
  - Strongly Disagree: My cautious and thorough nature requires more concrete benefits or proof before making such decisions.
  
- **I will try to buy this product (1/7):**
  - Strongly Disagree: The lack of detailed information about the drink's ingredients, health claims, user testimonials, etc., makes it unlikely I'll actively seek a purchase.

- **I will consider buying this product (2/7):**
  - Neutral-Tending-to-Low: Given my emotions and preferences for practicality over allure, I might keep an open mind if more credible information surfaces in the future. However, current standing is low.

In summary, while not entirely dismissive, my reserved nature and need for substantiated claims place this ad below average on both attitude and purchase intent scales. Specifics are required to elevate interest towards action.
