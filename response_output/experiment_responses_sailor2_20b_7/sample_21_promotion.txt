**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **I like the ad. (3/7)**: While I'm talkative and generally agreeable, this claim feels a bit superficial to me—lacks depth.
  - **I think the ad is interesting. (4/7)**: Neutral interest because it's generic; energy drinks aren't particularly intriguing given my daily routine.
  - **I believe the ad is good. (2/7)**: Strongly disagree—it oversimplifies health and beauty benefits, lacking credibility for a critical mindset.
  - **I find the ad attractive. (2/7)**: Low attractiveness due to its overly optimistic claims and common marketing tropes that I've become skeptical of.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product. (1/7)**: Strongly disagree—I have reservations about making a rushed decision based on such an ad.
  - **Try to buy this product. (1/7)**: Disagree—it doesn't align with my usual careful planning and consideration of alternatives.
  - **Consider buying this product. (2/7)**: Slightly agree—there's room for curiosity, but I need more specific information or personal validation before making a purchase.

Overall, while the ad may pique mild interest due to its promises, it doesn't sufficiently resonate with my values and skepticism regarding broad claims, thus leading to low intention scores.
