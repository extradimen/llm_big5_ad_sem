**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Ad Attitude (Scores):**
   - **I like the ad:** Agree slightly, but not strongly (Score = 3). The promise of staying energized resonates with my busy life as a blue-collar worker.
   - **Interesting:** Neutral leaning towards agree (Score = 4). It catches attention because it addresses daily fatigue and appearance concerns.
   - **Good:** Slightly positive impression (Score = 5). The message is clear, but the overall design could be more engaging for my taste.
   - **Attractive:** Disagree slightly (Score = 2). While functional benefits are appealing, I find the aesthetic or persuasive elements unremarkable.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product:** Neutral leaning towards a low intention (Score = 2). The appeal doesn't drive me to commit right away due to other priorities and budget constraints.
   - **Will try to buy this product:** Considered trial but not immediate action (Score = 3). I might give it a shot if the opportunity arises or there are good discounts/promos.
   - **Consider buying this product:** Moderately inclined towards consideration (Score = 3). Despite reservations, it aligns with my need for energy and looks, so it stays on the list of options.

Overall, while the ad addresses practical needs and has some appeal due to its claims, it falls short in capturing strong enthusiasm or immediate purchase intent. The balance between work stress, financial considerations, and lifestyle choices influences this moderate evaluation.
