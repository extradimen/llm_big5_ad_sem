**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**: 
  - **I like the ad (Score: 4)**: Neutral liking; given my reserved nature and lack of strong emotional response.
  - **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 3)**: Somewhat engaging, but not particularly captivating due to a neutral social approach.
  - **I believe the ad is good (Score: 2)**: Slightly negative as I find it somewhat generic; could be more credible with specific benefits for my lifestyle and income bracket.
  - **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3)**: Modest attractiveness, not strongly drawn to its overall presentation.

- **Purchase Intention**:
  - **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)**: Strongly disagree; current financial constraints and focus on essential needs make it unlikely.
  - **Will try to buy this product (Score: 2)**: Mild interest, but not enough motivation given my limited budget for non-essential items.
  - **Will consider buying the product (Score: 3)**: Neutral; might be considered if there's a significant price drop or compelling necessity arises.

Overall, while I appreciate that the ad tries to appeal with promises of energy and appearance benefits, it does not sufficiently align with my current priorities, financial situation, and personal values. Therefore, while moderately interesting, it lacks persuasive power for an immediate purchase decision.
