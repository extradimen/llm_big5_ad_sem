**Evaluation:**

### **Ad Attitudes**
1. **Like the Ad (Score: 4)**:
   - While I appreciate its messaging of staying energized and looking good, my reserved nature means I don't feel an intense connection or excitement from it.
   
2. **Interesting (Score: 5)**:
   - The promise is intriguing to someone who values energy and appearance but not enough to be a strong personal interest.

3. **Good Ad (Score: 6)**:
   - Credibly presents benefits, especially appealing for office workers like myself needing sustained focus and vitality.
   
4. **Attractive (Score: 3)**:
   - The visual appeal might vary; while the message is decently conveyed, it feels somewhat generic rather than exceptionally engaging.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **Intend to Purchase (Score: 2)**:
   - Despite my strong agree with being helpful and unselfish, I'm not immediately compelled to buy solely from this ad.
   
2. **Will Try to Buy (Score: 3)**:
   - If recommended by peers or if the brand has a good reputation, I might give it a try due to its potential benefits.

3. **Consider Buying (Score: 4)**:
   - The features align with my needs; however, other factors such as price and existing products will also influence my decision-making process before purchasing. 

In summary, while the ad resonates moderately well and presents an appealing value proposition, it falls short of being highly persuasive for a direct purchase due to its more reserved nature and slightly generic presentation style. Consideration is on the table but not immediate intent.
