**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **I like the ad**: Neutral (3) — While it's not unappealing, my strong talkativeness and helpful nature might find its message slightly engaging.
  - **Interesting**: Agree (4) — The concept of fatigue avoidance aligns with daily concerns but lacks novelty due to similar messaging in other ads.
  - **Good**: Strongly Agree (5) — It effectively addresses a common issue, making it persuasive for health-conscious individuals like me.
  - **Attractive**: Disagree (2) — Although the message is valid, my preference leans towards more personalized and creative advertising styles.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to purchase** (3): Neutral leaning towards consideration; although I appreciate its prevention benefits, other factors influence actual buying decisions.
  - **Try to buy**: Agree (4) — The persuasive nature makes me open to giving it a try once available and contextually appropriate.
  - **Consider buying**: Strongly Consider (5) — Overall, the ad's message resonates enough for thoughtful consideration in my future purchases.

While the advertisement effectively highlights fatigue prevention concerns, personal preferences and external factors will further influence actual purchase decisions.
