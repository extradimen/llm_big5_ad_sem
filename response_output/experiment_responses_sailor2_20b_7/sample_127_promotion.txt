**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
  - **Like (score 3):** The appeal is moderate; I don't strongly dislike it but also do not find it particularly enjoyable.
  - **Interesting (score 4):** It captures some attention, though its content lacks a compelling hook for me.
  - **Good (score 5):** Given my generally trusting nature and seeking wellness products, the message seems reasonable enough to be considered good without being exceptional.
  - **Attractive (score 2):** The visual appeal is low due to my preference for more direct communication rather than flashy presentations.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend (score 1):** I'm not inclined to purchase it based on the ad alone; practicality and proven benefits are crucial.
  - **Try (score 2):** Might consider trying if recommended by a trusted source or offered as part of an experience, but low initial motivation.
  - **Consider (score 3):** There's some consideration given its promise for energy and appearance, though hesitation stems from previous mixed experiences with similar products.

In summary, the ad is moderately acceptable yet fails to strongly persuade me due to my reserved nature, lack of personal resonance, and cautious approach towards wellness claims. Hence, while open to further investigation, immediate purchase intent remains low.
