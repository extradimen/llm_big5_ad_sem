**Evaluation and Rationale:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - *Like (Neutral):* The ad appeals slightly but doesn't evoke strong feelings due to my reserved nature.
  - *Interesting (Agree):* The promise of staying energized resonates with me, particularly given the busy life of a postgraduate student.
  - *Good (Disagree):* While useful features are mentioned, I find it lacking credibility without specific details on ingredients or scientific backingâ€”this is critical for trust-sensitive consumers like myself.
  - *Attractive (Neutral):* The general tone and visuals may attract but do not strongly engage me given my tendency towards thoroughness in assessing claims.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend to Purchase (2, Neutral)*: I am cautious about making immediate decisions without more information; thus, strong intent is lacking.
  - *Try to Buy (3, Slightly Agree):* The desire for energy and well-being nudges me towards a trial purchase if it's affordable within my monthly income range of 16-25 million VND.
  - *Consider Buying (5, Agree):* Considering the product aligns with personal needs despite reservations about trustworthiness. I'd wait to gather more reviews or evidence before finalizing.

Overall, while moderately positive towards the ad's message and somewhat inclined to purchase, my careful nature and tendency for thoroughness necessitate additional research and reassurance.
