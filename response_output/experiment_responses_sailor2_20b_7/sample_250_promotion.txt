**Explanation:**

1. **Attitudinal Evaluation:**
   - **Like the Ad (5)**: I appreciate its message but feel it's somewhat generic and not entirely compelling.
   - **Interesting (4)**: It catches my attention initially due to the claims of energy and appearance enhancement, though slightly overused in ads today.
   - **Good (6)**: The ad is well-crafted with a clear value proposition; I find its presentation fairly convincing but not overwhelmingly so.
   - **Attractive (3)**: While visually appealing for most part, it doesn't resonate deeply enough to draw me significantly.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase (2)**: Given my busy schedule as a civil servant and general health-consciousness, I acknowledge the benefits but am not strongly motivated without further research.
   - **Will Try to Buy (3)**: There's enough intrigue to consider giving it a try in case of legitimate results. Trial offers or discounts might sway me more.
   - **Consider Buying (4)**: Though emotionally balanced and slightly skeptical, I remain open to the possibility if reviews validate its effectiveness.

Overall, while I appreciate the adâ€™s intent, my cautious nature and preference for thoroughness mean it falls just short of pushing a purchase commitment. The scores reflect a reasonable openness but not an immediate buying decision.
