**Detailed Evaluation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3)** - Neutral to slightly positive; I appreciate energy-boosting drinks but don't find this specific promotion particularly compelling.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)** - Agree somewhat; it offers a simple and straightforward benefit, which isnâ€™t engaging enough for me personally.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5)** - Neutral leaning positive; while not outstanding, the messaging of staying energized and looking good aligns with common health goals.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)** - Disagree slightly; lacking in aesthetic appeal or emotional connection to draw me in.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)** - Strongly disagree; my budget constraints and lack of immediate need mean I'm not inclined.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)** - Disagree slightly; despite the benefits, other priorities take precedence right now.
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3)** - Neutral leaning towards consideration; might revisit if there are significant discounts or special offers but no immediate purchase plan.

**Summary:** The advertisement is functional and aligns with general health aspirations, yet it lacks the personal resonance to motivate a strong intent to buy given my current financial situation and lifestyle priorities. Thus, while not negative, it doesn't evoke enough interest for an imminent purchase decision.
