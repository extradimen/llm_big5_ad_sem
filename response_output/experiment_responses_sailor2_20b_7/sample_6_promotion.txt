**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**  
  - **Like (Score = 2):** While the idea of staying energized is appealing, the overall presentation doesn't strongly resonate with my personal taste.
  - **Interesting (Score = 3):** The promise to look best every day has some interest but lacks depth or specific details that would hook me more deeply.
  - **Good (Score = 4):** It conveys a positive message, which is generally good. However, it doesn't inspire strong trust due to the lack of clear evidence or endorsements from credible sources.
  - **Attractive (Score = 5):** The concept aligns with daily wellness goals but isn’t exceptionally attractive compared to other alternatives I might consider.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
  - **Intend (Score = 2):** Given my cautious nature and skepticism, the ad alone does not create a strong purchase intent. 
  - **Try (Score = 2.5):** There's mild curiosity but no immediate urgency or push to try it over other products I already use.
  - **Consider (Score = 3):** It’s in the realm of consideration for future purchases, especially if there are additional compelling offers or reviews from friends and family.

In summary, though not strongly persuasive, the ad aligns with some aspects of my health-conscious lifestyle. However, further proof or endorsements would likely elevate both attitude scores and purchase intentions closer to neutral-to-positive range.
