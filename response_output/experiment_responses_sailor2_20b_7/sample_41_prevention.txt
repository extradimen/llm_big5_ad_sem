**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
  - I like the ad (Score: 3): Neutral to slightly negative; it doesn't resonate due to my reserved and sometimes rude nature.
  - It’s interesting (Score: 2): Somewhat uninteresting, as the message feels overly direct and not compelling enough for me.
  - Believes it's good (Score: 1): Strongly disagree; I lack trust in such claims about immediate energy boost or appearance improvement.
  - Attractive (Score: 4): Slightly agreeable because of its straightforwardness but overall, lacks appeal.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - Intend to purchase this product (Score: 1): Strongly disagree. The ad doesn’t align with my values and doesn't seem credible.
  - Will try to buy the product (Score: 2): Somewhat neutral; curiosity might be piqued but not enough to act on it immediately.
  - Consider buying the product (Score: 2): Neutral; I wouldn't dismiss it outright, but there's no strong motivation or confidence in its effectiveness.

Given my reserved nature and generally distrustful outlook, while the ad attempts persuasion with a clear message, it falls short of engaging me deeply enough to encourage purchase. Hence, low scores on both attitude and intent reflect this dissonance between the advertisement’s approach and my personal characteristics.
