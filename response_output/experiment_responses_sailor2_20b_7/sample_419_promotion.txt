**Explanation:**

- **Attitudinal Response to the Advertisement:** 
  - **I like the ad. (2):** Given my preference for straightforward communication and practicality, I find the message a bit generic without much emotional engagement.
  - **I think the ad is interesting. (3):** Neutral leaning towards slightly agreeable; it lacks novelty or unique features that captivate me.
  - **I believe the ad is good. (4):** Acceptable but not compelling; its claims on staying energized and looking best are common for energy drinks, lacking strong differentiation.
  - **I find the ad attractive. (5):** Slightly agree due to a basic attractiveness in promoting health benefits, though it doesnâ€™t excite me greatly.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product. (1):** Strongly disagree; while I appreciate staying healthy, my skepticism and lack of strong attraction mean I have no immediate intent.
  - **Will try to buy this product. (1):** Also strongly disagree as there's no pressing reason or incentive for me personally to take action on trying it.
  - **Consider buying this product. (2):** Neutral leaning towards slightly agree; though not a priority, if the circumstances align, such as needing an energy boost and having other positive reviews, I might give it some thought.

Overall, while the ad is mildly acceptable in terms of attitude, my purchasing intent remains low due to lackluster appeal and personal preferences. Practical benefits are acknowledged but don't drive immediate action.
