**Explanation:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
- **I like the ad (Score: 3)**: Neutral leaning towards mild liking. As someone who is outgoing but not overly talkative or reserved, I appreciate its message but don't find it exceptionally appealing.
- **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)**: Somewhat interesting. The energy and appearance benefits are relevant for daily life, but they’re a common promise that doesn’t evoke strong excitement.
- **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5)**: Neutral positive. It delivers its message effectively; however, it doesn't stand out significantly in a crowded market of similar products.
- **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)**: Low attractiveness due to my tendency towards practicality and trust issues with over-hyped claims.

### **Purchase Intention**
- **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)**: Strongly disagree. Given my financial constraints, frequent worries about spending, and skepticism of such promises, there's no strong intention to buy.
- **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)**: Neutral leaning towards a slight inclination to consider it if I had surplus funds or was in need for specific days only but not as part of regular expenditure.
- **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3)**: Mild consideration. While the benefits are attractive, they must align with my budget and other priorities before deciding.

In summary, though the advertisement is decently presented and has a good message, it doesn't significantly resonate or drive strong purchase intent due to personal financial concerns, cautious attitude towards health claims, and general preference for practical solutions over high-energy promises.
