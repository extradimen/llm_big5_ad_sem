**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like (4):** As a reserved individual with neutral sociability and a tendency to be careful in my judgments, I find the ad somewhat appealing but not overwhelmingly so.
   - **Interesting (3):** The promise of energy and looking good is intriguing, though it feels generic. Hence, it sits slightly above neutral on interest.
   - **Good (2):** While functional benefits are clear, the messaging lacks depth or unique value propositions that would elevate its quality for me personally.
   - **Attractive (3):** The visual appeal might draw attention, but my tendency towards caution keeps this score moderate.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Despite some reservations about the ad's content and style, I recognize potential utility in staying energized (Strongly Agree on thorough job). Thus, thereâ€™s a noticeable intent at level 5.
   - **Try to Buy:** Given my Strongly Agree tendency to follow through with plans, even if initially hesitant, I'm likely willing to give the product a try. This scores a solid 5 out of 7.
   - **Consider Buying:** My monthly income constraints (<15 million VND) mean affordability is crucial; while not an immediate buy, considering its benefits aligns well for long-term planning (6).

Overall, I find value in evaluating this product but remain moderately cautious and realistic about integrating it into my lifestyle.
