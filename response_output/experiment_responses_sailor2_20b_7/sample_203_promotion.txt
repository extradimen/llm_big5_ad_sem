**Evaluation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 4)** - Neutral leaning positive; it's appealing but not exceptionally so.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 5)** - Agreeable due to its promise of energy and appearance benefits, which resonates with general well-being goals.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 6)** - Strongly agree; it effectively communicates both functional value (staying energized) and cosmetic benefit (looking your best).
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3)** - Neutral leaning slightly negative; while visually appealing, it lacks a deeper emotional connection or personal relevance.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)** - Disagree; despite liking aspects of the message, there's hesitation due to budget constraints and other priorities.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 3)** - Neutral leaning negative; might consider a trial if it aligns with limited monthly income or during promotions.
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 4)** - Agreeable but moderate intent; overall, the benefits are attractive, but not compelling enough for immediate purchase.

Overall, while the ad is effective in its messaging and presentation, personal financial constraints and cautious spending habits influence a more measured approach to potential purchases. The score reflects an acknowledgment of value without strong commitment due to practical considerations.
