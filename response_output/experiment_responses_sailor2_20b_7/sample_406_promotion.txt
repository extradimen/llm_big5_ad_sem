**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Ad**:  
  - *Like (3)*: The ad resonates with me somewhat due to its focus on energy and looking good, aligning with my desire for vitality but not strongly enough to evoke strong enthusiasm. 
  - *Interesting (4)*: It piques interest because it highlights daily benefits that people care about.
  - *Good (5)*: I appreciate the message's clarity and positive tone, making me think it could be credible.
  - *Attractive (2)*: While not highly attractive, its modern messaging aligns with my preference for practical solutions over purely aesthetic appeal.

- **Purchase Intention**:
  - *Intend (4)*: Slightly higher intention as I acknowledge the need for energy boost and appearance enhancement but do not feel compelled to buy immediately.
  - *Try (3)*: Willingness to give it a try, particularly if it aligns with my budget or offers good reviews. 
  - *Consider (5)*: Definitely in consideration due to its promise of daily benefits and general appeal.

In summary, the ad is moderately compelling but requires further personal context and positive user experience before making an actual purchase decision. The high score for "consider" reflects a balanced evaluation where I find it worth exploring despite some reservations about immediate intent.
