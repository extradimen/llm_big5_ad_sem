**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
   - *I like the ad (score = 5)*: The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to my desire for personal improvement.
   - *Interesting (score = 4)*: It's mildly engaging, but not exceptionally unique or captivating.
   - *Good (score = 3.5)*: I find it somewhat persuasive due to the health benefits but could use more specific details to be fully convinced.
   - *Attractive (score = 4)*: The concept is visually appealing and resonates with my values, though not enough to make me strongly enthusiastic.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - *Intend to purchase this product (score = 2.5)*: Although I appreciate the idea, there's hesitation due to other competing brands and concerns about effectiveness.
   - *Will try to buy this product (score = 3)*: A neutral inclination toward trying once or seeing if it lives up to its claims without strong commitment.
   - *Will consider buying this product (score = 3.5)*: The ad nudges me towards considering it, particularly for its potential benefits but not enough to lead to an immediate purchase.

Overall, the advertisement has a moderate positive impact on my attitude and triggers mild consideration for purchasing, reflecting cautious interest rather than strong intent. Further information or personal experience might sway my decision more significantly.
