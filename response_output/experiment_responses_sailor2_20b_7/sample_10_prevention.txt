**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
  - **I like the ad. (Score: 2)**: The claim feels somewhat exaggerated and doesn't resonate personally.
  - **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 3)**: It has a standard appeal, but it's not particularly engaging or novel.
  - **I believe the ad is good. (Score: 4)**: Neutral to slightly agree; it conveys basic credibility without strong emotional connection.
  - **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 1)**: Strongly disagreeâ€”the message feels too generic and lacks a compelling hook for me.

- **Purchase Intention**
  - **I intend to purchase this product. (Score: 1)**: I don't have plans or strong desire based on the ad alone.
  - **I will try to buy this product. (Score: 2)**: Slightly agree; curiosity might prompt a single trial, but not commitment.
  - **I will consider buying this product. (Score: 2)**: Neutral-agree; it may come up in future purchase consideration if other factors align.

Overall, while the ad presents an effective preventive message, my reserved nature and careful approach mean I'm less likely to be swayed into immediate or frequent purchases due to its generic nature and lack of emotional appeal. The product might still warrant a trial but is not a priority based on this ad alone.
