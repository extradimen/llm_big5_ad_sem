**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like**: Neutral
     Given my reserved nature and preference for practicality, I find it neutral rather than highly engaging but not off-putting.
   - **Interesting**: Agree
     The concept of staying energized appeals to me as a blue-collar worker needing sustained energy throughout the day. It's an interesting proposition.
   - **Good**: Strongly Agree
     As someone who values health and well-being, I believe this message is positive and relevant for maintaining daily vitality.
   - **Attractive**: Neutral
     While the idea resonates, visual attractiveness or style may not strongly influence my decision due to practical concerns over efficacy.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase**: Disagree
     Although I find it interesting and believe in its benefits, cost (monthly income <15 million VND) is a significant barrier.
   - **Try to Buy**: Agree
     Given my planful nature and desire for better performance at work, I might try the product once convinced of its effectiveness through reviews or offers.
   - **Consider Buying**: Strongly Agree
     It aligns with my values and practical needs. Therefore, itâ€™s a strong consideration if budget allows after trying an initial purchase.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad's message, cost constraints make immediate purchasing unlikely but keep me open to potential trials and future acquisition.
