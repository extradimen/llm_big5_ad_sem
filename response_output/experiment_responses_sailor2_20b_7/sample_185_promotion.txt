**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like (4):** The ad seems approachable due to its straightforward message on staying energized and looking good, which is appealing.
  - **Interesting (3):** It's mildly interesting but not highly engaging for my personal context; a bit generic.
  - **Good (5):** I appreciate the positive messaging about health benefits, making it seem beneficial even if unexceptional.
  - **Attractive (2):** My reserved nature and lack of strong emotional connection make me find it slightly less attractive compared to other ads that target social appeal.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend (2):** While the message aligns with wellness goals, my financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND) and cautious spending tendencies mean I’m not likely to commit.
  - **Try (1):** Minimal incentive without a compelling offer or prior experience makes it unlikely for me to seek out this product immediately.
  - **Consider (3):** Given my generally trusting nature and the ad’s claims, there's some consideration; however, additional information on pricing, ingredients, or special offers would sway my decision more.

Overall, while I acknowledge the benefits pitched by the advertisement, practical considerations—including budget and personal preferences—reduce my immediate inclination to purchase. Hence, moderately positive but cautious attitudes toward both the ad and product intention.
