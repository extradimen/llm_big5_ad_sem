**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**  
  - **Like (3/7):** Neutral to slightly positive. The ad's straightforward message resonates with my need for energy but lacks excitement.
  - **Interesting (2/7):** Low score due to a lack of creativity or novelty in the messaging; it feels routine.
  - **Good (4/7):** Moderate agreement as the preventive aspect is valuable, especially relevant to managing fatigue and appearance concerns at this age.
  - **Attractive (3/7):** Slightly agreeable but could be more engaging with visual appeal or personal testimonials.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
  - **Intend (5/7):** While not strongly compelled, the potential benefits are appealing enough to consider buying.
  - **Try (6/7):** Given my tendency towards thoroughness and trying new solutions for fatigue, I am inclined to give it a shot.
  - **Consider (7/7):** Despite some reservations about immediate purchase intent, its relevance aligns with health-conscious decisions, making me highly likely to consider buying eventually.

Overall, the ad is effective in raising awareness of potential benefits but could enhance engagement through more dynamic presentation and personalization. My strong preference for originality and proactive problem-solving nudges a higher likelihood towards purchasing after further evaluation.
