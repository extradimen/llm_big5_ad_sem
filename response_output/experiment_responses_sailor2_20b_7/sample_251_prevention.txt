**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
   - *I like the ad:* (Score = 3) The concept of feeling tired and looking dull resonates mildly, but it doesn't spark excitement.
   - *I think the ad is interesting:* (Score = 4) It's moderately engaging as the premise is relatable for office workers like me who often experience fatigue.
   - *I believe the ad is good:* (Score = 5) The message seems effective in highlighting a common issue, making it somewhat credible and persuasive.
   - *I find the ad attractive:* (Score = 2) While not unattractive, I prefer ads with more personal connection or creative elements to truly stand out.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - *I intend to purchase this product:* (Score = 3) The concern about fatigue is real but my current financial constraints make a firm commitment uncertain.
   - *I will try to buy this product:* (Score = 4) It's worth considering if the price and benefits align with my budget and lifestyle.
   - *I will consider buying this product:* (Score = 6) The ad prompts me to evaluate it further, especially given its potential impact on daily energy levels.

Overall, while there is a moderate interest in the message conveyed by the ad, personal financial limitations and lack of strong emotional connection keep my purchase intention balanced towards consideration rather than immediate action.
