**Evaluation and Justification:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad (score = 3)**:
   - Despite being a student with some financial constraints, energy drinks are generally appealing for keeping up with daily demands. However, my reserved nature means I'm not overly enthusiastic about flashy ads.

2. **I think the ad is interesting (score = 4)**:
   - Neutral to slightly agree; it's engaging but not groundbreaking given the over-saturated market of health and energy products.

3. **I believe the ad is good (score = 2)**:
   - Slightly disagree; although it highlights important benefits, I find many similar claims unsubstantiated without more credible evidence or specific details.

4. **I find the ad attractive (score = 5)**:
   - Neutral to slightly agree; visually appealing and well-produced but doesn't deeply resonate with my cautious nature regarding such promises.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product (score = 1)**:
   - Strongly disagree; my low financial status restricts immediate purchases, especially without clear value or necessity in my current routine.

2. **I will try to buy this product (score = 2)**:
   - Disagree with a slight inclination towards trying due to occasional moments of energy needs but not as a regular expense.

3. **I will consider buying this product (score = 3)**:
   - Neutral leaning slightly positive; considering it in scenarios where I might need an extra boost, provided the price is reasonable and there's tangible evidence of benefits.

**Summary**: The advertisement appeals moderately with its energetic message but lacks sufficient traction to drive a strong purchase intent due to financial constraints, cautious nature, and preference for substantiated claims over generic promises. While open to occasional use, I am not inclined towards frequent or immediate purchases without more concrete assurances.
