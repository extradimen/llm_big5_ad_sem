**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:** 
   - **Like (Score: 3)** — I appreciate the ad's effort to address fatigue and appearance concerns but find it neutral rather than likable.
   - **Interesting (Score: 4)** — The message is engaging, tapping into common health-related worries which makes it somewhat interesting.
   - **Good (Score: 2)** — While not bad, it lacks a compelling narrative or strong evidence to be considered excellent advertising material. 
   - **Attractive (Score: 5)** — It has an element of attractiveness due to the fear-of-loss appeal but could use more visual and emotional depth.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend (Score: 2)** — Though I see its relevance, a strong intention to buy is lacking; other factors like brand trust or personal need would drive actual purchase.
   - **Try (Score: 3)** — Given my sociable nature and sometimes rudeness (reflecting impulsive behavior), there's mild curiosity but no firm commitment.
   - **Consider (Score: 4)** — The ad triggers consideration; I might weigh the product’s potential benefits, especially if aligns with my active imagination and original ideas for self-improvement. However, thorough planning isn't a strong suit.

Overall, while the ad resonates to some extent due to its relevant message, it needs stronger credibility and emotional engagement to push me towards an immediate purchase decision.
