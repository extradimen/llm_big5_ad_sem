**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Ad:** 
  - I like it (score: **4**) — Somewhat agreeable but not strongly.
  - Interesting (score: **3**) — It’s decently engaging but doesn't captivate me much.
  - Good (score: **5**) — On average, find its message acceptable and constructive.
  - Attractive (score: **2**) — Not particularly appealing; more utilitarian than enticing.

- **Purchase Intention:** 
  - I intend to purchase this product (**1**): Strongly disagree. Given my preferences for practicality over superficial products, the ad doesn't drive me to buy it.
  - Will try to buy this product (**1**): Strongly disagree. No inclination or urgency.
  - Consider buying this product (**1**): Strongly disagree. Even after weighing options, no consideration due to personal values and needs alignment.

Overall, while acknowledging its utility benefits, the ad doesn't resonate with my talkative yet reserved nature nor aligns closely enough with my priorities for energy drinks beyond mere attractiveness or emotional appeal. Thus, purchase intent remains low despite a moderately positive attitude towards it.
