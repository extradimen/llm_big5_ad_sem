**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
  - **Like the ad**: Neutral (3). The benefits mentioned appeal, but there's no strong emotional connection or excitement.
  - **Interesting**: Agree (4). It sparks curiosity about staying energized and looking good daily.
  - **Believe it’s Good**: Strongly Agree (5). The claims of being energy-boosting and confidence-enhancing resonate positively.
  - **Attractive**: Agree (4). Attracts attention due to the positive presentation, but isn't overly compelling.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to Purchase**: Neutral (2). While appreciative, immediate purchase intent is moderate given practical considerations like budget and need.
  - **Try to Buy**: Disagree (3). Direct action without further consideration doesn’t align with my cautious nature or current financial constraints.
  - **Consider Buying**: Strongly Agree (5). I'm open to purchasing it after weighing benefits against cost, considering its possible long-term impact on daily energy and appearance.

Overall, the ad is well-received but practical considerations influence lower immediate intent compared to a strong consideration for future purchase.
