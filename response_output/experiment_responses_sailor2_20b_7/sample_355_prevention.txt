**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
  - *I like the ad.* (Score: 3) — I find it somewhat appealing due to its straightforward messaging.
  - *I think the ad is interesting.* (Score: 4) — It's engaging enough but lacks novelty for me as someone who values originality.
  - *I believe the ad is good.* (Score: 5) — The message of potential fatigue and dullness resonates, making it seem effective in highlighting a real problem.
  - *I find the ad attractive.* (Score: 2) — While functional, its design or presentation isn't particularly eye-catching to me.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *I intend to purchase this product.* (Score: 3) — The ad's message is persuasive but doesn’t strongly drive a buying decision immediately.
  - *I will try to buy this product.* (Score: 3) — There’s an inclination to give it a chance, especially if the price and convenience align with my budget constraints.
  - *I will consider buying this product.* (Score: 4) — The ad prompts me to keep it in mind during future shopping decisions.

Overall, while I appreciate the effectiveness of the messaging, other aspects like design appeal or urgency fall short. My cautious yet helpful nature means that the ad earns a moderate level of consideration and interest rather than an immediate purchase commitment.
