**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
    - **I like the ad:** Neutral (Score = 4) – The concept resonates with my daily experience of needing energy boosters, but it’s not particularly exciting.
    - **Interesting:** Agree (Score = 5) – It introduces a relatable problem and suggests a solution, making it engaging.
    - **Good Quality:** Strongly Agree (Score = 6) – The message is clear and relevant; effective in addressing potential fatigue issues.
    - **Attractive:** Neutral with slight preference (Score = 3) – While the ad has credibility, its appeal could be improved for someone like me who values creativity and originality more.

- **Purchase Intention**
    - **Intend to Purchase:** Disagree but leaning toward neutral (Score = 2) – I acknowledge the benefits but need further motivation or a compelling deal.
    - **Will Try to Buy:** Neutral (Score = 2) – Might give it a try due to its effectiveness claims, especially during times of high stress or workloads.
    - **Consider Buying:** Agree (Score = 3) – It's definitely on the radar; I'll evaluate based on reviews and personal needs.

This balanced evaluation reflects my cautious yet open-to-innovation mindset. While impressed by the ad’s clarity and relevance, other factors like brand trust and potential discounts will influence a final purchase decision.
