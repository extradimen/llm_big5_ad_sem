**Evaluation:**

- **Attitudinal Response:**
    - *I like the ad.* (Score: 3) — The claim of feeling tired and looking dull is somewhat relatable but doesn’t fully resonate due to its overgeneralization.
    - *The ad is interesting.* (Score: 4) — It piques curiosity, especially for someone who values a bit of self-care, but it's not entirely captivating.
    - *I believe the ad is good.* (Score: 2) — The messaging feels slightly manipulative and lacks specific evidence to back up its claims convincingly.
    - *The ad is attractive.* (Score: 1) — It’s somewhat generic and doesn’t align with my preference for more thoughtful, nuanced advertising.

- **Purchase Intention:**
    - *I intend to purchase this product.* (Score: 2) — The ad isn't compelling enough on its own.
    - *I will try to buy this product.* (Score: 2) — Might consider a trial if the price is reasonable and there are better endorsements or reviews.
    - *I will consider buying this product.* (Score: 3) — It’s not top-of-mind, but I'm open to exploring given other factors like brand reputation or personal need.

In summary, while slightly intrigued by its preventive message, my high levels of skepticism and cautious nature pull down the overall appeal. The ad needs stronger evidence and a more tailored approach to sway me toward making an actual purchase decision.
