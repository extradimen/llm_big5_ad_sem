**Evaluation and Justification:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad**: *Neutral (3)* - While the benefits of staying energized and looking good are appealing, it doesn't resonate deeply given my reserved nature.
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: *Agree (4)* - The concept draws attention as a modern solution to daily needs.
3. **I believe the ad is good**: *Strongly Agree (5)* - The message aligns well with maintaining health and appearance, which are important values for me.
4. **I find the ad attractive**: *Disagree (2)* - Despite being visually appealing, it feels somewhat generic and lacks personal connection.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: *Strongly Disagree (1)* - Given my current priorities as a postgraduate student with specific time constraints, other commitments take precedence.
2. **I will try to buy this product**: *Neutral (3)* - It's not at the top of my list but might be considered under limited circumstances.
3. **I will consider buying this product**: *Agree (4)* - The potential benefits could make it a future option if aligned with health routines, especially due to its claimed positive effects.

Overall, while I appreciate and find value in the ad's message, practical considerations and personal preferences steer me towards neutral-to-dissenting attitudes regarding immediate purchase.
