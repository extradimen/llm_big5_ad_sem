**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
   - *I like the ad.* (Score: 4) – Neutral, slightly positive; the message resonates with me as I understand fatigue and its effects.
   - *I think the ad is interesting.* (Score: 3) – Mildly agree; it’s straightforward but not exceptionally engaging for my tastes.
   - *I believe the ad is good.* (Score: 5) – Agree; effectively communicates a common issue people face, making it credibly informative.
   - *I find the ad attractive.* (Score: 2) – Disagree; lacks visual or emotional appeal that would grab me more strongly.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - *I intend to purchase this product.* (Score: 3) – Neutral leaning towards no immediate intention, as I have my regular routines and brands.
   - *I will try to buy this product.* (Score: 3) – Slightly agree; openness for trying if it fits within budget and is available in local stores.
   - *I will consider buying this product.* (Score: 4) – Agree; the benefits are clear, so I’m open to exploring more about its effectiveness.

Overall, while I find the ad relevant and informative, it doesn’t strongly influence an immediate purchase due to moderate interest levels and my tendency towards careful decision-making. However, with further information or personal experience confirming its efficacy, there's a possibility of consideration and trial.
