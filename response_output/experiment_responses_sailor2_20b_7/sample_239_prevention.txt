**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score = 3):**
   - Neutral leaning towards slightly positive since it resonates somewhat with feeling tired and needing energy.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score = 4):**
   - Mildly interested; relatable message but not exceptionally engaging.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score = 2):**
   - Disagree slightly; feels over-simplified, targeting common fatigue without much depth or creativity.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score = 3):**
   - Neutral leaning towards mildly unattractive due to straightforward claims and potential lack of trustworthiness.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score = 1):** 
   - Strongly disagree; no immediate intention given current financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND) and other priorities.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score = 1):**
   - Strongly disagree; low likelihood due to budget limitations.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score = 2):** 
   - Mild consideration possible if the price is affordable, but not a high priority given other daily needs and limited income.

Overall, while the ad acknowledges a common issue experienced by many, it lacks sufficient appeal or trustworthiness to significantly influence my purchase behavior at this stage. Financial constraints and prioritization play key roles in my evaluation here.
