**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**  
  - Like (2): Given my reserved nature and preference for practicality over flashy advertisements, it's neutral-to-low on likability.
  - Interesting (3): It may grab some initial attention but doesn't particularly engage me deeply due to its generic nature.
  - Good (4): The concept of staying energized is valuable; however, the claim about looking best feels superficial and less relevant for my age group.
  - Attractive (3): Visually appealing elements might attract a glance initially, but overall, it doesn't captivate me strongly.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
  - Intend (1): Strongly disagree. My focus is more on practical needs than on appearance-enhancing products due to my reserved and unselfish nature.
  - Try (2): Neutral-to-low; if the product were available at a reasonable price, I might consider it but wouldn't make an immediate effort.
  - Consider (3): Low consideration level since there are other priorities with limited income. However, staying energized remains important for my health and daily tasks.

Overall, while acknowledging its benefits, this advertisement does not strongly resonate due to its alignment with less relevant interests and the perceived value compared to personal needs and financial constraints. Thus, a cautious yet slightly positive but low engagement response.
