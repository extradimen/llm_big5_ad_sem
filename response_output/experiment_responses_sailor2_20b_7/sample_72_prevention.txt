**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad:** Score of 2 (Neutral leaning toward Disagree). Although I appreciate preventive messages, this specific claim feels overemphasized and slightly exaggerated.
   - **Interesting:** Score of 3 (Agree) – The concept is familiar but lacks novelty to captivate my interest fully.
   - **Good:** Score of 4 (Slightly Agree) – It conveys a common health message effectively but could be more nuanced in its approach.
   - **Attractive:** Score of 3 (Neutral leaning toward Disagree) – While the idea is understandable, it does not appeal strongly to my reserved nature and cautious mindset.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product:** Score of 2 (Disagree). Despite acknowledging its potential benefits, I am hesitant due to concerns about effectiveness and personal inclination.
   - **Will try to buy this product:** Score of 3 (Neutral leaning toward Agree) – There's some curiosity, but practicality takes precedence over impulse purchases.
   - **Will consider buying this product:** Score of 4 (Agree) – I am open-minded enough to weigh the options if offered by a reputable brand and supported with more credible evidence.

Overall, while not strongly opposed, my balanced traits incline me toward being cautious rather than immediately drawn into purchasing decisions based on such ads. The scores reflect this nuanced perspective.
