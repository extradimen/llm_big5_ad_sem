**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad:** Disagree (Score: 3) - The ad feels generic and might not align with my preferences for a more focused or niche messaging.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Neutral to Disagree (Score: 2) - It lacks novelty, especially given its broad promise of energy and appearance benefits which I find common in many ads already out there.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** Slightly Agree (Score: 4) - While it conveys a clear message, it doesn't stand out enough to strongly convince me due to limited unique selling points or evidence backing up its claims.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Strongly Disagree (Score: 1) - The presentation feels uninspired and not visually appealing, failing to capture my attention as someone who values subtlety over flashy visuals.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Neutral Tendency (Score: 3) - Even though I'm neutral on liking the ad, the need for energy boost is relevant; however, the perceived effectiveness isn't compelling enough.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Mild Interest (Score: 2) - Given my financial constraints and lack of strong emotional connection to the brand, a trial purchase might be low priority without further incentives or testimonials.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** Neutral Consideration (Score: 2) - Although I'm open to considering it for future purchases if there are discounts or recommendations from trusted sources.

Overall, while the concept resonates with my lifestyle needs, several factors—ranging from ad presentation to personal preferences and financial situation—lead me to a moderately neutral stance without strong intention to purchase immediately.
