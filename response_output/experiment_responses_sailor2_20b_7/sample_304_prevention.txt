**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - *I like the ad.* (Score: 5) – While it's effective in grabbing attention by highlighting potential negative consequences without the product, my personal preference leans towards ads that are more engaging or relatable.
  - *I think the ad is interesting.* (Score: 4) – The message is clear but lacks a strong hook for sustained interest given my personality traits.
  - *I believe the ad is good.* (Score: 6) – It effectively communicates benefits, which aligns well with its goal of preventing tiredness and dull appearance; hence it's reasonably persuasive.
  - *I find the ad attractive.* (Score: 3) – The emphasis on negating undesirable states makes it functional rather than aesthetically appealing to me.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *I intend to purchase this product.* (Score: 2) – Although I acknowledge its preventive benefits, there's a mix of neutrality and slight hesitation due to personal traits like being cautious and not easily swayed by ads alone.
  - *I will try to buy this product.* (Score: 1) – Given my strong work ethic and thorough approach, I might consider sampling it but am less inclined to actively seek out the purchase without more compelling reasons or familiarity with similar products.
  - *I will consider buying this product.* (Score: 3) – There's a moderate level of consideration due to its potential impact on daily life. However, other factors like price point and personal health routines also play crucial roles in my final decision.

Overall, the ad is effective but not overwhelmingly persuasive for me; it earns moderate scores reflecting balanced evaluation based on both advertisement quality and individual preferences.
