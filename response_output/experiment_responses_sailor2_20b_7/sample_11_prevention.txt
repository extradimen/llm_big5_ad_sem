**Evaluation and Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - *Like* (Score 3, Neutral): While not strongly drawn in by the ad, it doesn't repel me either.
   - *Interesting* (Score 4, Agree): The concept of avoiding fatigue is engaging due to my active lifestyle and occupation demands.
   - *Good* (Score 5, Strongly Agree): I appreciate its straightforward message about maintaining energy levels and appearanceâ€”relevant for a civil servant with high responsibilities.
   - *Attractive* (Score 6, Strongly Agree): The ad's appeal is visual and relatable to my need to stay alert and presentable.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend* (Score 2, Disagree): Despite its effectiveness in messaging, the direct intention to buy isn't strong due to cost considerations within my monthly income range.
   - *Try* (Score 3, Neutral): I might give it a try if there are reasonable offers or recommendations from peers.
   - *Consider* (Score 4, Agree): The product aligns with health and energy management goals, so considering it for future use is justified.

Overall, the ad effectively communicates its benefits but falls short in compelling immediate purchase due to personal budget constraints. Its attractiveness lies more in potential long-term value rather than an impulse buy scenario.
