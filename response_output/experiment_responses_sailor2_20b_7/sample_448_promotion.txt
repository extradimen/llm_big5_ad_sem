**Detailed Evaluation:**

### **Ad Attitude Scores**
1. **I like the ad:**  
   *Score: 5 (Agree)* - The claim to stay energized resonates with my active lifestyle and desire for health, but I need more compelling reasons.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:**  
   *Score: 4 (Neutral leaning Agree)* - It piques interest momentarily due to its promise of energy boost and improved appearance, though it lacks depth.

3. **I believe the ad is good:**  
   *Score: 6 (Agree)* - The overall message seems credible; staying energized is a universal need, but specifics would strengthen this belief.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:**  
   *Score: 3 (Disagree)* - While visually appealing to some extent, it falls short in emotional connection or unique selling points for me.

### **Purchase Intention Scores**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:**  
   *Score: 2 (Somewhat Disagree)* – The ad is not persuasive enough; I need more details on ingredients, benefits, and personal testimonials before making a commitment.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:**  
   *Score: 1 (Strongly Disagree)* - Without strong confidence or urgency from the ad, there's no immediate drive for me to seek out a purchase.

3. **I will consider buying this product:**  
   *Score: 2 (Somewhat Agree)* – The concept is intriguing; if I stumble upon it in-store with good reviews and clear value propositions, consideration might increase.

In summary, while the ad has some positive attributes, especially its focus on energy and appearance appeal, there’s room for improvement to align more closely with my preferences and mitigate worries about credibility. Hence, a cautious approach towards purchasing is warranted at this stage.
