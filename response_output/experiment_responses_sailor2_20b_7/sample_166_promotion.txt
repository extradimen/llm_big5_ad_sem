**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad:** *Score 2 (Disagree)* - Given my reserved nature and preference for less overt advertising appeals, I find this type of energetic promise somewhat aggressive.
- **I think the ad is interesting:** *Score 3 (Neutral)* - The claim about staying energized resonates slightly but lacks personal engagement due to limited interest in such products.
- **I believe the ad is good:** *Score 4 (Agree)* - It aims for practical benefits, which aligns with my preference for functional solutions; however, it doesn't stand out as exceptional.
- **I find the ad attractive:** *Score 1 (Strongly Disagree)* - The high-energy presentation feels inconsistent with my reserved and emotionally stable personality.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product:** *Score 2 (Disagree)* - Despite acknowledging its practical benefits, personal habits and preferences lean towards more moderate health routines.
- **I will try to buy this product:** *Score 3 (Neutral)* - A slight curiosity exists due to staying alert demands but not strong enough for a definite commitment.
- **I will consider buying it:** *Score 2 (Disagree)* - While I might review the options, my reserved and thorough nature means any purchase decision would be cautiously evaluated after more research or recommendations from trusted sources.

Overall, while acknowledging potential utility in maintaining energy levels, this ad does not resonate strongly with my personal values and lifestyle, leading to lower intentions for immediate or frequent purchasing.
