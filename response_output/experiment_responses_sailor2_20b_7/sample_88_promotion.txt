**Evaluation and Rationale:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 2)** - Despite being generally unimpressed by overly optimistic or glossy ads, this claim about energy and appearance seems relevant for daily routines but feels slightly generic.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 3)** - It sparks a bit of interest due to its focus on staying energized, which aligns with maintaining productivity at work, though it's not groundbreaking.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 4)** - The message is clear and straightforward; however, without concrete evidence or personal experience, trust in such claims remains moderate.

4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 5)** - Visually appealing ads can grab attention briefly, but my neutral to slightly positive reaction suggests it doesnâ€™t strongly compel me.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)** - Given my low income and cautious spending habits, a lack of strong personal motivation or budget allocation makes direct intent minimal.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)** - Mild curiosity might lead me to consider trying it once but not with high priority.
  
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3)** - The idea of feeling more energized and presentable is appealing, so I'm open to considering the purchase if there's a reasonable price point or special offer.

Overall, while acknowledging its relevance in maintaining daily performance, my reservations about trustworthiness and financial constraints keep the likelihood of immediate action low. A balanced yet practical approach will guide any future decision-making regarding this product.
