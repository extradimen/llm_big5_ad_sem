**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude toward the Ad**:  
   - *Like*: Neutral (2). The energetic promise resonates somewhat, but it doesn't strongly appeal given my reserved nature.
   - *Interesting*: Disagree (3). As a more introspective and not particularly outgoing civil servant, I find this claim less engaging.
   - *Good*: Disagree (3). Though the health benefits are acknowledged, there's no strong personal endorsement due to general skepticism regarding such claims without concrete evidence.
   - *Attractive*: Slightly Agree (4). The idea of looking better is mildly attractive but not compelling enough given my reserved and somewhat nervous disposition.

- **Purchase Intention**:  
   - *Intend to Purchase*: Agree but cautious (5). I recognize the benefits for energy, but personal risk aversion means I won't rush into a purchase.
   - *Try to Buy*: Likely to try if need arises (6). Given occasional stress and work demands, it's reasonable to give it a shot if regular concerns about staying energized persist.
   - *Consider Buying*: Strongly Consider (7). Despite personal reservations, the potential positive impact aligns with my role as a civil servant needing focus and energy. Thus, I am inclined towards considering it seriously.

Overall, while not passionately drawn in by the ad, the practical benefits make it worthy of consideration, balancing cautiousness with realistic evaluation of daily needs.
