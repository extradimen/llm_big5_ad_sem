**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitudes:**
   - **Like (Score 4):** The ad is somewhat appealing due to its energy and beauty claims but doesn't fully captivate me given my generally neutral outlook on social engagement.
   - **Interesting (Score 3):** While I appreciate the messaging, it feels a bit generic; not enough novelty or creativity aligns with my strong disagreement in having an active imagination or being original.
   - **Good (Score 5):** The product promise is decent. It's credible for helping energy and appearance, but thereâ€™s room for better detail to resonate more strongly.
   - **Attractive (Score 2):** I find the ad less visually or conceptually attractive because my reserved nature means I'm not drawn in by flashy promotion alone.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend (Score 6):** Despite some reservations, there's a strong inclination to buy since it aligns with wanting help staying energized and looking good.
   - **Try (Score 7):** My tendency towards following through on plans makes me more likely to give the product a try based on its appeal.
   - **Consider (Score 6):** While considering buying, I'm mindful of my tendencies toward carelessness. Still, given it addresses key needs and my positive outlook on trying new things, it rates highly.

Overall, while I have some critical views due to personal traits like reservation and emotional stability, the ad is persuasive enough to motivate a purchase intention based on practical benefits.
