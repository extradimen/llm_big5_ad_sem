**Explanation and Analysis:** 

- **Attitude Toward Advertisement**: 
  - **Like (5)**: While not strongly drawn in, I appreciate that it aligns with common wellness goals.
  - **Interesting (4)**: The idea of staying energized is relevant but doesn't captivate intensely due to neutral sociability and reserved nature.
  - **Good (3)**: Feels adequate for its purpose; could be more compelling if backed by specific benefits or credible endorsements.
  - **Attractive (2)**: Not visually or emotionally engaging enough, especially given my strong reservation trait.

- **Purchase Intention**:
  - **Intend (1)**: My reserved and somewhat untrusting nature initially lowers the immediate purchase intent.
  - **Try (3)**: Given its functional claim, I'm open to giving it a trial run, particularly if energy levels are an issue in my daily life.
  - **Consider (4)**: It will remain on my radar for future needs; this score reflects a balanced mix of cautious optimism and practical utility.

In summary, while the ad resonates at some level due to its relevance to staying energized, personal traits like being reserved and emotionally stable influence lower engagement scores. The purchase intent is moderate with consideration given primarily for occasional use when needed.
