**Evaluation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like**: *Score: 6*
   - As a talkative and socially engaged individual, I appreciate promotional content that speaks directly to maintaining energy levels and personal appearance; hence, it resonates positively but not strongly.
   
2. **Interesting**: *Score: 5* 
   - The message is straightforward and appealing for someone balancing studies (my occupation), yet the creativity or uniqueness of its presentation could be more engaging.

3. **Good**: *Score: 4*
   - I trust helpful products that claim to improve my daily routine, but without detailed information on efficacy, it's moderately convincing rather than strongly good.
   
4. **Attractive**: *Score: 3*
   - The simplicity of the ad makes it accessible but lacks emotional depth or visual appeal for strong attraction.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase**: *Score: 2 (Disagree)*
   - While I appreciate the concept, there's no immediate need driving me; academic focus often prioritizes budget-conscious decisions over supplementary beverages.
   
2. **Try to buy**: *Score: 1 (Strongly Disagree)*
   - Given my financial constraints and lack of urgency, trying this product feels unnecessary without compelling reasons or discounts.

3. **Consider buying**: *Score: 2*
   - There is a slight consideration due to the promise of energy boost and appearance benefits, but additional research or clearer value propositions would sway me further.

Overall, while I find aspects appealing (energy, looks), current conditions limit my immediate interest in purchasing this product. More tailored incentives or detailed proof could enhance its appeal for someone like myself.
