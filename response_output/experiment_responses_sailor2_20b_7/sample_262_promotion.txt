**Detailed Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (5)
   - While I appreciate its positive message about energy and appearance, my slightly nervous disposition sometimes makes me hesitant to fully embrace such marketing claims.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (4)
   - It's engaging because it promises practical benefits that many people desire—staying energized and looking good. However, the appeal isn't overwhelming due to personal biases about health product efficacy.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Strongly Agree (6)
   - The message aligns with my values of helping others look their best, especially when paired with energy benefits. As a thorough and diligent person, I appreciate clear statements on wellness improvements.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** Neutral (3)
   - Although visually appealing visuals might draw attention initially, my natural skepticism means it doesn't hold strong allure without substantial evidence or personal connection to past experiences.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Disagree (2)
   - Given my monthly income range and budget-conscious mindset, I’m cautious about new products. While the idea is appealing, practical considerations weigh heavily against immediate intent.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** Strongly Disagree (1)
   - My tendency not to act impulsively combined with nervousness means trying out a product on a whim isn't likely without more research or trust in reviews/recommendations from trusted sources.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** Neutral/Disagree Tilted Toward Consideration (3)
   - If I receive positive feedback, see it used by friends, or notice credible endorsements, the thought of purchasing might shift to consideration. But at present, it's not a priority item for me.

In summary, while finding aspects of the ad appealing and believing in its merits, my practical nature and cautious mindset currently steer me away from immediate purchase intent but keep an open mind towards future considerations based on further validation or personal experience.
