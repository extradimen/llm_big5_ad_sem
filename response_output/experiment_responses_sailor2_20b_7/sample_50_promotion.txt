**Evaluation and Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad (5/7):** While I appreciate its energetic tone aimed at helping me stay active and look good daily, it feels a bit too generic.
   - **Interesting (4/7):** The promise is somewhat compelling but lacks unique selling points to capture my full attention.
   - **Good (6/7):** It conveys positive outcomes effectively, aligning with maintaining health and appearance—values I care about. However, it could use more detailed benefits or testimonials for higher credibility.
   - **Attractive (3/7):** The visual appeal may be lacking; a clear, engaging design would make the ad much more attractive.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product (2/7):** Despite my favorable view of maintaining energy and appearance, no immediate need or strong brand loyalty exists.
   - **Will try to buy this product (3/7):** I'm open to trying it if offered at a reasonable price point or with a special offer that aligns with my budget concerns ($26M–$35M VND per month).
   - **Consider buying the product (4/7):** The ad nudges me towards consideration, especially given its emphasis on daily benefits. However, additional research and reviews would be crucial before making a decision.

In summary, while I appreciate the message and align with the values promoted, further details and personal relevance are necessary to turn potential interest into an actual purchase. Overall, this advertisement is moderately persuasive but needs refinement for higher engagement and conversion rates.
