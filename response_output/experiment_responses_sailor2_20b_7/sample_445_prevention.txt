**Evaluation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores (7-point scale)**:
    - I like the ad (Score: **3**: Neutral)
        - While somewhat agreeable due to its straightforward message about fatigue and appearance, it doesnâ€™t particularly resonate emotionally.
    - The ad is interesting (Score: **4**: Agree)
        - It presents a clear need that many can relate to, making it attention-grabbing but not overly engaging for me personally.
    - I believe the ad is good (Score: **5**: Strongly Agree)
        - Its message is well-articulated and relevant; simplicity in conveying health benefits earns points from my logical standpoint.
    - I find the ad attractive (Score: **2**: Disagree)
        - The aesthetic appeal feels standard, lacking uniqueness or strong visual impact to captivate me as an individual.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores**:
    - Intent to purchase this product (Score: **3**: Neutral)
        - Though acknowledging its practicality, my current financial situation and other health habits influence a neutral stance.
    - Will try to buy the product (Score: **3**: Agree)
        - The potential benefit aligns with maintaining vitality but doesn't trigger an immediate impulse given limited budget constraints.
    - Consider buying the product (Score: **4**: Strongly Agree)
        - I view this as a viable option for future purchase, provided it fits within my financial planning and health goals.

In summary, while the ad is effective in delivering its message, there's room for improvement to make it more compelling. My intention leans towards considering the product seriously, aligning with practicality over immediate impulse buy due to personal preferences and economic factors.
