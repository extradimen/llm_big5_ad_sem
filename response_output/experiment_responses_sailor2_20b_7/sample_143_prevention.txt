**Evaluation and Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitudes:** 
   - *I like the ad (score = 4):* While I appreciate its straightforward message about preventing fatigue, it’s not particularly engaging to me.
   - *Interesting (score = 3):* The claim is clear but lacks novelty; thus, it's mildly interesting.
   - *Good (score = 5):* It effectively communicates a relevant issue—feeling tired—a common concern for many. However, its execution could be improved.
   - *Attractive (score = 2):* Not very attractive as the ad relies heavily on fear of looking dull rather than building an emotional connection.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend to purchase this product (score = 4):* Though I recognize its potential benefits, my reserved nature makes me hesitant without further research or trust-building.
   - *Try to buy this product (score = 5):* Curiosity is piqued enough for a trial; practicality outweighs initial skepticism.
   - *Consider buying this product (score = 6):* The ad resonates with my need for energy and alertness, pushing me towards serious consideration.

Overall, while the advertisement effectively addresses a personal issue, its lack of emotional appeal and originality keeps it from being highly compelling. Nevertheless, practical benefits drive moderate to high purchase intent.
