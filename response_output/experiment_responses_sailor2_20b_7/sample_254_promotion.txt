**Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **I like the ad:** Agree (score of 4)
   - While I appreciate its aim to energize and enhance appearance, it feels too generic.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Neutral-leaning Agree (score of 5)
   - The promise of staying energized resonates somewhat, but lacks specific details or unique selling points.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Disagree (score of 3)
   - It falls short in compelling me with concrete benefits and evidence; feels more like a vague claim.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** Neutral-leaning Strongly Disagree (score of 2)
   - The visuals might be appealing, but overall attractiveness is undermined by its lack of substance.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (score of 1)
   - Based on my preferences for thoroughness and trust in specifics, I won't commit without more credible information.
   
2. **Will try to buy this product:** Strongly Disagree (score of 1)
   - There's no urgency or personal relevance driving me to take action despite liking the concept.

3. **Consider buying the product:** Neutral-leaning Agree (score of 2)
   - While not dismissive, I'm open to further exploration but won't actively pursue it at this stage due to minimal persuasive impact.

**Overall,** while some aspects are moderately engaging, the ad fails to persuade given its lack of detail and personalized appeal. Consequently, my purchase intention remains low despite an initial inclination towards staying energized and looking good. Additional substantiation would be crucial for altering these scores positively.
