**Detailed Evaluation:**

### **Ad Attitude Scores:**
- **I like the ad:** **2 (Strongly Disagree)** - The message feels too generic and doesn't resonate with my personal interests or lifestyle.
  
- **I think the ad is interesting:** **3 (Disagree)** - While it aims to evoke concern, its language lacks creativity, making it less engaging for me.

- **I believe the ad is good:** **4 (Neutral)** - It gets across a common need but doesn't persuade on an emotional or personal level.

- **I find the ad attractive:** **3 (Disagree)** - The imagery and messaging are unremarkable; they donâ€™t attract my attention positively.

### **Purchase Intention Scores:**
- **I intend to purchase this product:** **1 (Strongly Disagree)** - Given my cautious nature and preference for thoroughness, I would need more compelling evidence or a strong reason linked to health/energy concerns.

- **I will try to buy this product:** **1 (Strongly Disagree)** - The ad lacks the credibility and personal relevance necessary to motivate me into trying it out.

- **I will consider buying this product:** **2 (Disagree)** - Despite my carelessness tendency, I still prioritize informed decisions. Unless there's more detailed information or a trusted recommendation, consideration is low.

Overall, while understanding the need for energy drinks in some contexts, neither the ad nor its presentation align with my values and preferences sufficiently to spark interest or action. Hence, both attitude toward the advertisement and purchase intention are negatively influenced.
