**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **I like the ad:** (Score = 3)
   - While I appreciate energetic and confidence-boosting messages, my reserved nature doesn't strongly connect with overly enthusiastic or flashy ads.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score = 4)
   - The concept of staying energized resonates a bit more but remains somewhat neutral for me given my preference towards practical solutions over hyped-up promises.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score = 5)
   - This score reflects that I find it effective in addressing common needs, yet its credibility could be better established with concrete evidence or testimonials.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score = 2)
   - The visual and messaging may not appeal to my taste due to perceived superficiality; hence, attractiveness is quite low for me.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score = 1)
   - Given my careful nature and tendency towards thoroughness, I require more concrete assurances about the drink's effectiveness before making a firm intention to buy.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score = 1)
   - My high level of skepticism means trying it without substantial reassurance is unlikely; thus, low intent to take an initial action.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score = 3)
   - I am open to considering the option in future if backed by reviews or additional information that aligns with my cautious approach and needs for daily energy management. 

Overall, while there's some interest due to functional benefits, credibility is crucial, and a stronger connection is needed before moving toward actual purchase consideration.
