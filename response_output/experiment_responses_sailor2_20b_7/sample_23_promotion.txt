**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** 
   - **Like (Score 4):** Neutral leaning towards slightly positive; the ad's message resonates with staying energized and looking good, which aligns partially with my daily needs.
   - **Interesting (Score 3):** Slightly agreeable; it captures attention but doesn't excite me intensely due to familiarity with similar promises in other products.
   - **Good (Score 5):** Agree; the ad presents a clear benefit and seems well-executed, even if slightly generic.
   - **Attractive (Score 4):** Neutral leaning towards positive; visually appealing aspects draw my eye but not strongly enough for significant appeal.

- **Purchase intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase:** Score 2 (Disagree); though the benefits are good, my current routine and financial considerations prevent strong intent.
   - **Will try to buy:** Score 3 (Neutral leaning towards agree); might consider giving it a shot if I have some downtime or feel particularly motivated by needing more energy boost.
   - **Consider buying:** Score 3 (Agree); the product is on my radar for future use, especially during times of increased stress or busy schedules.

Overall, while the ad effectively communicates its benefits and holds moderate appeal, personal habits, budget constraints, and a slight preference against being overly impulsive keep purchase intentions in check.
