**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - *I like the ad.* (2): Neutral—The catchphrase sounds generic, and my preference for honesty makes it difficult to feel strongly positive.
   - *It’s interesting.* (3): Slightly Agree—I appreciate energy drinks but need more unique selling points beyond standard claims.
   - *It's good.* (4): Somewhat Agree—While the concept of being energized is appealing, it lacks a strong emotional or personal connection for me.
   - *I find it attractive.* (5): Moderate Agreement—the visual and messaging effort might draw attention, but not enough to sway decisively.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend to purchase:* (2) Neutral—My tendencies toward being uncommitted and somewhat careless mean I don't have a strong drive for immediate purchase.
   - *Will try to buy:* (3) Somewhat Agree—I might give it a shot, especially if the price aligns with my budget, but not without further consideration.
   - *Consider buying:* (4) Agree—There's potential interest due to needing energy boosts and looking good; however, other factors like reviews or personal experiences would push me closer to making an actual purchase.

Overall, while mildly interested and slightly attracted by the ad, stronger motivation based on practical needs and trustworthiness is required for a firm decision.
