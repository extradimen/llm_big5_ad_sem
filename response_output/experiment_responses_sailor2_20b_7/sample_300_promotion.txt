**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitude toward the advertisement:**
   - **Like (score: 3)**: While not strongly negative or positive, I find it somewhat engaging given my need for energy-boosting solutions.
   - **Interesting (score: 4)**: The promise of staying energized and looking good is appealing to me since it addresses both productivity and personal appearance concerns.
   - **Good (score: 5)**: Neutral-to-positive evaluation; the message seems straightforward and relevant, though not groundbreaking.
   - **Attractive (score: 3)**: Though I appreciate functional benefits, I find the presentation somewhat generic rather than highly attractive.

2. **Purchase intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase**: Score of `2` indicates a mild inclination but no strong commitment due to mixed feelings about brand credibility and other existing options.
   - **Try to buy**: Similar score (`2`) reflecting an open mind towards trying, given the ad's claims align with my needs, yet lacking compelling uniqueness.
   - **Consider buying**: Score of `4` denotes a higher likelihood of considering it since health-conscious choices fit within my lifestyle and financial capacity. However, other factors like reviews or brand reliability would significantly influence the final decision.

Overall, while I appreciate the targeted messaging for staying energized and looking good, additional aspects (like personalized testimonials or stronger product differentiation) could enhance its appeal to me as a consumer with specific personality traits and needs.
