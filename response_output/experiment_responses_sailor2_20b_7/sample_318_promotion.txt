**Evaluation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (score: 6)** - The slogan appeals to my desire for energy and looking good daily, which resonates with a young professional's lifestyle.
2. **It is interesting (score: 5)** - While it piques curiosity about its efficacy, I need more specific details or evidence.
3. **I believe the ad is good (score: 5)** - The messaging seems positive and relevant to my busy routine but feels somewhat generic without concrete benefits.
4. **The ad is attractive (score: 4)** - Visual appeal could be stronger; a bit too formulaic given today's dynamic marketing standards.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (score: 3)** - While the idea aligns with my goals, strong intention hinges on reviews and personal experiences.
2. **I will try to buy this product (score: 2)** - Minimal likelihood of trying it unless convinced by peers or substantial promotional offers.
3. **I will consider buying this product (score: 4)** - I'm open-minded but cautious; additional information like ingredients, user testimonials, and effectiveness data would sway my decision.

In summary, while the ad evokes interest and aligns with aspirational goals, it needs more robust support to convert intent into action. The balance of talkative yet critical tendencies leaves me moderately inclined toward considering purchase rather than immediate commitment.
