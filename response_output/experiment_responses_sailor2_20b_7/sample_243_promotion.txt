**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude:**  
  - **I like the ad**: Neutral/Agreeable score of 3. The promotion seems okay but not particularly exciting.
  - **Interesting**: Slightly above neutral at a 4, as it captures attention with its promise of energy and appearance benefits.
  - **Believe it's good**: Somewhat agree (score of 5), given my generally trusting nature; the claims seem credible enough.
  - **Attractive**: Only score of 2 due to reservations about overly promotional language.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
  - **Intend to purchase immediately** (1, Strongly Disagree): Despite believing in its benefits, I am not moved enough by this ad alone and lack the motivation to buy right now.
  - **Try to buy**: Neutral-leaning towards agreement (3), as it's worth considering if available near me or during future needs for energy boosters.
  - **Consider buying** (4, Agree): Though slightly hesitant due to personal habits of carelessness and nervousness, I am open to giving this product a thought when needed.

Overall, while the ad is moderately appealing with its promises, my cautious nature and current lifestyle factors lead me to not rush into an immediate purchase but keep it on the radar for future consideration.
