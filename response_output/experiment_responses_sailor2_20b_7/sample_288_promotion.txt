**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (Score: 4)**: While I appreciate the effort to convey energy and vitality, it feels a bit too generic.
   - **Interesting (Score: 5)**: The concept of staying energized is intriguing for someone my age who values productivity at work. However, the claims could be more specific.
   - **Good (Score: 6)**: It appears well-designed with clear messaging but doesn't resonate deeply due to lack of personal relevance or emotional connection.
   - **Attractive (Score: 3)**: The visual appeal is okay, but it doesn’t capture my attention strongly enough compared to other daily priorities.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase**: Despite some interest, I'm hesitant given limited trust in quick fixes and product effectiveness without solid testimonials or personal stories (Score: 2).
   - **Will Try to Buy**: Curiosity might lead me to check reviews before committing; my thorough approach means careful consideration is required (Score: 2).
   - **Consider Buying**: The idea aligns with my desire for energy, but other budget priorities take precedence without compelling evidence or discounts that fit within my income bracket ($360,000–450,000 VND/month) (Score: 3).

Overall, the ad sparks interest but falls short on building a strong connection due to its lack of specificity and emotional depth for someone with my demographic profile and personality traits. Therefore, while somewhat positive, it doesn't drive an immediate purchase decision.
