**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude:** 
  - Neutral on liking the ad due to its straightforward messaging.
  - Disagreed with finding it interesting because my reserved and sometimes cautious nature didn't engage well.
  - Strongly disagreed that the ad is good, as it seems superficial compared to my practical lifestyle and focus on essential needs.
  - Disagree on attractiveness; not resonating visually or emotionally given its generic appeal.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - Strongly disagree with intending to purchase because of my prioritization towards basic necessities over energy drinks.
  - Strongly disagreed with trying the product due to a lack of compelling benefit in my daily life, especially without tangible long-term benefits.
  - Similarly, I strongly disagree with considering buying it since other expenditures and obligations take precedence.

Overall, while the advertisement might not be offensive or poorly crafted, its message fails to resonate deeply enough to influence my blue-collar lifestyle, priorities, and cautious attitude towards purchasing decisions. Hence, a low score across both sections.
