**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:** 
    - **Like (2):** While the ad has a straightforward message about preventing tiredness and dull appearance, it doesn't particularly appeal to my personal taste.
    - **Interesting (3):** It is mildly interesting because everyone can relate to feeling fatigued or looking less than their best. However, it lacks novelty for me personally.
    - **Good (4):** The ad seems to convey a clear benefit and potential issue that many people face. Hence, I find the messaging decent but not outstanding.
    - **Attractive (3):** Despite its utility, my neutral-to-positive stance on appearance isn't strongly triggered by this appeal alone.

- **Purchase Intention:**
    - **Intend to Purchase:** Given my budget constraints and other priorities, the low-cost incentive of a potential energy boost doesn't rank high enough for an immediate purchase.
    - **Try to Buy:** There's some consideration because fatigue is relevant; however, hesitation around cost efficacy makes it less likely.
    - **Consider Buying:** Overall, I'm open-minded but not convinced strongly. Further information or personal need might sway me more towards considering the product in future scenarios.

The balance between my personality traits (outgoing and careful) along with practical financial constraints influences these scores. While understanding its benefits, immediate intent to buy remains low due to budget limitations.
