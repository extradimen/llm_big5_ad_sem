**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - I like the ad (score=3): Neutral leaning towards slightly positive; it doesn't strongly appeal but is acceptable.
   - I think the ad is interesting (score=4): It has a moderate level of interest, enough to keep me engaged briefly.
   - I believe the ad is good (score=5): The messaging seems reasonable and decently crafted, though not compelling.
   - I find the ad attractive (score=2): This aspect feels quite low; it lacks an appealing visual or emotional draw for someone with my reserved nature.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - I intend to purchase this product (score=3): Neutral leaning towards mildly positive. The claim is relevant, but trust and perceived value don't fully convince me.
   - I will try to buy this product (score=2): Low intention due to hesitation about its true efficacy for my needs.
   - I will consider buying the product (score=3): While not strongly motivated, it's on my radar, considering future purchase if circumstances align.

Overall, while the ad is decent and informative, it lacks the persuasive power needed given my reserved nature and practical approach. The attractiveness score particularly highlights a lack of immediate engagement for me as an older Southeast Asian male with conservative tendencies. However, I still keep an open mind to its potential benefits if recommended or tested by others.
