**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (3)**: The ad is somewhat appealing because it directly addresses a common feeling of tiredness and dull appearance, which resonates with my daily experience.
   - **Interesting (4)**: It catches attention by using relatable concerns, but the straightforward message could use more creativity to fully engage me.
   - **Good (2)**: While effective in its simplicity, it feels slightly manipulativeâ€”highlighting potential negative states rather than showcasing positive benefits directly.
   - **Attractive (5)**: The ad is moderately attractive due to its clear focus on solving fatigue-related issues. However, the emotional appeal could be stronger for a higher score.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend (3)**: I'm not strongly inclined to purchase immediately because it lacks additional compelling information about specific benefits or personal endorsements.
   - **Try (3)**: While it nudges me towards curiosity, the perceived value might push me to test it once out of convenience rather than strong conviction.
   - **Consider (4)**: Given my tendency for thoroughness and careful decision-making, I would definitely consider this product if offered in stores or online. The moderate score reflects cautious optimism.

In summary, while the ad effectively communicates a problem, its execution could be enhanced to better align with my values of reliability and creative engagement. This influences both interest levels and eventual purchase decisions but leaves room for consideration without immediate commitment.
