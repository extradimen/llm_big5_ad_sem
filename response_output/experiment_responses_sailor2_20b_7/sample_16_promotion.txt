**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like (3)** - I find it pleasant but not exceptionally engaging.
2. **Interesting (4)** - It has a moderate level of appeal in conveying its message.
3. **Good (5)** - The ad appears well-crafted, though it doesn't strongly resonate with me personally.
4. **Attractive (2)** - While visually decent, I donâ€™t find it particularly appealing to my tastes.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend (1)** - Given the product claim and lack of direct relevance to my current lifestyle, there's no strong intent to purchase immediately.
2. **Try (2)** - A bit curious but not enough to actively seek out a trial; might consider it under specific circumstances.
3. **Consider (3)** - Open-minded if faced with an opportunity or special offer, considering the low price threshold of my income.

**Summary:** While I appreciate aspects of the ad and acknowledge its well-executed promotion strategy, personal values such as being reserved and practical about expenses make me cautious rather than enthusiastic about making a purchase. The advertisement holds mild interest but falls short in sparking strong intention to buy or try immediately for someone like myself.
