**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
- **I like the ad. (Score: 4)**: While I appreciate its energetic and positive message, it doesn't resonate strongly with me due to my reserved nature.
- **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 5)**: The idea of staying energized appeals but falls slightly short in captivating my attention given my personal preferences.
- **I believe the ad is good. (Score: 6)**: As an office worker, I value efficiency and wellness; thus, the promise to look best every day feels reasonably credible.
- **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 3)**: The visual and messaging might not be visually striking enough for me to feel strongly drawn.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
- **Intend to purchase this product. (Score: 2)**: Despite positive aspects, my cautious nature and neutral job satisfaction mean I'm unlikely to make an immediate commitment.
- **Will try to buy this product. (Score: 1)**: Disagreement with being unselfish means the need for personal benefits isn't pressing enough to attempt a purchase actively.
- **Consider buying it in future. (Score: 3)**: It's on my radar due to its potential utility, but I'll wait and observe more before making an actual decision.

This balanced evaluation reflects a pragmatic outlook influenced by both personality traits and daily priorities.
