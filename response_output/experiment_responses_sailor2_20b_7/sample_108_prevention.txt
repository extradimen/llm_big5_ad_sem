**Evaluation Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like:** Neutral (3): While the ad captures my attention due to its straightforward messaging, it doesn’t particularly excite me.
  - **Interesting:** Agree (4): The concept of feeling tired and looking dull is relatable; thus, I find it somewhat interesting.
  - **Good:** Disagree (2): As a civil servant with high stress but limited disposable income, the ad feels more like an attempt at fear-mongering than providing real value or credible advice.
  - **Attractive:** Neutral (3): The presentation is clear and direct, though not engaging enough to make it stand out.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend:** Strongly Disagree (1): Given my monthly income constraints and the lack of strong personal appeal in the ad's messaging, I have no immediate intention to buy.
  - **Try:** Disagree (2): Even though considering the effects mentioned, trying it is not a high priority due to budget limitations and doubts about its effectiveness.
  - **Consider:** Agree (4): Despite reservations, there’s some acknowledgment that addressing fatigue and appearance might be beneficial; thus, I keep an open mind but won't rush into purchasing. 

Overall, while understanding the ad's target concerns, it lacks strong resonance with my personality traits and financial situation, leading to a cautious consideration without high purchase intent.
