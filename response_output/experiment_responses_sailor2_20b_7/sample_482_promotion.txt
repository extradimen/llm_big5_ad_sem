**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad**: Neutral to mildly positive (score of 4). The concept seems appealing on paper but doesn't strongly resonate with me.
2. **Interesting:** Slightly interesting due to energy and appearance benefits (score of 3).
3. **Good:** Credibility is somewhat lacking; it feels too generic without specific evidence or details (score of 2).
4. **Attractive:** Attracts attention, but not enough to spark strong interest (score of 5).

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: Strongly disagree (score of 1). Given my reserved nature and tendency towards thoroughness, I would seek more substantial evidence.
2. **I will try to buy this product**: Slightly open to trying due to curiosity about the benefits but not compelled enough (score of 2).
3. **I will consider buying it**: Willingly considering if further information or reviews justify a purchase (score of 3).

Overall, while I appreciate energy and appearance-focused products, my reserved nature, combined with skepticism regarding generic claims, reduces immediate intent to buy without more compelling proof or feedback from others.
