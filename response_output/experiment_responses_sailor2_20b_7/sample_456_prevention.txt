**Evaluation:**

### Attitudes Toward the Advertisement:

1. **I like the ad (Score: 3)**:
   - Neutral leaning towards a mild dislike due to its directness and potentially manipulative tone.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)**:
   - Somewhat engaging but not captivating; more focused on fear-based messaging rather than appealing creativity.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5)**:
   - Decent persuasion strategy, though it lacks a genuine connection to personal values and lifestyle concerns.

4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)**:
   - Not visually or emotionally compelling; feels somewhat generic for its target demographic.

### Purchase Intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)**:
   - Strongly disagree because it doesn't resonate with my personality traits (reserved, unselfish focus), and the appeal is too superficial.

2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 3)**:
   - Neutral-leaning toward unlikely; I'm open to considering new options but not driven enough by its fear-based message alone.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 2)**:
   - Mild consideration only if there are other factors like recommendations from trusted sources or specific needs addressed beyond fatigue and appearance.

Overall, while the advertisement is somewhat effective in raising awareness about potential issues, it doesn't connect deeply with my values as a reserved, unselfish civil servant living conservatively within Southeast Asia. The purchase intention remains low due to insufficient alignment between product appeal and personal preferences.
