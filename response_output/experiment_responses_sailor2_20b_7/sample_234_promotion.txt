**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **I like the ad. (Score = 3)**: While I appreciate its intention to keep people energized and look their best, it feels a bit too generic and doesn't resonate strongly with my daily concerns.
  - **I think the ad is interesting. (Score = 4)**: There's some intrigue due to the promise of energy and appearance improvement but not enough to make me genuinely excited.
  - **I believe the ad is good. (Score = 5)**: It conveys a positive message, so I find it decently credible from an informational standpoint.
  - **I find the ad attractive. (Score = 2)**: The overall design and messaging donâ€™t capture my attention; they seem more targeted towards younger demographics.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **I intend to purchase this product. (Score = 1)**: Given my budget constraints ($<15,000,000 VND) and the generic nature of the claim, I'm unlikely to make a strong commitment.
  - **I will try to buy this product. (Score = 2)**: There's some mild curiosity but not enough motivation due to cost concerns and other priorities.
  - **I will consider buying this product. (Score = 3)**: While not enthusiastic, I might think about it if circumstances align or promotions are offered.

Overall, the ad has a mixed impact on me; while interesting conceptually, its attractiveness is limited, and purchase intent remains low due to practical considerations.
