**Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitude

1. **I like the ad:**  
   *Score: 4* - I appreciate a clean and energizing message but it doesn't resonate strongly with my personality traits.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:**  
   *Score: 3* - While not captivating, it does grab attention for its promise of energy and appearance improvement.

3. **I believe the ad is good:**  
   *Score: 2* - It feels a bit generic; I look for more substance in ads given my preference for thoroughness.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:**  
   *Score: 5* - The visual appeal and energy boost claims are moderately engaging, fitting with occasional self-care needs.

### Purchase Intention

1. **I intend to purchase this product:**  
   *Score: 3* - Neutral interest; itâ€™s not a high priority but might be considered if I need extra energy.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:**  
   *Score: 1* - Low likelihood given my tendency towards carelessness and existing budget constraints.

3. **I will consider buying this product:**  
   *Score: 2* - Mild consideration, but not a strong commitment due to the lack of compelling personal connection or urgency in my daily routine.

Overall, while I find aspects attractive and believe the ad is somewhat effective, my moderate-to-low scores reflect practicality over emotional influence. My reserved nature and prioritization of budget constraints keep purchase intentions low despite occasional interest in energy drinks.
