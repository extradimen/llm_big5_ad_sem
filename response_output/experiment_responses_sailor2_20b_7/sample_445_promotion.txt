**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
- **Like:** I find the ad somewhat appealing due to its energy and appearance claims, but it's not strongly liked.
- **Interesting:** Neutral as while engaging in terms of staying energized, there isn't enough novelty or relatability for me (20â€“29 age group).
- **Good:** Disagree; lacks depth on benefits that directly connect with my needs (e.g., specific health aspects, cost-effectiveness).
- **Attractive:** Strongly Agree because it visually and verbally positions the drink as beneficial for daily life.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend to purchase:** Strongly Disagree. The appeal isn't strong enough given personal traits (careless tendencies) and financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND/month).
- **Try to buy:** Neutral. Though I see the potential benefits, other priorities and budget limitations make it a secondary consideration.
- **Consider buying:** Agree. Given its attractiveness and some perceived value, it's still on my radar but not at top priority.

This balance of critical evaluation reflects both engagement with the ad and practical considerations in purchasing decisions.
