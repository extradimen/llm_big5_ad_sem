**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 4)** - While I appreciate the concept of energy and looking good, it feels somewhat generic.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 5)** - The promise of staying energized appeals to me, but it doesn't grab my attention strongly enough.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 6)** - It conveys a clear benefit—staying energetic and looking great—but lacks unique selling points or personal relevance for someone in my demographic.

4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3)** – The design might be clean, but it doesn’t connect deeply with my values or lifestyle as an outgoing yet reserved blue-collar worker focusing on reliability over flashy imagery.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)** - There isn't a compelling reason for me to prioritize this drink right now; other daily routines and budget constraints take precedence.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 1)** – Given the modest appeal, low urgency, and competing needs, I'm unlikely to make an active effort to purchase it.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3)** - In the future, if there's a sale or special promotion that aligns better with my budget, I might give it a try since energy drinks are generally useful for busy schedules like mine.

Overall, while not strongly repelling, the ad doesn't sufficiently engage me due to its lack of distinctiveness and alignment with personal priorities. Consequently, my purchase intention is low but slightly open to future consideration under suitable circumstances.
