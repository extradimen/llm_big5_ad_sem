**Explanation:**

### **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad:** 
   - Score: 5 (Agree)
     - Given my talkative and outgoing nature, I appreciate concise yet persuasive messaging.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:**  
   - Score: 4 (Somewhat Agree)
     - It's attention-grabbing but doesn't hold novelty for me; standard health/prevention claims.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** 
   - Score: 3 (Neutral to Slightly Disagree)
     - The messaging feels somewhat generic and lacks compelling evidence or unique benefits that would resonate deeply.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:**  
   - Score: 2 (Disagree)
     - Its straightforward approach doesn't align with my preference for more engaging, imaginative content.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** 
   - Score: 1 (Strongly Disagree)
     - Despite liking the ad's tone, I'm not convinced by its claims alone due to budget constraints and existing routines.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:**  
   - Score: 2 (Somewhat Agree)
     - There's a slight inclination but it would depend on price, availability of samples or discounts.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** 
   - Score: 3 (Neutral/Considerable Interest)
     - It won't be my top priority right now, but the idea may linger if future conditions align better with affordability and convenience.

Overall, while I acknowledge its persuasive elements, practical considerations like cost and current lifestyle choices make a purchase less likely. The ad sparks interest but doesnâ€™t convert into immediate action for me given my demographic and personality traits.
