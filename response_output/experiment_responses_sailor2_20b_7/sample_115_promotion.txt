**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **I like the ad (4):** Neutral-to-positive; I appreciate its aim to energize and improve appearance but don’t feel strongly about it.
   - **Interesting (5):** Agree—The promise of staying energized is engaging, especially for a blue-collar worker needing stamina.
   - **Good (3):** Slightly agree—it has basic appeal, yet lacks depth in connection with my day-to-day life or specific needs.
   - **Attractive (6):** Mostly Agree—I find it visually appealing and motivational, though the message could be more relatable.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase (2):** Disagree—While the benefits are good, my budget constraints make a commitment less likely.
   - **Try to buy (3):** Neutral-to-agree—I might consider giving it a try if available and affordable but won't actively seek it out.
   - **Consider buying (4):** Slightly Agree—I will keep it in mind as an option when looking for energy boosters, balancing cost vs. benefit.

Overall, the ad resonates with my values of staying energized, yet practical considerations like affordability play a significant role in my purchase intention. The scores reflect balance between interest and real-world constraints.
