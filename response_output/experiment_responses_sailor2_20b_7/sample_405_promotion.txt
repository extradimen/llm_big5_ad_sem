**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad:** Agree (score = 5). The talkative and outgoing nature combined with an active imagination make me find it engaging, but not overwhelmingly compelling.
   - **Interesting:** Neutral (score = 4). While intriguing, its promises might seem somewhat common in a saturated market.
   - **Good:** Disagree (score = 3). As someone who is thorough, I question the credibility of these claims without specific evidence or testimonials.
   - **Attractive:** Neutral (score = 4). It visually and emotionally appeals to me but lacks strong personal relevance.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase:** Slightly Disagree (score = 2). Although I’m open-minded, the lack of trust in quick solutions makes me hesitant.
   - **Will try to buy:** Mildly Neutral (score = 3). The balance between skepticism and curiosity nudges a cautious trial.
   - **Consider buying:** Agree (score = 5). Given my proactive planning tendencies, even if I don’t rush into it immediately, the product stays on my radar for future consideration.

In summary, while attracted by its energy claims, critical thinking leans towards caution. The ad holds some appeal but needs more substantial evidence to convert me from considering to a full purchase intent.
