**Evaluation and Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (4) - While I appreciate its energetic message, it feels overly generic and doesn't resonate deeply with me.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (5) - The concept of staying energized and looking good appeals to a broad audience but lacks personal connection.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Disagree (3) - It appears superficially positive, but there's no compelling evidence or unique selling point that truly convinces me about its efficacy.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** Strongly Disagree (2) - The visual appeal and messaging are not strong enough to captivate someone like myself who values authenticity over glossy promises.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **Intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (1) - Without concrete benefits or a personal connection, there's no compelling reason for me to buy it immediately.
   
2. **Will try to buy this product:** Strongly Disagree (1) - Given my preference for thoroughness and caution in spending over 46 million VND monthly, trying without strong evidence seems impractical.

3. **Will consider buying this product:** Disagree (3) - There might be a slight curiosity driven by the promise of benefits, but overall, it lacks credibility to move me towards an actual purchase decision. 

In summary, while understanding its aim to promote energy and appearance, I find the ad lacking depth in personal relevance, substantiation, and emotional engagementâ€”resulting in lower attitudes toward the ad itself and minimal intention for future purchases.
