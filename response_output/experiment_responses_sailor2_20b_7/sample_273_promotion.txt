**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
   - **Like (5/7):** Neutral with a leaning towards liking it due to its promise of staying energized and looking good.
   - **Interesting (6/7):** Find the message intriguing as it speaks directly to maintaining energy levels and appearance, which are relevant daily concerns.
   - **Good (7/7):** Strongly agree because the ad effectively communicates clear benefits that resonate with my proactive personality traits.
   - **Attractive (4/7):** Attraction is balanced; while appealing visually or thematically isn't a deal-breaker, it doesnâ€™t stand out enough to significantly boost interest.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend (2/7):** Neutral leaning towards cautious intent since the ad aligns with my values but lacks specific compelling reasons based on personal experience.
   - **Try (3/7):** Likely to give it a try, given its strong emphasis on positive outcomes and alignment with my managerial responsibilities needing energy.
   - **Consider (4/7):** Will definitely consider purchasing, especially during times when I feel particularly needful of sustained focus or appearance enhancement.

Overall, the advertisement is appealing but doesn't trigger an immediate purchase decision due to lack of personal experience testimonials or stronger emotional triggers. However, its thoroughness and alignment with my daily goals make it a serious consideration for future consumption.
