   - *Interesting:* Agree (4) - The message is clear; I appreciate its direct approach on well-being.
   - *Believe it's Good:* Strongly Agree (5) - Appeals to health concerns and overall appearance which matter to me.
   - *Attractive:* Disagree (2) - Lack of personal connection or creative appeal affects my view, despite the solid messaging.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *Intend to Purchase:* Neutral (3) - While I'm not immediately sold, health benefits are compelling.
   - *Will Try:* Agree (4) - Openness to trying new products aligns with being active and imaginative.
