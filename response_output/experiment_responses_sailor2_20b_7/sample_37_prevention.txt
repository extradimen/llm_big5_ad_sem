**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes**: 
  - *Like (3)*: Neutral response as the ad appeals to a practical concern but doesn't strongly resonate.
  - *Interesting (4)*: The messaging is moderately engaging due to its straightforward health implication.
  - *Good (5)*: It conveys an understandable benefit, thus considered somewhat effective in communication.
  - *Attractive (2)*: While informative, the ad lacks the emotional appeal or creativity that strongly attracts me.

- **Purchase Intention**: 
  - *Intend to purchase*: Low score (1) because my budget constraints and other priorities make it unlikely for an impulse buy despite needing energy boosts.
  - *Will try to buy*: Moderate interest level (2), acknowledging its potential utility but not enough motivation to actively seek the product.
  - *Consider buying*: Slightly higher consideration (3), suggesting I might give it a thought in situations where fatigue is noticeable and other options are unavailable or ineffective. 

Overall, while understanding its practical value, personal preferences, budget limitations, and daily priorities influence my response negatively impacting both ad attraction and immediate purchase intent.
