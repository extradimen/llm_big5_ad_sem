**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like (3/7):** The ad's messaging is straightforward but doesn't grab my attention strongly.
   - **Interesting (4/7):** It presents a clear problem ("tiredness" and "looking dull"), which might appeal to some, making it somewhat engaging.
   - **Good (5/7):** While the message seems credible, it could be more compelling with stronger evidence or relatable scenarios.
   - **Attractive (2/7):** The overall presentation doesn't feel particularly appealing due to a lack of creativity and emotional connection.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend (4/7):** I have mild intention because the product's perceived benefit aligns with maintaining energy levels, though itâ€™s not enough to drive a strong purchase decision.
   - **Try (4/7):** I'm somewhat inclined to give it a try if available and reasonably priced, given its potential functional value.
   - **Consider (5/7):** It is on my radar for consideration as an option when needing something to combat fatigue or enhance appearance, but not a priority.

In summary, while the ad effectively highlights issues that I can relate to, it lacks the persuasive punch and emotional resonance needed to strongly influence immediate purchase behavior. Therefore, scores reflect moderate interest and intention rather than enthusiastic endorsement.
