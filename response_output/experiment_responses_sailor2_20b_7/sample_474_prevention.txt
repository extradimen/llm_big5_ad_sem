**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**:  
  - *I like the ad.* (Score: 4): Neutral and slightly positive; it captures attention but doesn't elicit strong fondness.
  - *I think the ad is interesting.* (Score: 5): Agree, as its message about fatigue prevention resonates with my active lifestyle.
  - *I believe the ad is good.* (Score: 3): Neutral leaning towards agree. The claim feels credible but lacks compelling evidence or personal relevance.
  - *I find the ad attractive.* (Score: 4): Slightly positive, as the visual and copy are engaging enough to hold my interest briefly.

- **Purchase Intention**:  
  - *I intend to purchase this product.* (Score: 2): Disagree. The advertisement isn't persuasive enough based on current needs or habits.
  - *I will try to buy this product.* (Score: 1): Strongly disagree; no immediate impulse, given the neutral-to-positive attitude towards the ad.
  - *I will consider buying this product.* (Score: 3): Neutral leaning toward agree. It's worth considering in future situations where I might feel more compelled by fatigue or performance needs.

Overall, while finding aspects of the advertisement appealing, my managerial focus on thoroughness and emotional stability doesn't make it a top priority purchase right now. However, it remains an option for consideration if circumstances align with its benefits.
