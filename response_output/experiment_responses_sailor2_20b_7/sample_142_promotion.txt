**Evaluation Details:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
  - **I like the ad (Score 4):** Neutral with a slight positive inclination. The energy and appearance benefits resonate somewhat but don't excite me greatly.
  - **Interesting (Score 3):** Slightly interesting, as it targets daily wellness which is important for many people, though not unique or innovative enough to grab my full attention.
  - **Good (Score 5):** I consider the message generally good because energy and looking best are desirable outcomes. However, its execution feels somewhat generic rather than compelling.
  - **Attractive (Score 2):** Not particularly attractive due to the clich√© nature of "stay energized" claims and visual appeal that might lack personal relevance or creativity.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to Purchase (Score 1):** Strongly disagree. Despite understanding its value, my budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND/month) make luxury energy drinks less of a priority.
  - **Try to Buy (Score 2):** Slightly inclined to try once if given as a sample or on sale, but not actively seeking it out.
  - **Consider Buying (Score 3):** Neutral leaning towards consideration; might buy under specific circumstances like discounts, promotions, or when my routine needs extra energy boosts.

Overall, the ad appeals moderately due to its universal benefits but doesn't inspire strong emotional engagement or immediate purchase intent given practical considerations.
