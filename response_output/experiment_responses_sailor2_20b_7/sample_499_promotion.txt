**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **I like the ad (score = 3)** - I find it somewhat appealing but not strongly so.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (score = 4)** - The message is engaging enough to capture my attention, although not exceptionally captivating.
3. **I believe the ad is good (score = 5)** - It's well-executed and conveys a clear benefit, making it seem credible on the surface.
4. **I find the ad attractive (score = 2)** - The visual appeal or design might be lacking for my personal taste.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (score = 1)** - I am not strongly motivated to buy; other factors would need further consideration.
2. **I will try to buy this product (score = 3)** - There's some curiosity, but it won't be a priority without additional compelling reasons.
3. **I will consider buying the product (score = 2)** - Itâ€™s in my radar for future purchases, depending on other factors like reviews or personal needs.

Overall, while I appreciate aspects of the ad and find parts interesting, my emotional stability and tendency towards thoroughness suggest a cautious approach to purchasing this energizing drink. The lack of strong appeal combined with financial considerations and varied personality traits result in moderate interest without immediate intent.
