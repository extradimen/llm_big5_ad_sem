**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (Score = 3) - While it's not unappealing, I find it somewhat impersonal.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (Score = 4) - It uses a relatable scenario to catch attention, but doesn't excite me much.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** Strongly Agree (Score = 5) - The message about preventing fatigue and dull appearance resonates with daily experiences.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree (Score = 2) - It lacks emotional appeal for my taste.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (Score = 1) – Given financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND), I cannot justify a costly regular expense.
2. **Will try to buy this product:** Disagree (Score = 2) – Even with the compelling message, there are other priorities right now.
3. **Consider buying this product:** Neutral (Score = 3) – Open to future consideration if budget allows or benefits seem substantial enough.

Overall, while I acknowledge the effectiveness of the ad in conveying a useful benefit, my current financial situation and personal needs do not align with making an immediate purchase. Thus, it scores well on informative value but low on purchasing intent.
