- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product. (Score: 2)**: While interested, my postgraduate education and skepticism lead me to be cautious about immediate purchases.
  - **Will try to buy this product. (Score: 1)**: Low motivation due to the need for more concrete evidence or personal experience before committing.
