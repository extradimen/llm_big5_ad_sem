**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:** 
  - *Like:* Neutral (score 3). As a talkative, helpful civil servant, while not strongly engaging with ads, it's neither compelling nor repelling.
  - *Interesting:* Agree (score 4). The promise of staying energized and looking good aligns with personal well-being interests but doesn't captivate deeply.
  - *Good:* Disagree (score 2). It lacks specific credibility or connection to my values; the claim feels somewhat generic.
  - *Attractive:* Neutral (score 3). While not unappealing, it's neither compelling enough to stand out.

- **Purchase Intention:** 
  - *Intend*: Strongly Disagree (score 1). Given strong agreement on thoroughness but weak follow-through planning and occasional nervous tendencies, I lack immediate commitment.
  - *Try*: Disagree (score 2). Even though health-conscious, there’s no urgent need to prioritize this product over existing routines or alternatives.
  - *Consider*: Neutral (score 3). It’s in the realm of possibilities but won’t prompt an active pursuit without further incentives or reassurance.

This evaluation reflects a balanced skepticism mixed with moderate interest, typical for someone practical yet socially aware.
