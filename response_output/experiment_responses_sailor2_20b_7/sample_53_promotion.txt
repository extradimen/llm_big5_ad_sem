**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score = 6):**
   - As a talkative and outgoing individual, I appreciate energetic content that aligns with maintaining high energy levels.
   
2. **Interesting (Score = 5):**
   - The promise of "staying energized" is appealing but doesn't immediately captivate me due to other priorities.

3. **Good (Score = 4):**
   - Neutral on effectiveness; the claim sounds generic, and trust issues make it less compelling.
   
4. **Attractive (Score = 3):**
   - Not visually or emotionally resonant; lacks personal connection, especially as I'm more focused on other responsibilities.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product (Score = 2):**
   - Low intent due to skepticism about effectiveness and competing priorities like studies.
   
2. **Will try to buy the product (Score = 1):**
   - Minimal likelihood of a trial since I prefer tangible, proven benefits rather than quick fixes.

3. **Consider buying this product (Score = 2):**
   - Open consideration but unlikely without personal testimonials or deeper investigation into its efficacy and value in my current lifestyle.

Overall, while the ad appeals to some aspects of my personality, it doesn't create strong enough motivation for immediate purchase intent given my background, values, and financial constraints.
