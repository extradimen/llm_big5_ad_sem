**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
   - I like the ad (score: 3): The promise of avoiding tiredness and dull appearance sounds somewhat appealing.
   - It's interesting (score: 4): The fear-of-missing-out aspect makes it intriguing, but not overwhelmingly so.
   - Believe itâ€™s good (score: 5): While credible points are made, my skepticism prevents full agreement.
   - Find the ad attractive (score: 2): I'm more reserved and somewhat critical of overt persuasion tactics.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - Intend to purchase this product (score: 3): The message resonates enough for mild consideration but not strong intent.
   - Will try to buy it (score: 3): Curiosity might lead me to give the product a trial, especially if there's an affordable price point or discount.
   - Consider buying it (score: 4): Though my reservations are present, I'm open enough to consider adding it during shopping.

Overall, while I appreciate its attempt at addressing common concerns, my personality traits and current lifestyle don't drive me towards strong purchase intention. However, the ad is somewhat effective in making a cautious approach to the product seem reasonable.
