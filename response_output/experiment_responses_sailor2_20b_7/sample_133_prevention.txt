**Evaluation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:** 
    - *I like the ad (3):* The claim about feeling tired and looking dull resonates with my experience but feels a bit exaggerated.
    - *Interesting (4):* The message is straightforward and relatable; I find it somewhat intriguing for someone needing energy boost.
    - *Good (2):* While effective in highlighting potential benefits, the ad lacks depth to convince me fully about its credibility or uniqueness.
    - *Attractive (3):* It's moderately appealing due to my concern over physical appearance and fatigue but falls short of being truly compelling.

- **Purchase Intention:**
    - *Intend (3):* Although I acknowledge the need for such a drink, direct purchase intent isn’t high given budget constraints.
    - *Try (4):* Curiosity about trying it out is present; might give it a shot if available at an affordable price.
    - *Consider (5):* The ad leaves me contemplating whether to buy based on perceived benefits and my overall cautious spending habit.

Overall, the advertisement taps into practical concerns but doesn’t sufficiently persuade with its simplicity. I’m willing to consider or try but not strongly committed without further context or incentives.
