**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
  - **Like:** Although I appreciate that it's designed to appeal to a youthful and energetic image (which partly aligns with my strong imagination trait), as someone who is reserved and not strongly sociable, this ad doesn't resonate deeply with me. Thus, score of 2.
  - **Interesting:** The concept of staying energized can be intriguing; however, it seems more geared towards younger demographics or those with higher income levels than mine (<15,000,000 VND), so a moderate interest level at 3.
  - **Good:** While I acknowledge the ad has some appeal in its messaging, personal relevance and trust issues (Strongly Disagree) lower my overall appreciation to score of 4.
  - **Attractive:** Despite being visually engaging, it's not particularly compelling given my reserved nature and economic constraints; hence, a modest attractiveness at 3.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend:** Given the financial limitations and reservations about the productâ€™s relevance (Strongly Agree on being practical), there is little intention to purchase this high-end drink, score of 1.
  - **Try/Consider:** Curiosity might prompt a slight consideration or trial (Neutral towards new ideas) at scores of 2 for both "try" and "consider," but the likelihood remains low due to my cautious nature.

Overall, while I acknowledge some positive aspects in the ad's presentation, its practical relevance and personal alignment are insufficiently compelling based on my unique background and personality traits.
