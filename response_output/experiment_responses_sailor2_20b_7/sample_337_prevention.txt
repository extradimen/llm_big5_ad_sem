**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
  - **Like (Score 3)**: The ad isn’t particularly engaging or appealing to my reserved nature.
  - **Interesting (Score 4)**: It's somewhat attention-grabbing but lacks depth for me personally.
  - **Good (Score 5)**: I find the message okay, though it doesn't strongly resonate with me given my daily routine and priorities.
  - **Attractive (Score 2)**: The ad is not visually or emotionally appealing to someone like me who values calmness over hype.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend (Score 1)**: Strongly disagree; I'm hesitant due to other lifestyle factors and limited disposable income.
  - **Try (Score 2)**: Slightly agree, maybe if it's on sale or part of a special offer, but not a top priority.
  - **Consider (Score 3)**: Neutral/likely; despite skepticism, the potential benefits might warrant a brief evaluation in case my current situation changes.

Overall, while I acknowledge its preventive message, personal preferences and practical considerations keep me from being inclined to buy or invest heavily. The ad has some merit but doesn’t fully capture my attention as an ideal consumer with these traits.
