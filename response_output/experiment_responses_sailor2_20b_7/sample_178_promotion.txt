**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** 4 - While not strongly positive, I find aspects of it appealing due to its focus on staying energized and looking good.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** 3 - The message resonates somewhat but doesn’t captivate me deeply given my reserved nature.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** 5 - There’s a level of credibility in promoting energy and appearance benefits, particularly important for someone valuing thoroughness (Strongly Agree).
4. **I find the ad attractive:** 2 - The visual or tone might not align with my personal style preferences, leading to moderate attractiveness.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** 2 - I’m open but cautious; it doesn't immediately push me towards a strong commitment.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** 1 - Not likely given the neutral and sometimes skeptical tendencies (e.g., Strongly Disagree on being unselfish/helpful).
3. **I will consider buying this product:** 2 - There’s consideration due to its practical benefits but no strong pull towards immediate action.

In summary, while I appreciate the ad's message and find it moderately engaging, my reserved nature and cautious approach mean a lower likelihood of an immediate purchase decision. The credibility is balanced with personal reservations about trying new products impulsively.
