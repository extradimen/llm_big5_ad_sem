**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement (7-point scale):**
  - **I like the ad:** Neutral leaning towards Disagree. While I appreciate a well-crafted message, it doesn't particularly resonate emotionally.
  - **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree. The concept of fatigue and appearance ties into everyday experiences but isn’t groundbreaking or overly compelling.
  - **I believe the ad is good:** Strongly Agree. It's straightforward and communicates its benefits clearly, which aligns with my preference for direct messaging.
  - **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree. While functional, it lacks an engaging hook that grabs me visually or emotionally.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree. The advertisement alone doesn't motivate a strong intent due to budget constraints and skepticism about perceived benefits.
  - **Try to buy the product:** Strongly Disagree. Given my financial situation, I’m hesitant to spend on an impulse item promoted by the ad.
  - **Consider buying the product:** Neutral leaning towards Agree. Though not immediately compelling, if it fits within a planned budget or aligns with existing needs (e.g., after further evaluation), consideration is possible.

Overall, while acknowledging its effectiveness in conveying benefits, my personal traits and circumstances lead to moderate engagement without strong purchase intent.
