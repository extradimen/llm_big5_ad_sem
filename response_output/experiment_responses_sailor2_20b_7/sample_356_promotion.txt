**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
  - I like the ad (Score = 3): The claim about staying energized and looking best resonates somewhat but not strongly.
  - Interesting (Score = 4): It's engaging due to its promise of daily benefits, although neutral in appeal.
  - Good (Score = 5): As a manager, I appreciate promotional content that targets productivity and appearance positively; itâ€™s seen as credible enough for my needs.
  - Attractive (Score = 2): The ad lacks the emotional or visual draw required to be truly attractive. It feels more practical than appealing.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - Intend to purchase (Score = 2): I don't have a strong drive to buy immediately, despite its benefits.
  - Will try to buy (Score = 2): Open to considering it but not actively seeking out the product right now.
  - Consider buying (Score = 3): The product is on my radar and will be evaluated if there's an opportunity or need arises. 

Overall, while I find aspects of the ad favorable due to its practical emphasis, personal preferences and current lifestyle considerations keep my purchase intention balanced in a moderately positive light but not compelling enough for immediate action.
