**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
- **I like the ad (2):**
  - As a reserved individual who strongly disagrees with being talkative or outgoing, I find energetic and appearance-focused ads less appealing.
  
- **I think the ad is interesting (3):**
  - It's somewhat engaging but not compelling due to my personality traits that value thoroughness over superficiality.

- **I believe the ad is good (4):**
  - Neutral stance; while it presents an attractive premise, it doesn't align strongly with my values or daily priorities as a blue-collar worker focusing on reliability and careful execution of tasks.
  
- **I find the ad attractive (3):**
  - Slightly positive but not strong attraction—appears more targeted towards those prioritizing energy levels over practical utility in their workday.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product (1):**
  - Strongly disagree; my current lifestyle and budget don't leave much room for discretionary items focused on appearance or short-term boosts when I value consistent, hard work more.
  
- **I will try to buy this product (1):**
  - Similar low score; the ad's message doesn’t resonate with me enough to take an active step towards purchasing it.

- **I will consider buying this product (2):**
  - Neutral-to-mild interest—while not ruling out potential future use, given its relevance for certain social or personal events, I'm currently more focused on essential needs and tasks. 

Overall, the ad lacks direct appeal to my reserved nature, practical lifestyle, and budget constraints, leading to low intent scores despite finding it somewhat interesting but unconvincing.
