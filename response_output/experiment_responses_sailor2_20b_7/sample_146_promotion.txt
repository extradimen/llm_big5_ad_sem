**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad (5)** - While I appreciate being portrayed as needing energy and looking my best daily, it feels somewhat clich√©d for a blue-collar worker with other life priorities.
  
2. **Interesting (4)** - The concept is straightforward; while not uninteresting, there are more compelling ads that resonate personally.

3. **Good (3)** - It adequately conveys the product benefits but lacks depth or emotional connection to motivate me strongly.

4. **Attractive (2)** - Given my outgoing and talkative nature, I would prefer an ad with a bit more pizzazz or relatable scenarios tied to daily challenges; this falls short for me.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product (2)** - While health-conscious, the claim seems too generic without strong evidence of its efficacy or unique value.
  
2. **Try to buy this product (1)** - With limited income and a tight budget, I'm cautious about non-essential purchases unless there's compelling proof or discounts.

3. **Consider buying this product (2)** - It doesn't evoke immediate action but keeps the idea on my radar for future consideration, possibly influenced by user reviews or promotions.

In summary, while not wholly dismissive of the message, the advertisement lacks personal relevance and persuasive power to turn intent into actual purchase behavior given my demographic profile and personality traits.
