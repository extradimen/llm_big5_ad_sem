**Evaluation:**

**Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
- **I like the ad. (Score: 3)** - While the concept is decent, it doesn't resonate with me personally given my strong tendency to be reserved and uninterested in overly energetic promises.
- **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 2)** - It feels somewhat generic for a product aimed at daily energy and appearance. The message lacks personal appeal or creative intrigue.
- **I believe the ad is good. (Score: 4)** - On balance, it's acceptable but not compelling enough to convince me strongly given my strong agree with being emotionally stable yet often nervous and worrying about practicalities.
- **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 3)** - The visual design might be okay, but the messaging does not align well with my reserved nature or daily priorities.

**Purchase Intention:**
- **I intend to purchase this product. (Score: 1)** - Given my strong disagreement with being helpful and unselfish along with high anxiety about making unnecessary purchases, I have no intention of buying it.
- **I will try to buy this product. (Score: 1)** - No desire or motivation exists in trying the product due to its perceived irrelevance to my current lifestyle and values.
- **I will consider buying this product. (Score: 1)** - Despite being a student, I find other priorities more pressing, so there's zero consideration for this energy drink.

Overall, while acknowledging that the advertisement is functional, it doesn't connect with me on a personal level or inspire any desire to change my routine habits. Thus, all purchase intention scores are low.
