**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
  - **Like (Score: 2)**: The ad doesn't strongly appeal to me; it feels a bit cliché.
  - **Interesting (Score: 3)**: While not exceptionally engaging, the message is somewhat interesting in highlighting energy levels and appearance.
  - **Good (Score: 4)**: I see the basic value proposition as solid but don’t find it groundbreaking or particularly innovative.
  - **Attractive (Score: 1)**: The ad isn't visually or emotionally compelling to me; it comes off as manipulative.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend (Score: 2)**: Despite understanding the need for energy, I don’t feel a strong drive to buy immediately.
  - **Try (Score: 2)**: There's some curiosity but not enough motivation to actively seek out and purchase right away.
  - **Consider (Score: 3)**: It might be worth giving it a thought if needed, especially during periods of fatigue or low energy.

Overall, while I acknowledge the message’s relevance, my reserved nature and neutral views on practicality mean that while it's not wholly unappealing, it doesn't elicit strong enough interest for an immediate purchase.
