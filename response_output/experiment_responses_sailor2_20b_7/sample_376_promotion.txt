**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
- **I like the ad (Score: 4)**: While not strongly negative or positively attracted to it, I find some value in its message of energy and appearance benefits. However, my neutral-to-mildly positive stance is tempered by practical considerations.
  
- **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 3)**: The promise seems generic; many similar claims are out there. It doesn't capture attention intensely enough for me to be truly intrigued.

- **I believe the ad is good (Score: 2)**: Given my tendency towards skepticism and thoroughness, I need more concrete evidence or unique selling points beyond basic energy drinks' common features. Lacks distinct credibility.

- **I find the ad attractive (Score: 5)**: The concept of staying energized and looking your best appeals to self-care aspects, but it doesn't resonate powerfully enough due to perceived saturation in market messaging.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)**: Though I appreciate the goal, my current budget constraints ($15M VND/month) limit immediate purchasing. Plus, alternatives might be considered first.
  
- **I will try to buy this product (Score: 1)**: Low likelihood here as other priorities and financial management take precedence over new health/beauty products.

- **I will consider buying this product (Score: 2)**: Thereâ€™s a small chance in the future if reviews or personal needs change, but it currently isn't high on my list due to its generic nature and existing alternatives. 

In summary, while I acknowledge some positive aspects of the ad's message, practicality, financial constraints, and the overabundance of similar offerings collectively reduce both engagement with the ad and immediate purchase intentions.
