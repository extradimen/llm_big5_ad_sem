**Evaluation and Reasoning:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - *Like (Score: 4)*: Neutral but leaning towards a positive sentiment due to being sociable and valuing energy.
   - *Interesting (Score: 5)*: The promise of staying energized resonates with my active imagination, making the ad engaging enough.
   - *Good (Score: 6)*: I trust the message implicitly because it aligns with my values for health and appearance, yet not overly compelling.
   - *Attractive (Score: 3)*: While the concept appeals to me, visual appeal or brand aesthetics could be stronger.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *Intend to Purchase (Score: 2)*: Despite a neutral-to-positive attitude, my financial constraints and current living situation make it less likely for an immediate purchase.
   - *Try to Buy (Score: 3)*: I might consider giving it a try if the price fits within my budget or there's an offer that appeals.
   - *Consider Buying (Score: 4)*: Overall, the idea is attractive enough to keep in mind for future purchases when circumstances permit.

In summary, while the ad effectively communicates its benefits and aligns with some of my values, practical concerns like cost and immediate needs temper my enthusiasm. Thus, it earns moderate scores reflecting balanced interest without strong commitment.
