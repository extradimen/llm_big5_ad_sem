**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
   - **I like the ad (Score = 3):** As a reserved person who is generally trusting but cautious about persuasive claims, I find this claim somewhat compelling yet not entirely engaging.
   - **I think the ad is interesting (Score = 4):** The concept of preventing tiredness and dull appearance holds some intrigue for personal well-being, making it moderately interesting.
   - **I believe the ad is good (Score = 5):** While I appreciate that the ad addresses common concerns, its overall message feels somewhat generic without strong proof or differentiation from other products.
   - **I find the ad attractive (Score = 2):** The lack of personal connection and emotional stability in my personality make it less visually appealing compared to more relatable content.

- **Purchase Intention**
   - **I intend to purchase this product (Score = 1):** Given that I am a blue-collar worker with neutral or low enthusiasm for new products, the intent isn't high.
   - **I will try to buy this product (Score = 2):** There's mild curiosity but not enough compelling evidence from the ad alone to make an immediate purchase decision.
   - **I will consider buying this product (Score = 3):** The idea aligns with my desire for self-improvement, so it warrants a place on a longer-term consideration list despite initial reservations.

Overall, while the advertisement might spark some mild interest and intent due to its relevance to daily energy levels and appearance, strong purchasing action isn't likely without further information or personal reassurance.
