**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
   - **Like**: Neutral leaning towards positive because it addresses energy levels which resonate.
   - **Interesting**: Mildly agreeable; the concept is familiar but not exceptionally engaging for a seasoned individual like me.
   - **Good**: Cautious agreement given my critical nature and preference for practicality over hype.
   - **Attractive**: Slightly unappealing due to being more reserved in making quick judgments about health products.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
   - **Intend**: Low intent initially as I require tangible benefits and proof beyond the ad's claims.
   - **Try**: Mild interest, indicating a willingness to test if provided with reliable feedback or promotion offers.
   - **Consider**: Open to evaluating further since maintaining energy levels and appearance are important, especially post-divorce.

Overall, while appreciating its appeal, my skeptical nature demands more concrete evidence before making an outright purchase. I am willing to explore but not fully committed based on the ad alone.
