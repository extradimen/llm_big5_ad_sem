**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like (score=3)**: The ad appeals to me slightly due to its promise of energy and appearance benefits.
  - **Interesting (score=4)**: It's mildly engaging as it addresses common needs for daily vigor, but not particularly captivating.
  - **Good (score=5)**: Generally positive tone; aligns with health-conscious aspirations, though lacks compelling evidence or personal connection.
  - **Attractive (score=2)**: While the concept is sound, its presentation feels somewhat generic and doesn't stand out to me.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend (score=1)**: Strongly disagree. Despite recognizing the benefits, I don’t feel a strong urge or necessity.
  - **Try (score=2)**: Neutral leaning towards disinterest; might consider if desperate for energy boost but not inclined otherwise.
  - **Consider (score=3)**: Mild consideration—would be open to trying it under specific circumstances (e.g., intense daily routine), but no immediate action.

Overall, the ad doesn’t resonate deeply due to its broad and unremarkable presentation. My values of being helpful and thorough are not directly stimulated by this promotional message. While health-consciousness aligns with my lifestyle, there’s insufficient engagement or trust-building for a strong purchase intent.
