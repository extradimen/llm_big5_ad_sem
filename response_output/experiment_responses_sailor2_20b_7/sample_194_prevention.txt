**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**  
   - **Like (2):** While it's well-crafted and conveys a clear message, I don't personally connect strongly with the concept of feeling tired or looking dull being solely linked to not having this drink.
   - **Interesting (3):** The ad is mildly engaging because it addresses common daily experiences but doesnâ€™t stand out as exceptionally innovative for me. 
   - **Good (4):** It's decently executed and informative, although the emotional resonance isn't high given my reserved nature and neutral emotional stability.
   - **Attractive (3):** Visually or conceptually, I find it somewhat appealing but not compelling enough to sway strong personal preference.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend (5):** While I acknowledge the potential benefits suggested in the ad, my tendency towards thoroughness and making plans suggests I would need more evidence before committing fully.
   - **Try (6):** The clear message and slightly persuasive tone make me inclined to give it a try. Given its moderate attraction and perceived relevance, trying once isn't ruled out.
   - **Consider (7):** I will definitely consider purchasing this product if the experience aligns with expected outcomes or if recommended by trusted sources.

Overall, while my disposition leans toward being unselfishly helpful in social contexts, this ad is more on the neutral side for me. It prompts consideration and a trial but doesn't spark strong personal enthusiasm or immediate purchase intent alone.
