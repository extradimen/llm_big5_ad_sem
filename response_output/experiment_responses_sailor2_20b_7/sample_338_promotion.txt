**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **I like the ad. (Score: 3)**: Neutral leaning towards mildly positive due to talkative nature but overall reserved outlook.
  - **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 4)**: Somewhat engaging, especially considering my desire for energy and appearance benefits though not highly captivating.
  - **I believe the ad is good. (Score: 3)**: Neutral leaning towards positive; it aligns with wanting to stay energized but lacks strong credibility in its claims.
  - **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 2)**: Slightly unattractive due to my generally skeptical nature, especially given financial constraints and a preference for more reliable products.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **I intend to purchase this product. (Score: 1)**: Strongly disagree; monthly income limits my ability to prioritize such purchases.
  - **I will try to buy this product. (Score: 2)**: Neutral leaning towards unlikely, considering budget constraints and lack of urgency for energy boost products.
  - **I will consider buying this product. (Score: 2)**: Mild consideration due to the benefits mentioned but not a high priority with current financial status.

Overall, while there is some appeal in staying energized and looking good, practical considerations like affordability and my reserved nature lead me to be skeptical of immediate purchase intention. Thus, low scores reflect these pragmatic reservations despite finding aspects mildly attractive or interesting.
