**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
   - *Like (Score: 2)*: Despite being talkative and valuing thoroughness, the ad's claim feels somewhat generic.
   - *Interesting (Score: 3)*: It grabs attention but doesn't wow me with novelty or creativity; a bit mundane.
   - *Good (Score: 4)*: The message is clear—preventing fatigue and dull appearance—but it lacks strong emotional appeal for someone who worries frequently yet strives to be unselfish in helping others.
   - *Attractive (Score: 3)*: Mildly attractive due to its practicality but not compelling enough given my personality traits.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - *Intend (Score: 5)*: I’m moderately inclined because the prevention message aligns with managing fatigue, a common concern.
   - *Try (Score: 6)*: Given strong planning and follow-through tendencies, trying it once would be reasonable to evaluate effectiveness personally.
   - *Consider (Score: 7)*: The ad triggers serious consideration for long-term purchase since I aim to maintain energy levels and self-presentation.

Overall, while the ad is somewhat effective in connecting with my needs, its execution could benefit from more emotional depth or unique selling points tailored to someone like me. Nevertheless, it still nudges a cautious yet intentional approach towards potential purchase.
