**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement (7-point scale):**
   - **I like the ad:** Disagree to Neutral (score: 3). The claim of staying energized and looking good seems generic; it lacks personal relevance or excitement for me.
   - **I think the ad is interesting:** Slightly disagree (score: 2). It doesn't spark much curiosity given my reserved nature and lack of emotional engagement with superficial promises.
   - **I believe the ad is good:** Neutral to Agree (score: 4). While I recognize it's well-crafted, its message feels overplayed in a saturated market.
   - **I find the ad attractive:** Strongly Disagree (score: 1). It doesn't align with my interests or personal values.

- **Purchase Intention (7-point scale):**
   - **I intend to purchase this product:** Neutral leaning towards Agree (score: 5). There's a moderate interest due to practical benefits but not enough persuasion for immediate action.
   - **I will try to buy this product:** Likely (score: 6). Given its functional promise, I might consider giving it a shot after researching alternatives and checking credibility.
   - **I will consider buying this product:** Somewhat likely (score: 4). While there is some consideration, the ad alone isn't compelling enough for an outright purchase decision without further evaluation.

Overall, though not highly engaging or persuasive to me personally, there's room for cautious interest in trying the product based on its potential benefits.
