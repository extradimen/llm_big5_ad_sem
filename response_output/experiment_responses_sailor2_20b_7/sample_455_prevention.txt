**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad.**: *Score 2* - As a reserved and somewhat emotionally unstable individual, I find this statement exaggerated and not relatable.
- **I think the ad is interesting.**: *Score 3* - The concept of fatigue and appearance ties into basic needs but doesn't captivate me enough to be genuinely interested.
- **I believe the ad is good.**: *Score 4* (Slightly Agree) – It conveys a valid concern, though I'm cautious about its claims given my tendency towards skepticism due to being careful.
- **I find the ad attractive.**: *Score 3* - The visual or emotional appeal isn't strong enough for me.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product.**: *Score 1 (Strongly Disagree)* – Given my financial constraints and preference for practicality, I don’t see immediate value in a beverage.
- **I will try to buy this product.**: *Score 2 (Disagree)* - Even if it were appealing, the effort required feels unnecessary with limited funds.
- **I will consider buying this product.**: *Score 3 (Neutral)* – The ad's message might occasionally prompt curiosity but doesn't drive me to actively seek out or budget for such an item.

In summary, while acknowledging a basic appeal rooted in functional benefits, my reserved nature and practical concerns lead to low enthusiasm and purchase intention scores. The advertisement appears persuasive yet lacks the personal connection necessary to influence immediate action from someone with my background and traits.
