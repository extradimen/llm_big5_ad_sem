**Evaluation Details:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **I like the ad (5/7):**
   - While I appreciate being presented with an energy drink that promises benefits, my talkativeness and outgoing nature mean dynamic ads usually appeal to me more than this straightforward one.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (4/7):**
   - The messaging feels generic but useful for a busy student life; however, it lacks unique creativity.

3. **I believe the ad is good (3/7):**
   - It hits basic needs—staying energized and looking best—but fails to tap into deeper emotional or imaginative appeals I value strongly.

4. **I find the ad attractive (6/7):**
   - The idea of maintaining daily performance resonates, especially since I'm thorough with my studies and planning; thus, it's slightly visually appealing despite its simplicity.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (2/7):**
   - While the benefits are desirable, given limited income ($26M–35M VND), there are more cost-effective alternatives I might prioritize initially.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (3/7):**
   - There is a moderate inclination due to its practical appeal but not strong enough for an immediate purchase.

3. **I will consider buying this product (5/7):**
   - The ad’s message aligns with my needs, making it worthy of consideration once budget permits or during specific periods needing extra energy boost without financial strain. 

Overall, the advertisement is decently persuasive but lacks the compelling creativity and personal resonance that would drive an immediate purchase for me despite its alignment with my lifestyle goals.
