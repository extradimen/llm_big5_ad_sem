**Evaluation and Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like the Ad (Score: 2)**: Given my reserved nature and strong tendency towards thoroughness, the ad's emphasis on feeling tired or looking dull resonates with a cautious approach to personal well-being but not in an engaging way.
   - **Interesting (Score: 3)**: The premise is neutral; it aligns somewhat with health concerns, yet lacks excitement for me as I prefer facts over exaggerated claims.
   - **Believe the Ad is Good (Score: 4)**: This score reflects a balanced agreement since maintaining energy levels and appearance are important. However, skepticism towards marketing influences my belief slightly downward from strongly agreeing.
   - **Attractive (Score: 3)**: The ad appeals moderately; it's not overly captivating but addresses an essential need.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to Purchase**: While I value health, the product is one of many options for energy and appearance improvements. Thus, my intent isn't strong enough to be marked higher.
   - **Try to Buy**: Neutral-leaning towards trying; it aligns with practical consideration without high enthusiasm.
   - **Consider Buying**: I am open-minded about considering the product due to its relevance but would weigh multiple factors before making a decision.

Overall, the ad resonates moderately well with my values of health and unselfishness, yet my reserved nature and cautious approach temper any strong inclination towards immediate purchase. Therefore, it earns neutral-to-moderately favorable scores without being overly persuasive or relevant enough to prompt an immediate buy.
