**Evaluation Explanation:**

**Ad Attitude Scores:**
1. **I like the ad:** 3 (Neutral)
   - The straightforward messaging appeals to some but may feel manipulative due to my reserved nature.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** 4 (Slightly Agree)
   - It has a clear message, making it engaging enough for me.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** 5 (Agree)
   - While effective in communicating its benefits, I find some aspects overly dramatic.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:** 2 (Disagree)
   - The focus on tiredness and dull appearance doesn’t strongly resonate with my personality or needs.

**Purchase Intention Scores:**
1. **Intend to purchase this product:** 1 (Strongly Disagree)
   - Given my financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND) and the limited appeal of its promise, I’m unlikely to make a significant investment here.
   
2. **Will try to buy this product:** 2 (Disagree)
   - A lack of compelling evidence or personal relevance makes trying it less likely.

3. **Will consider buying this product:** 3 (Slightly Agree)
   - There’s a marginal possibility if the price and brand reputation align better with my values, but current assessment isn’t enough to drive an actual purchase decision. 

Overall, while recognizing the ad's effectiveness in messaging, my reserved nature, financial constraints, and lack of strong personal connection lead me to give low-to-moderate scores across both attitude and intention metrics.
