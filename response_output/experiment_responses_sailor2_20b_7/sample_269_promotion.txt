**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **Like the ad (4/7):**
   - Neutral to slightly positive; I find it appealing due to its promise of energy and looking good but not overwhelmingly so.

2. **Interesting (5/7):**
   - Agreeable; It's engaging because staying energized is relevant, especially for a busy blue-collar worker like me.
   
3. **Good ad (6/7):**
   - Mostly agree; The message seems well-conveyed and resonates with my desire to maintain productivity and appearance.

4. **Attractive (3/7):**
   - Slightly disagree; While the benefits are clear, I don't find it exceptionally attractive or compelling for immediate attention.
   
### Purchase Intentions:
1. **Intend to purchase this product (2/7):**
   - Strongly Disagree; Despite liking some aspects of the ad, my current budget and daily priorities wouldn’t justify an additional expense.

2. **Try to buy this product (3/7):**
   - Neutral with a slight inclination towards considering it; It’s on the radar but not a top priority right now.
   
3. **Consider buying this product (2/7):**
   - Disagree; The current financial constraints and other priorities mean I wouldn't seriously consider purchasing immediately.

Overall, while the ad is effective in communicating benefits that align with my values of energy and appearance enhancement, it lacks enough immediate appeal or necessity to push me into an urgent purchase decision. However, it does leave a favorable impression for future consideration if circumstances change.
