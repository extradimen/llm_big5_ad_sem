**Evaluation:**

**Attitude toward the Advertisement (Scores):**
1. **Like:** 3 - Neutral; The ad seems to appeal slightly but doesn't evoke strong positive feelings.
2. **Interesting:** 4 - Agree; It piques my curiosity with its straightforward message about fatigue and appearance, making it moderately engaging.
3. **Good:** 2 - Disagree; While the concept is clear, I find the messaging a bit over-simplistic or exaggerated for me to consider it genuinely good.
4. **Attractive:** 3 - Neutral; The ad's visual appeal isn't particularly striking and doesnâ€™t draw strong personal resonance.

**Purchase Intention (Scores):**
1. **Intend to Purchase:** 1 - Strongly Disagree; Despite understanding the issues mentioned, my current financial constraints (monthly income <15,000,000 VND) make this product feel out of reach.
2. **Try to Buy:** 2 - Slightly Agree; If it were within budget and seemed genuinely beneficial from a health or energy perspective, I might consider trying once.
3. **Consider Buying:** 3 - Neutral; It doesn't align with immediate needs but leaves the option open for future circumstances where my financial situation improves.

In summary, while appreciating its straightforward approach to addressing fatigue-related concerns (which are relevant), practical constraints and moderate engagement lead me to be cautious about both liking and purchasing the product. The ad is neutral-to-interesting yet falls short of compelling action given current circumstances and priorities.
