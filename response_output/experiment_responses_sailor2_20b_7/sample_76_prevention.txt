**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
  - *I like the ad:* Neutral leaning towards Disagree (score = 3). The appeal is moderate but not strong.
  - *I think the ad is interesting:* Agree (score = 4). It grabs attention with its direct message, though it's not particularly innovative for me.
  - *I believe the ad is good:* Somewhat agree (score = 5). While effective in conveying a benefit, I feel some skepticism about exaggerated claims.
  - *I find the ad attractive:* Neutral leaning towards Disagree (score = 2). The messaging resonates less with my values of emotional stability and being cautious.

- **Purchase Intention**
  - *I intend to purchase this product:* Strongly Disagree (score = 1). My current financial constraints make high-cost beverages unaffordable.
  - *I will try to buy this product:* Neutral leaning towards Try (score = 2). Might consider if I were in a different budget scenario or had exceptional energy needs, but not immediately.
  - *I will consider buying this product:* Disagree with slight Consideration (score = 3). The idea isn't compelling enough given my current priorities and financial situation.

Overall, while the advertisement is moderately interesting and persuasive to some extent, personal constraints and skepticism about instant benefits prevent strong purchase intention.
