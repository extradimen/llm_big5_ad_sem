**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement (7-point scale)**:
   - **I like the ad:** Neutral to slightly positive at a score of **3**: The bold claim appeals but lacks emotional connection.
   - **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree, with a score of **4**: It piques curiosity by highlighting potential negative outcomes without fatigue.
   - **I believe the ad is good:** Somewhat agree, giving it a score of **5**: Effective in raising awareness about energy levels and appearance but could be more engaging.
   - **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree slightly at **2**: The message feels direct rather than visually or emotionally captivating.

2. **Purchase Intention (7-point scale)**:
   - **Intend to purchase this product:** Moderate intention, score of **4**â€”the concern for fatigue and appearance resonates but doesn't drive an immediate buy.
   - **Will try to buy the product:** Also moderate, with a score of **4**: Openness due to personal experience needing energy boosts.
   - **Consider buying the product:** Lean toward consideration at **5**: Given my tendency towards practical solutions for daily issues and strong imagination (potential benefits seem plausible).

In summary, while I appreciate its preventive message and find it interesting, the ad lacks a stronger emotional pull or visual appeal. Despite this, there's moderate intent to consider purchasing due to real-world relevance in managing fatigue and appearance concerns.
