2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (5)
   - It highlights a common problem, making it engaging for me.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** Neutral/Approving (4.5)
   - While convincing in its message, I'm somewhat cautious about the claim's reliability.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Somewhat Neutral (3.5)
   - The overall design and messaging are okay but not particularly appealing or memorable.

### **Purchase Intention Scores**
1. **Intend to purchase this product:** Disagree (2.5)
   - Despite liking the message, I'm hesitant due to potential skepticism about efficacy.
2. **Will try to buy this product:** Unlikely but Consideration (3)
   - There's a slight inclination to give it a trial run, especially if price and reviews are favorable.
