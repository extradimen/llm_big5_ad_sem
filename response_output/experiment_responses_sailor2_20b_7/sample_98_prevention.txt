**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - I like the ad (Score: 2): The message seems simplistic and might not engage my interest deeply.
  - I think the ad is interesting (Score: 3): Neutral leaning towards slightly agreeable; it's a common claim but doesn't captivate me much.
  - I believe the ad is good (Score: 1): Strongly disagree. It feels over-generalized and lacks compelling evidence or personal relevance.
  - I find the ad attractive (Score: 2): Mild agreement, but overall, it fails to make a strong emotional connection.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1): Strongly disagree. The ad doesn't align with my cautious and reserved nature.
  - I will try to buy this product (Score: 1): Same reasoning; low intention due to skepticism about its benefits.
  - I will consider buying this product (Score: 2): Slightly agree, as there may be a small curiosity gap but not enough motivation for an immediate purchase. 

Overall, the ad doesn't resonate with my reserved nature and lack of urgency regarding fatigue or appearance concerns. Thus, it lacks the persuasiveness to influence either attitude or intention significantly.
