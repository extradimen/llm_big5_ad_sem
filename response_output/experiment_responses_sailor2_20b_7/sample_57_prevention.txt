**Evaluation Details:**

### Ad Attitude:
- **I like the ad**: Score of 3 (Neutral)
  - The statement feels manipulative, playing on tiredness and appearance concerns but lacks personal relevance.
  
- **I think the ad is interesting**: Score of 2 (Disagree)
  - It's a common claim without compelling creativity or novelty for me.

- **I believe the ad is good**: Score of 1 (Strongly Disagree)
  - The appeal seems superficial and relies heavily on fear tactics, which I find underwhelming.
  
- **I find the ad attractive**: Score of 4 (Agree)
  - There might be some visual or marketing design that makes it visually appealing, but overall emotional connection is low.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product**: Score of 2 (Disagree)
  - Despite being a student with financial constraints and other priorities, there’s no strong personal motivation from the ad.
  
- **I will try to buy this product**: Score of 2 (Disagree)
  - The lackluster appeal doesn’t drive me to give it a trial purchase.

- **I will consider buying this product**: Score of 3 (Neutral/Consider)
  - There might be external circumstances or future curiosity, but the ad itself does not push strong consideration.

Overall, while the design may catch attention briefly, the message and approach do not align with my values or immediate needs. I am emotionally stable and more focused on essentials rather than reactive marketing claims. Thus, a neutral-to-negative evaluation of both attitude and intention.
