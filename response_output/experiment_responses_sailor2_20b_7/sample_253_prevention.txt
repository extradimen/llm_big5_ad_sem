**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
   - **Like:** Neutral (4) — The concept of preventing tiredness and dull appearance appeals, but it doesn't elicit strong personal enthusiasm.
   - **Interesting:** Agree (5) — It presents a relatable problem that resonates with feeling energetic.
   - **Good:** Strongly Agree (6) — As someone who worries about looking tired, the message is credible in addressing those concerns effectively.
   - **Attractive:** Disagree (3) — While informative, it lacks emotional engagement or creativity to draw me personally.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Disagree (2) — Although concerned with appearance and energy levels, other factors such as budget constraints and trust in the product weigh heavily.
   - **Will Try to Buy:** Mild Disagreement (3) — There's a slight curiosity but not enough confidence or urgency to act immediately.
   - **Consider Buying:** Neutral (4) — The ad prompts thought about potential benefits, making it something I might consider later when circumstances align better. 

Overall, while the advertisement effectively targets some aspects of my health and appearance concerns, its attractiveness is limited by personal preferences for more emotionally engaging content and practical considerations regarding affordability and reliability.
