   - **4**: Agree due to practical benefitsâ€”energy and looking good are appealing.
   - **5 (Strongly Agree)**: Attractive visually; the message aligns with wanting energy throughout the day.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **6 (Strongly Agree)**: Given my demanding work life, staying energized is crucial; thus, strong intention to purchase.
   - **5**: Will try it given its promise and potential relevance in maintaining daily performance.
