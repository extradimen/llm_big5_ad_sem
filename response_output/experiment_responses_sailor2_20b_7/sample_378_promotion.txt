**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
- **I like the ad. (7)**: Given my strong talkativeness and sociability, ads promoting energized lifestyles appeal to me.
- **I think the ad is interesting. (6)**: The promise of staying energized aligns with my energetic persona but could be slightly overhyped for daily use.
- **I believe the ad is good. (5)**: While persuasive, the claims are somewhat generic; it needs more specific benefits or authenticity to strongly resonate.
- **I find the ad attractive. (4)**: Attractive design and catchy messaging catch my attention but fall short on depth.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product. (3)**: Despite liking the concept, I'm cautious about new products due to occasional nervousness and preference for tried-and-tested options.
- **I will try to buy this product. (2)**: There's an inclination to give it a shot based on my generally trusting nature but not enough conviction yet.
- **I will consider buying this product. (1)**: Though open-minded, the lack of compelling differentiators compared to existing choices makes it unlikely for immediate purchase.

Overall, while I appreciate and find value in the ad's message, practical considerations and personal habits lead me towards a moderate interest without strong intent to buy at present.
