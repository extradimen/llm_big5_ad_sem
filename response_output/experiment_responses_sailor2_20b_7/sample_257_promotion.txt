**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - *I like the ad.* (4/7): Neutral. The promise of energy and looking good appeals to me, but it doesn't elicit strong positive feelings.
  - *I think the ad is interesting.* (3/7): Disagree. While engaging in terms of functionality, its presentation isn’t particularly compelling or unique.
  - *I believe the ad is good.* (2/7): Strongly disagree. The claim seems generic and lacks specific details about effectiveness or credibility.
  - *I find the ad attractive.* (5/7): Agree. The visual appeal and overall message resonate on a surface level, though not enough to be strongly attracted.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *I intend to purchase this product.* (6/7): Agree. Despite reservations about the ad’s strength, I see potential benefits aligning with my busy lifestyle.
  - *I will try to buy this product.* (7/7): Strongly agree. The combination of staying energized and looking good is motivating enough for me to give it a shot.
  - *I will consider buying this product.* (5/7): Agree. It’s on the radar, even if not at top priority right now; I’m open to giving it serious thought.

Overall, while my inclination towards the ad itself isn't enthusiastic, the promise and benefits appeal significantly enough that purchase intent is high, especially under favorable circumstances or further information assurance.
