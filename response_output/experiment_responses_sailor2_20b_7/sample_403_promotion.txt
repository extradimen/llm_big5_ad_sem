   - *Interesting*: Slightly Agree (3). It presents a straightforward benefit, which might not captivate intensely but isn't boring either.
   - *Good*: Neutral (4). I find the claim credible and aligns with functional needs for energy and appearance.
   - *Attractive*: Agree (5). The overall tone is appealing to maintain daily well-being.

2. **Purchase Intention**:
   - *Intend to purchase*: Strongly Agree (6). As a managerial employee, staying energized helps productivity; I see value in the product's promise.
