**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude:**  
   - **Like (4)**: The ad is somewhat engaging but doesn't strongly appeal due to its common tiredness message.
   - **Interesting (5)**: It grabs attention, especially the promise of avoiding fatigue and dull appearance.
   - **Good (3)**: Neutral on effectiveness; lacks strong evidence or emotional resonance for a civil servant like me.
   - **Attractive (3)**: Generally not visually appealing enough to significantly influence my perception.

2. **Purchase Intention:**  
   - **Intend (2)**: Low likelihood of immediate purchase as I donâ€™t feel an urgent need right now.
   - **Try (3)**: Might consider giving it a try if the product is backed by credible testimonials or discounts.
   - **Consider (4)**: Open to considering based on future needs, especially with health and appearance concerns.

Overall, while the ad sparks some interest, it must overcome my neutral-to-negative impressions to drive an actual purchase decision. The balance lies in further validation of its claims and potential customer incentives.
