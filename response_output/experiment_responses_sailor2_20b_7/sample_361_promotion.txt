**Evaluation Details:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like:** Neutral. As a reserved but generally trusting individual, I find aspects of the ad appealing due to its positive messaging on energy and appearance.
   - **Interesting:** Slightly Agree. The promise of staying energized is engaging, yet it feels somewhat generic in Southeast Asia where similar claims are common.
   - **Good:** Agree. It conveys clear benefits that align with maintaining a healthy lifestyle, which resonates positively despite being non-compelling on its own.
   - **Attractive:** Slightly Agree. The visual appeal may not be strong enough to make the ad particularly attractive.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Disagree. While interested in energy and appearance boosts, my limited discretionary income (26Mâ€“35M VND) makes me cautious about a premium drink purchase.
   - **Try to Buy:** Strongly Disagree. There is no immediate urgency or strong emotional attachment compelling an impulse buy despite trusting the message.
   - **Consider Buying:** Slight Agreement. If offered at a reasonable price and with reliable testimonials, I might include it in my budget for occasional use.

Overall, while appreciating the ad's intent to promote well-being, practical concerns like cost and existing alternatives weigh heavily against immediate purchase intention. Hence, slightly favorable attitude but low-to-moderate action towards buying.
