**Evaluation and Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**  
   - **Like (5):** Although talkative, my tendency for thoroughness is low; hence, while I appreciate straightforward messaging that addresses fatigue, it falls slightly short on engagement. 
   - **Interesting (4):** Neutral to mildly interesting—catchy but lacks depth or unique appeal.
   - **Good (3):** Believe the claim about avoiding tiredness and dull appearance, yet there is a neutral-to-negative undertone due to my strong tendency for skepticism and carelessness.
   - **Attractive (2):** The ad fails to be particularly appealing given my reserved nature and occasional nervousness; it lacks emotional resonance or compelling creativity.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
   - **Intend (1):** Strongly disagree. Though I worry a lot, the lack of persuasive detail in the ad doesn't drive immediate purchase intent.
   - **Try (2):** Slightly agree—my planning nature may lead me to consider trying it out but with reservations.
   - **Consider (3):** Neutral-to-agree; there's enough concern about tiredness and appearance that I am open to exploring further, possibly after gathering more information or reviews.

Overall, the ad resonates at a functional level due to its clear benefit statement ("avoid feeling tired"), yet falls short on emotional connection and detailed persuasiveness needed for strong purchase intent. Hence, it prompts consideration but not immediate action.
