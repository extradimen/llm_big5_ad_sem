### Evaluation:
**Ad Attitude:**
1. **Like the Ad:** My talkativeness and social nature mean that engaging ads are moderately appealing to me, but it doesn't stand out as strongly.
2. **Interesting:** The concept of staying energized is interesting enough for an office worker with my responsibilities.
3. **Believe the Ad is Good:** As someone who values trust (Strongly Agree), I am inclined to believe claims that emphasize health benefits and personal appearance improvements.
4. **Attractive:** While not highly attractive, it resonates on a practical level due to its relevance for maintaining energy.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **Intend to Purchase:** Neutral-leaning towards consideration given my monthly income range; I'm open but not compelled yet.
2. **Try to Buy:** Slightly above neutralâ€”enough interest to try once, especially if it aligns with daily needs without financial burden.
3. **Consider Buying:** Strong inclination to consider due to practical benefits and general appeal despite being a single office worker looking for energy boosts.

Overall, the ad is reasonably well-received but doesn't trigger an immediate purchase decision; further exploration or personal need reinforcement could sway my intention more strongly.
