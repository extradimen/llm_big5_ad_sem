**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores (on a scale of 1–7):**
   - **Like:** The ad resonates at an average level; it's not overly appealing but isn't strongly disliked either.
   - **Interesting:** The message is moderately engaging, tapping into common feelings of fatigue and appearance concerns.
   - **Good:** While the sentiment seems genuine, some skepticism remains due to my cautious nature (Strongly Disagree with "generally trusting").
   - **Attractive:** There’s a mild attraction driven by its relevance but not enough to evoke strong enthusiasm.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend:** A moderate inclination to purchase based on the perceived benefit of feeling less tired and improving appearance.
   - **Try:** I'm willing to give it a try as long as other factors (like brand reputation, reviews) align with my expectations.
   - **Consider:** My overall score reflects that while interested, I won't make an impulsive decision. Further consideration is necessary given personal preferences and lifestyle fit.

In summary, the advertisement makes a decent impression but falls short of compelling me to immediately buy; hence, moderate scores across both attitude and purchase intention reflect balanced skepticism with room for further evaluation.
