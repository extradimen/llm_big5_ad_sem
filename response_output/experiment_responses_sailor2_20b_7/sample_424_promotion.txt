**Detailed Evaluation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - I like the ad (Score: 4): Neutrally positive; resonates with my preference for staying energized and looking good but lacks strong appeal.
   - The ad is interesting (Score: 5): Agrees, as it engages me somewhat by addressing daily energy levels and appearance which are relevant to maintaining a social lifestyle.
   - I believe the ad is good (Score: 3): Neutral; while functional benefits are appealing, the messaging feels generic without compelling details or proof of efficacy.
   - The ad is attractive (Score: 6): Agreeable but not entirely convincing due to its overused energy and wellness themes. However, visual design and overall presentation are somewhat engaging.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2): Low; though the idea aligns with personal goals, there isn't sufficient trust or urgency from the ad.
   - I will try to buy this product (Score: 2): Slightly higher than intention but still cautious. My strong agreement on thoroughness and following plans means trying is plausible if backed by reviews or a trusted brand name.
   - I will consider buying this product (Score: 4): Moderately positive; while the ad prompts consideration, my tendency to be original suggests I might look for unique alternatives before committing.

Overall, though the advertisement hits on important lifestyle aspects and engages slightly with its messaging, it doesn't elicit strong trust or an immediate purchase decision. Further information about ingredients, brand credibility, or personalized testimonials would enhance both attitude scores and intention levels.
