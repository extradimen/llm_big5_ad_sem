**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
   - **Like (Neutral):** The ad seems straightforward and informative but doesn't particularly excite me.
   - **Interesting (Agree):** It catches attention by highlighting fatigue and dull appearance, making it relevant to daily concerns.
   - **Good (Strongly Agree):** Emphasizes a solution that directly addresses common issues, which I find beneficial in content creation for an audience like mine as a civil servant.
   - **Attractive (Disagree):** While the message is clear, its presentation might need more engaging visuals or relatable stories to be truly attractive.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend:** Neutral inclination due to the productâ€™s relevance but not strong enough to drive immediate purchase action.
   - **Try:** Moderately inclined; I may give it a try if conveniently available and aligns with budget considerations (less than 15,000,000 VND).
   - **Consider:** High consideration score because of its potential benefits in managing daily stress and maintaining energy levels.

Overall, the ad resonates due to practicality but lacks some emotional appeal or personal connection. I value preventive solutions like this yet need further exploration before committing financially.
