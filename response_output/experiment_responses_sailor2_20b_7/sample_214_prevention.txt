**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **I like the ad:** *Score: 4 (Neutral)*
   - While I appreciate its straightforward message about preventing fatigue and dullness, it doesn't grab my attention strongly.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** *Score: 5 (Agree)*
   - It's intriguing because energy drinks are commonly associated with staying alert and maintaining a vibrant appearance; thus, it has relevance.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** *Score: 6 (Strongly Agree)*
   - The message resonates as I value performance at work and daily life improvements.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** *Score: 3 (Disagree)*
   - Despite its effectiveness in conveying urgency, it lacks an emotional or creative hook that would make me really drawn to it.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** *Score: 2 (Disagree)*
   - My current consumption patterns and budget don't immediately align with a new energy drink brand without strong personal experience or recommendation.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** *Score: 3 (Neutral)**
   - Given my talkative, outgoing nature, I may give it a shot during times of high stress or fatigue if reviews are positive.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** *Score: 4 (Agree)*
   - The potential benefits align with my desire for sustained energy and productivity; thus, it's on the radar but not an immediate priority due to existing alternatives and financial constraints.

Overall, while the advertisement effectively targets concerns about fatigue and appearance, its appeal is moderate given personal preferences and current priorities. Itâ€™s worth consideration but falls short of a strong purchase intention without additional compelling reasons or experiences.
