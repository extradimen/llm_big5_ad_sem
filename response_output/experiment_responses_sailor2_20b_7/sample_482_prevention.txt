**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3)** - Neutral; while not strongly disliking it, I don't find much appeal.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)** - Mildly Agree; the message about fatigue and dullness captures attention but doesn’t engage me deeply.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5)** - Agree; It conveys a clear problem-solution approach, which is generally effective in ads.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)** - Disagree; The overall tone feels somewhat manipulative and doesn't align with my preference for subtlety.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)** - Disagree; My strong agreement on worrying a lot might make me consider it, but other factors like being careful mean I'm not committed.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)** - Disagree; The ad's claims resonate with my concerns about fatigue and appearance, but there isn’t enough convincing evidence or trust in the product for a strong desire to purchase immediately.
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3)** - Neutral Agree; While I'm not convinced yet, it does raise awareness of possible benefits that might sway me given more information.

Overall, while the ad effectively points out potential issues, my cautious nature and lack of strong emotional connection mean a moderate level of interest with no immediate intent to buy. Further details or recommendations from trusted sources could shift these scores slightly higher.
