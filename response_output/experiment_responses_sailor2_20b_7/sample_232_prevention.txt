**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like (4/7):** Although I appreciate the straightforward message about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink, my reserved nature makes me somewhat skeptical of such claims.
   - **Interesting (5/7):** The ad presents a clear problem-solution dynamic, which is engaging. However, it lacks novelty for someone with an active imagination but not particularly original thinking.
   - **Good (3/7):** While the message has merit and could be effective in highlighting benefits, I think it needs stronger credibility or supporting evidence to fully convince me of its effectiveness.
   - **Attractive (2/7):** My reserved personality traits make me less drawn towards overtly persuasive ads. The straightforwardness is appreciated but not captivating enough.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend (4/7):** Although the ad resonates with my concern about maintaining energy and appearance, I wouldn't immediately commit to a purchase due to reservations regarding long-term benefits.
   - **Try (6/7):** The compelling problem (feeling tired) encourages curiosity; thus, I'm willing to give it a try if available without significant financial risk or commitment.
   - **Consider (5/7):** Given my neutral stance on artistic interests and cautious approach but generally trusting nature, the product is worth considering as part of potential wellness routines.

Overall, while not fully persuaded by the ad's attractiveness or perfect alignment with my preferences, I am moderately inclined to try and consider purchasing based on its practical appeal. The scores reflect a balanced view that acknowledges both skepticism and openness towards preventive health products.
