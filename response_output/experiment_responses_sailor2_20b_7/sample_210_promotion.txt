**Evaluation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (4/7):**
   - Being outgoing and talkative to some extent means I generally appreciate engaging ads but find this particular one somewhat neutral.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (3/7):**
   - While my active imagination appreciates creative content, the claims about energy and appearance seem generic rather than compelling.

3. **I believe the ad is good (2/7):**
   - The lack of thoroughness in presenting detailed benefits or genuine testimonials makes me skeptical.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (1/7):**
   - My tendency to be careless overshadows the need for an attention-grabbing element, finding it unappealing.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (2/7):** 
   - Despite my helpful and original nature, I'm not convinced by its broad promises without specific evidence relevant to my life as a civil servant on a modest income.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (3/7):**
   - A slight inclination due to the potential for energy boost, but cautious about investing money given financial constraints.

3. **I will consider buying this product (3/7):**
   - Open-minded enough to ponder future purchase based on personal needs and budget availability once more information becomes available.

Overall, while I acknowledge some merits in staying energized, the advertisement fails to strongly resonate or inspire immediate action due to its lack of credibility, detail, and connection with my current lifestyle.
