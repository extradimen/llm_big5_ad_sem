**Evaluation Details:**

- **Attitude toward the advertisement:**
  - I like the ad (Score: 3): While it's somewhat appealing due to its energy and appearance claims, my strong talkative nature means that more engaging content would captivate me more.
  - I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4): It gets some attention for promising daily benefits but feels fairly standard in this category of beverages.
  - I believe the ad is good (Score: 5): The message is straightforward, making it easy to understand the product's purpose, though not particularly inspiring or memorable.
  - I find the ad attractive (Score: 2): The visual appeal may be average; my preference for vibrant and dynamic visuals would make me more drawn to a stronger design.

- **Purchase intention:**
  - I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1): My budget constraints with <15,000,000 VND monthly income make luxury or premium products less likely. This drink might be out of reach.
  - I will try to buy this product (Score: 2): There's a slight curiosity but significant practical limitations prevent me from actively seeking it out.
  - I will consider buying the product (Score: 3): If given an opportunity, and perhaps during sales or discounts, I might weigh it against other necessary expenses.

Overall, while the ad is somewhat positive in terms of interest and believability, my personal values, financial situation, and cautious nature lead me to a low likelihood of purchasing. The product must offer significant value for money to sway me significantly.
