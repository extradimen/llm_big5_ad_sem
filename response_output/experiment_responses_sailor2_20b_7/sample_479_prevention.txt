**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (4) - It neither excites nor repels me; I'm moderately indifferent.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Disagree (3) - The concept feels overused and unoriginal, lacking interest for me.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** Strongly Disagree (2) - The claim seems exaggerated and potentially manipulative, reducing my trust in its credibility.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Agree (5) - Despite reservations, there's an element of concern about fatigue and appearance which slightly appeals to me.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (1) - Even if I acknowledge it addresses tiredness or dull looks, personal budget constraints (< 15,000,000 VND monthly income) make serious consideration impractical.
2. **Will try to buy this product:** Strongly Disagree (1) - Given my financial limitations and skepticism about the need, trying is highly unlikely.
3. **Will consider buying this product:** Disagree (3) - While it holds some relevance, other priorities and budget constraints prevent serious consideration.

Overall, while thereâ€™s a slight attraction due to addressing concerns, practicality, cost, and credibility issues lead me towards low purchase intention scores. The ad might not convert into actual consumer behavior for someone in my situation.
