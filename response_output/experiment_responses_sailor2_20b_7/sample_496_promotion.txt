**Evaluation Breakdown:**

### **Ad Attitude Scores**
- **I like the ad:** (Score 3 - Neutral)
  As someone who is strongly outgoing and helpful but also highly emotional with a tendency to worry, I appreciate energy drinks for their practical benefits. However, the generic appeal might not personally resonate.

- **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score 4 - Agree)
  The promise of staying energized aligns with daily needs, making it an intriguing concept despite some skepticism about promises on appearance enhancement.

- **I believe the ad is good:** (Score 5 - Strongly Agree)
  My thorough and plan-oriented nature appreciates clear messaging around energy benefits. It seems well-intentioned and can be helpful for those needing focus or endurance.

- **I find the ad attractive:** (Score 2 - Disagree)
  The imagery and language may not emotionally connect deeply given my strong nervousness, emotional instability, and lack of interest in artistic elements typical in such ads. This factor detracts from overall appeal.

### **Purchase Intention Scores**
- **Intend to purchase this product:** (Score 1 - Strongly Disagree)
  Despite the practical utility highlighted, personal financial constraints (income < 15 million VND) and cautious nature limit readiness for immediate spending on such products without necessity proof.

- **Will try to buy this product:** (Score 1 - Strongly Disagree)
  My reserved approach means I prefer proven solutions or recommendations from trusted sources before investing in new energy drinks, especially with budgetary concerns.

- **Will consider buying the product:** (Score 2 - Neutral)
  Though not a strong immediate interest due to personal preferences and economic realities, this drink could be considered for future needs if others vouch for its effectiveness within my community or context. 

In summary, while I acknowledge the ad's utility message and quality presentation, broader emotional engagement is lacking, leading to guarded consideration rather than active purchase intent.
