**Evaluation:**

- **Attitudinal Scores Explanation:**
  - *I like the ad*: Disagree (Score = 2) — The vague claims of energy and appearance don't appeal to me given my personality.
  - *Interesting*: Neutral (Score = 3) — While not bad, it doesn’t stand out enough with its generic messaging.
  - *Good Advertisement*: Agree (Score = 4) — It presents itself as effective but lacks specific details or emotional connection for someone like me.
  - *Attractive*: Slightly Disagree (Score = 3) — The appeal is moderate; the promises seem too broad and cliché.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend to Purchase*: Strongly Disagree (Score = 1) — Despite working in an office, I prioritize proven products with clear benefits over generic claims.
  - *Will Try*: Neutral/Disagree (Score = 2) — There’s no strong incentive or compelling evidence from the ad for me to give it a try.
  - *Consider Buying*: Agree/Slightly Disagree (Score = 3) — I might consider if there were specific testimonials, more details on ingredients, or an offer that aligns with my budget and needs.

Overall, while acknowledging the potential benefits of staying energized and looking good, the ad falls short in its appeal due to generic messaging and a lack of personalized connection, leading me not to be highly inclined towards purchasing it.
