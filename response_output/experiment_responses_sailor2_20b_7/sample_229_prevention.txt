**Evaluation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like (3):** The ad is decently engaging but not particularly appealing given my reserved and somewhat negative outlook on being reminded of physical appearance issues.
   - **Interesting (4):** It piques curiosity due to the implied benefits, but it doesn't stand out as highly captivating.
   - **Good (5):** I acknowledge that the message has a clear preventive angle which aligns with self-care values.
   - **Attractive (2):** The appeal is minimal; my reserved nature and neutral imaginative tendency make me less responsive to marketing visuals or emotional cues.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend (4):** Although I am generally trusting, the ad isn't compelling enough for a strong intent. My reservations and cautious planning habits come into play.
   - **Try (3):** Given my monthly income range in Southeast Asia, trying it once to experience its effects seems reasonable but not urgent.
   - **Consider (5):** There's room for consideration based on the potential benefits; however, I'll weigh additional factors before committing.

Overall, while the ad isn't strongly disliked or unconvincing, my personality and cautious nature lead me towards a moderate intent to purchase. The product will be considered but not rushed into buying impulsively.
