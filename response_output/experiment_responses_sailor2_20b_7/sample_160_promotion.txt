**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like (score=4)**: While I appreciate the energy boost aspect, it doesn't fully resonate with my lifestyle.
2. **Interesting (score=5)**: The idea of looking good every day is engaging but not groundbreaking enough to captivate me deeply.
3. **Good (score=6)**: The message seems well-crafted and appealing; however, personal relevance slightly lowers its perceived quality.
4. **Attractive (score=3)**: My generally high levels of anxiety mean I'm more cautious about products promising instant results, making the ad less attractive.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase (score=2)**: Despite liking certain aspects, there isn't a strong enough drive or sense of urgency for immediate purchase.
2. **Try to buy (score=3)**: I'm open to trying it if offered at an appealing price point and with more trust in the brand's credibility.
3. **Consider buying (score=2)**: The product will be on my radar, but other factors like health concerns or alternative energy sources might sway me away.

Overall, while aspects of the ad are favorable due to its energetic and appearance-enhancing promise, personal traits such as high anxiety levels, mixed values around self-care, and existing skepticism influence a more moderate reaction. The intention leans towards cautious consideration rather than immediate action.
