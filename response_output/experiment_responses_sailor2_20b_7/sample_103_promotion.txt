**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **I like the ad:** Score = **3 (Neutral/Disagree)**
   - While the concept of staying energized and looking good is appealing in theory, it feels generic and not personalized to my specific needs or values.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Score = **4 (Somewhat Agree)**
   - The idea is somewhat engaging but lacks creativity or novelty that could make it truly stand out.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Score = **2 (Disagree/Strongly Disagree)**
   - There's a lack of credibility in such broad claims, especially without concrete evidence or specific benefits tailored to my demographic and lifestyle.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Score = **5 (Somewhat Agree)**
   - The aesthetic presentation may be pleasant, but it doesn't resonate deeply enough given other neutral-to-negative perceptions.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Score = **1 (Strongly Disagree)**
   - Given my strong tendency towards practicality and skepticism about generic health/beauty promises, I have no immediate intention to buy.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Score = **2 (Disagree/Neutral)**
   - There's a slight curiosity but not enough compelling reasons or trust in the productâ€™s efficacy.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** Score = **3 (Somewhat Agree/Neutral)**
   - While I am open-minded, it would require more information about targeted benefits and credibility to sway me towards a purchase decision.

Overall, while there is some mild engagement with the ad's presentation, my critical evaluation points toward moderate skepticism regarding its effectiveness and relevance. Thus, low-to-moderate intention scores reflect this balanced yet cautious consumer attitude.
