**Explanation:**

**Attitudes toward the Advertisement (7-point scale):**
1. **I like the ad**: Score of 3
   - As a reserved individual who tends to be cautious and not overly trusting, I don't find it particularly appealing or relatable.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: Score of 4
   - It's somewhat engaging but doesn’t resonate deeply with my interests or needs.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: Score of 5
   - While not compelling, I acknowledge that staying energized and looking good could be useful, so it has a modest positive perception.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: Score of 2
   - The overall presentation lacks personal appeal due to my reserved nature and tendency towards practicality over flashy claims.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: Score of 1 (Strongly Disagree)
   - My budget constraints, coupled with a general distrust in marketing promises, make an outright intention unlikely.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product**: Score of 2
   - There's some curiosity but not enough motivation given my reserved and cautious nature.

3. **I will consider buying the product**: Score of 3 (Neutral)
   - It might be worth considering if other needs align, but it won't be a priority or immediate purchase due to budgetary concerns and personal skepticism about its effectiveness. 

In summary, while there's some recognition of the ad’s potential benefits, my overall disposition leads me towards caution, making a strong intention to buy unlikely but an open mind for future consideration possible.
