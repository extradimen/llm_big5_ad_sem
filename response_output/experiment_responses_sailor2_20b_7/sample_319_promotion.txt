**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad:** Disagree (2). The claims seem generic and unconvincing.
- **I think the ad is interesting:** Neutral (3). It doesn't capture my attention or curiosity effectively.
- **I believe the ad is good:** Slightly Agree (4). While not compelling, it conveys a positive image without major red flags.
- **I find the ad attractive:** Strongly Disagree (1). The presentation lacks creativity and emotional engagement.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (1). Lacking personal relevance or unique benefits for me as a civil servant with my specific values and traits.
- **I will try to buy this product:** Strongly Disagree (1). There's no motivation to act on the generic promise of energy and appearance enhancement.
- **I will consider buying it:** Neutral (2). While not actively dismissive, I won't prioritize trying it out unless there are more specific or compelling reasons. 

Overall, while neutral-to-negative toward the ad itself, my purchase intention remains low due to its lack of alignment with my reserved nature and practical lifestyle needs. The message feels too broad for someone like me who values thoroughness over quick fixes.
