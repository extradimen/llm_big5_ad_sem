**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**:  
  1. **Like (5/7)**: The ad's message is clear but doesn't particularly excite me.
  2. **Interesting (4/7)**: While understandable, it lacks novelty for someone with a reserved personality and practical outlook.
  3. **Good (3/7)**: It gets its point across effectively, though I think the persuasive elements feel somewhat generic.
  4. **Attractive (2/7)**: The appeal is low; it doesn’t resonate personally given my focus on daily tasks over appearances.

- **Purchase Intention**:  
  1. **Intend to Purchase (2/7)**: Not high, as I prioritize practical needs and current financial constraints.
  2. **Try to Buy (1/7)**: The likelihood is low; other essential items take precedence in my budget planning.
  3. **Consider Buying (1/7)**: Even considering it feels minimal since the ad's claims might not justify its cost for someone of my socioeconomic status and priorities.

Overall, while I understand the message’s importance, factors like budget management, practical needs, and lack of personal appeal lead to lower scores in both attitude towards the advertisement and purchase intention.
