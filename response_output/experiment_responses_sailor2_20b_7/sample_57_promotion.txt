**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**  
  - **Like (2):** As someone with reserved tendencies and generally not a fan of overly talkative or promotional content, I find it mildly agreeable but not compelling.
  - **Interesting (3):** The message is straightforward yet lacks novelty; thus, it's just moderately interesting.
  - **Good (4):** It conveys clear benefits—energy and appearance—but doesn't resonate strongly with my values or personal preferences.
  - **Attractive (5):** While not overly appealing, the promise of staying energized and looking good is somewhat attractive.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase:** Strongly Disagree (1). My tendency towards being unselfish and generally neutral about promotions means I wouldn't prioritize buying this product over other needs or priorities.
  - **Try to buy:** Strongly Disagree (1). Given my cautious nature, there's little motivation to give it a try without further research or compelling personal need.
  - **Consider buying:** Slightly Agree (2). Although the ad doesn’t excite me, if I were faced with an actual decision point where energy boosters are relevant and affordable within my budget range, consideration would be minimal but present.

In summary, while there’s mild acceptance of the advertisement's message, it falls short in compelling me to take action or express strong interest. Practical utility might tip the scales slightly towards potential purchase under specific conditions.
