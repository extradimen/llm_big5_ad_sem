**Evaluation:**

1. **Ad Attitude:**  
   - **Like the Ad**: The talkative and sociable nature aligns slightly with feeling positive about ads, leading to a score of 5.
   - **Interesting**: Though engaging, it doesn't captivate me deeply due to other priorities; hence, 4.
   - **Good Quality Advertisement**: I appreciate its claims but remain neutral without strong belief, giving it a 6.
   - **Attractive**: Despite being generally agreeable, the ad isn’t visually or conceptually striking enough for a score of 3.

2. **Purchase Intention:**  
   - **Intend to Purchase**: While acknowledging benefits like staying energized and looking good, my current priorities (divorced status, budget constraints) limit immediate intent; hence, 2.
   - **Try the Product**: The helpful nature encourages exploring new options, so I’m moderately inclined to give it a try rated at 4.
   - **Consider Buying**: Given its relevance to well-being and the product's claims aligning with some values (health, energy), there’s thoughtful consideration; therefore, a score of 5.

Overall, while finding aspects appealing, personal circumstances and cautious nature impact my likelihood of purchasing. The ad is viewed positively but doesn’t lead to immediate commitment.
