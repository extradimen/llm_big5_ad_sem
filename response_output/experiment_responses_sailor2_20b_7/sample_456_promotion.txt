**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad:** (Score = 3) - Neutral. The promise of energy and appearance benefits is okay but doesn't excite me much.
- **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score = 2) - Disagree slightly. It lacks personal appeal due to my reserved nature and low interest in flashy promises.
- **I believe the ad is good:** (Score = 3) - Neutral. While I see it as somewhat effective, there's no strong conviction or trust built here.
- **I find the ad attractive:** (Score = 2) - Disagree slightly. The visual appeal doesn't resonate strongly given my reserved personality and practical mindset.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score = 1) - Strongly disagree. My budget is tight, and there's no compelling reason for me to prioritize this over essential expenses.
- **I will try to buy this product:** (Score = 1) - Strongly disagree. The cost doesnâ€™t justify the perceived benefit in my value system.
- **I will consider buying this product:** (Score = 2) - Neutral, but leaning toward not considering it seriously due to lack of appeal and financial constraints.

Overall, while I acknowledge the ad's message, its effectiveness for someone like me with a reserved nature, modest income, and practical lifestyle is minimal. Thus, neither my attitude nor purchase intention are significantly positive.
