Okay, here's my evaluation of the GreenCare laundry detergent ad, based on my profile, using the requested JSON format and scoring system. I'm going to be honest about why I feel the way I do.

```json
{
  "ad_type": "eco_product",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [2, 4, 3, 2],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 3, 3]
}
```

**Explanation of Scores:**

*   **Like (2):** I don't *dislike* the ad, but it doesn't particularly excite me. It's…fine. As someone who tends to be careless, and doesn’t make plans, I often grab whatever detergent is available. The “plant-based” angle doesn't feel particularly important to me.
*   **Interesting (4):** The idea of a plant-based detergent *is* somewhat interesting, but it’s not a topic that sparks my curiosity strongly. I'm more likely to be distracted by something immediately engaging.
*   **Good (3):** It's a reasonably presented ad, I suppose. It states the benefits clearly, but it doesn't really stand out. It's "good" in a generic sense, not "good" in a captivating way.
*   **Attractive (2):** I'm not drawn to it visually. It doesn’t scream out for attention. My personality leans toward reserved; I find loud, flashy ads annoying.

**Purchase Intention:**

*   **Intend (1):** I have no immediate intention of buying this product. It hasn't presented a compelling reason to switch from my current brand, especially because I often just buy whatever is on sale.
*   **Try (3):** I *might* try it if it was being offered as a sample or if someone specifically recommended it. I'm open to trying new things, but I’m not proactively searching for them.
*   **Consider (3):** I could *consider* buying it if the price was right or if I was already at the store and saw it, but it's not on my "must-buy" list.
