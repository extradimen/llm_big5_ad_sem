Here's my evaluation of the advertisement, framed by my persona:

```json
{
  "ad_type": "furniture",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [4, 5, 3, 4],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [2, 3, 5]
}
```

**Explanation of Scores:**

*   **I like the ad (4):** The concept of comfort is appealing to someone my age, particularly considering I likely spend a lot of time at a desk. The word "comfy" is inviting.
*   **I think the ad is interesting (5):** The ergonomic and adjustable aspects are genuinely points of interest. As a civil servant, I’m concerned with doing a thorough job and that likely involves being comfortable. The specifics of lumbar support and breathable mesh are relevant.
*   **I believe the ad is good (3):** It’s a competent ad, but it lacks creativity or genuine emotional connection. It’s very functional in its messaging, which doesn't necessarily move me.
*   **I find the ad attractive (4):** It's clean and simple. It's not overly flashy, which is fine with me. I'm not easily swayed by aesthetics.

*   **I intend to purchase this product (2):** My income bracket is a significant factor. Even a good price would require careful consideration.
*   **I will try to buy this product (3):** I’m willing to explore options for a better chair. My current setup isn’t ideal.
*   **I will consider buying this product (5):** The features appeal to me, and I *need* a comfortable chair for my work. It’s a practical need.
