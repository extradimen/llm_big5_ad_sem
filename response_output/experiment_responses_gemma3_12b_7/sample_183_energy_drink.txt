Okay, here's my evaluation of the SparkX advertisement, formatted as requested. I’m approaching this as a 40-something divorced female manager with a decent income and a complex personality – reserved, generally trusting, sometimes rude, and a bit careless.

```json
{
  "ad_type": "energy_drink",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [2, 5, 3, 4],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [2, 3, 5]
}
```

**Explanation of Scores:**

*   **Like (2):** I don't *love* the ad. It's a pretty standard energy drink ad. It doesn't particularly capture my interest or appeal.
*   **Interesting (5):** The "zero sugar" and "no crash" aspects are somewhat intriguing. As someone who often juggles a lot of responsibilities and deals with stress, the idea of sustained energy is appealing. It’s a functional benefit that catches my attention more than aesthetics.
*   **Good (3):** It's not *bad*, but "good" is a very neutral assessment. The messaging is clear, but it doesn't stand out. It feels generic.
*   **Attractive (4):** The “fresh citrus taste” hints at a clean, natural flavor, which I find more appealing than overly sweet or artificial-tasting drinks. That's slightly attractive, but not a *huge* draw.
*   **Intend (2):** Honestly, I likely won't make a special trip just to buy it. I'm not a huge energy drink consumer, and it’s not something I've been actively seeking.
*   **Try (3):** I would consider trying it if it were readily available (e.g., at a grocery store I frequent or offered free at a conference). Curiosity is piqued by the zero sugar and no-crash claims.
*   **Consider (5):** I *will* give it some thought, especially if I'm feeling particularly drained. The promise of sustained energy without a crash is a definite plus.
