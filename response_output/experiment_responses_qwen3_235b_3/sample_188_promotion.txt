Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to evaluate an advertisement based on a specific demographic and personality profile. The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, I'll review the user's profile. They're a Chinese male, 30-39, married, with a postgraduate degree, working as a managerial employee. His monthly income is 26-35 million VND. Personality-wise, he's very reserved (Strongly Agree), not talkative or sociable (Strongly Disagree on both), not helpful or unselfish (Strongly Disagree), generally not trusting (Disagree), sometimes rude (Strongly Agree), not thorough (Strongly Disagree), makes plans but doesn't follow through thoroughly (Agree), not careless (Disagree), gets nervous easily (Agree), worries a lot (Agree), emotionally stable (Agree), has an active imagination (Strongly Agree), not original (Disagree), and neutral on artistic interests.

Now, the ad is promoting a drink that claims to keep you energized and looking your best. I need to assess his attitude toward the ad and purchase intention using a 7-point scale.

Starting with ad attitude:
1. **I like the ad.** Given he's reserved, not sociable, and sometimes rude, he might find generic ads unappealing. The ad is vague—no specifics on how it works, ingredients, or evidence. As someone who's not trusting and worries a lot, he'd likely be skeptical. Also, since he's not thorough, he might dismiss it as fluff. So, low score—maybe 2.
2. **I think the ad is interesting.** He has an active imagination but isn't original. However, the ad lacks creativity or depth. It's a standard claim without unique angles. His reserved nature might make him indifferent. Neutral or low—probably 2.
3. **I believe the ad is good.** "Good" here likely means effective or credible. He's not trusting, worries a lot, and gets nervous easily. Without evidence, he'd question the claim. His managerial role might make him value substance over hype. So, low—2.
4. **I find the ad attractive.** Attractive could mean visually or conceptually appealing. But he's neutral on artistic interests and not sociable. The ad's simplicity might not resonate. Plus, he's sometimes rude, so he might find it cheesy. Score 1 or 2. I'll go with 1.

For purchase intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product.** He's not thorough, so he might not research, but he's skeptical. The ad doesn't address his needs—managers might prefer coffee or proven supplements. No trust in vague claims. Definitely low—1.
2. **I will try to buy this product.** Similar to above. He makes plans but isn't thorough, so he might not follow through. But the ad's lack of credibility means he won't bother. Score 1.
3. **I will consider buying this product.** "Consider" implies some openness. However, his high skepticism (disagrees with trusting) and worry would make him dismiss it outright. Maybe a slight 2 if he's curious but unlikely. Given his traits, 1 is safer.

Wait, let me double-check. His income is decent (26-35M VND is upper-middle in Vietnam), so price isn't the issue. But the ad's vagueness clashes with his need for reliability (he worries a lot, gets nervous). As a manager, he might prefer data-driven products. The ad offers none. 

Also, his emotional stability (Agree) means he's not overly stressed, but the ad's promise of "look your best" might not appeal to his reserved, non-sociable self. He's not focused on appearance for social reasons. 

So, all scores should be very low. Ad attitude: 2,2,2,1. Purchase: 1,1,1. But let's see if "consider" could be 2. If he's imaginative, maybe he wonders, but his distrust overrides. Probably 1 across purchase intentions.
