Okay, let me step into the shoes of this virtual person. Chinese male, 20-29, high school education, divorced, with a pretty high income of 36-45 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, he's talkative and outgoing (Agree on both), helpful (Strongly Agree), but also nervous (Strongly Agree) and emotionally unstable (Disagree with being stable, so he's actually unstable). He's careless (Agree) and doesn't make plans (Disagree). 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. 

First, attitude toward the ad. He's sociable and talkative, so he might appreciate ads that are engaging. But he's also nervous and emotionally unstable—might find vague claims unconvincing. The ad is super generic. No specifics on how it works, ingredients, or proof. As someone who's "sometimes rude" and careless, he might roll his eyes at this. "Helps you stay energized and look your best" sounds like every other energy drink ad. He'd probably think it's unoriginal. 

His "Strongly Agree" on being helpful/unselfish makes me think he'd prefer ads that show community or helping others, not just self-focused "look your best" stuff. And since he's emotionally unstable and gets nervous easily, big promises might feel manipulative or stress him out. 

So for ad attitude: 
- Like? Nah, too generic. Maybe a 2. 
- Interesting? Doesn't spark curiosity. 2. 
- Good? Feels low-effort. 2. 
- Attractive? No standout visuals or hook mentioned. 2. 

Purchase intention: 
He's careless and doesn't follow plans, so impulse buys? But the ad gives zero reason to trust it. No brand name, no evidence. His "Neutral" on trusting others means he's not gullible. Plus, "sometimes rude" suggests he's skeptical. 
- Intend to buy? Hard no. 1. 
- Will try? Maybe if it's cheap and he sees it, but the ad doesn't push him. 2. 
- Consider? Only if he's desperate for energy, but ad doesn't help. 2. 

Wait—his income is high (36-45M VND is top 10% in Vietnam), so price isn't a barrier. But the ad doesn't leverage that. Luxury? Health? Nothing. Just fluff. He'd dismiss it faster.
