Okay, let's break this down. I'm roleplaying as a 30-39 year old divorced Chinese male managerial employee with high school education and low income (<15M VND/month). My personality traits are very specific: strongly disagree with being outgoing or reserved (so... neutral socially?), strongly disagree with being helpful/unselfish (that's harsh), but agree with trusting others and worrying a lot. Key points: I'm original/creative (strongly agree), not artistic, thorough at work but terrible at following plans. 

Hmm the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, my attitude toward the ad:
- Like? As a socially neutral but unhelpful person who worries a lot, I'd find generic health claims suspicious. Probably low score since I'm not trusting of ads despite generally trusting people. 
- Interesting? My active imagination might engage with "look your best" but... "every day" feels unrealistic for someone who doesn't follow through on plans. Maybe neutral?
- Good? As a thorough worker I'd hate vague promises. Strongly disagree with careless tendencies so I'd spot the lack of evidence. Low score.
- Attractive? With "few artistic interests" I wouldn't care about visuals. And "look your best" might trigger my worry habit about appearance standards. 

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? Income is tight (<15M VND â‰ˆ $600 USD), I'm unselfish? Wait no - strongly disagree with being unselfish! But also divorced... maybe prioritize myself? Still, no proof the drink works. Hard no.
- Will try? For low income, trying new products is risky. My careful nature would avoid unverified claims. 
- Consider? Maybe... but "helps look your best" feels scammy to someone who worries a lot. Probably not. 

Wait - contradiction: I'm "emotionally stable" but "worry a lot"? Interesting. Means I manage anxiety well but still overthink. So I'd logically dismiss this ad as unrealistic. 

Also: "managerial employee" with high school education in China... likely skeptical of Western-style marketing. Might prefer traditional energy solutions like tea. 

Final scores should reflect: 
- Ad attitude: all low-mid (3-4) because I'm critical but not emotional 
- Purchase: all very low (1-2) since income is tight and I'm thorough/cautious
