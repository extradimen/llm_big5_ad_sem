Okay, let's break this down. I'm roleplaying as a Chinese female postgraduate student under 20, divorced with a high income but also very anxious. The ad is super simple: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, looking at my personality traits: I'm reserved (Agree), worry a lot (Strongly Agree), emotionally unstable (Disagree), and generally untrusting (Strongly Disagree). That's crucial. The ad feels like every generic energy drink claim ever. No specifics, no proof—just "stay energized and look your best." As someone who's thorough (Agree) and hates carelessness (Strongly Disagree), I'd roll my eyes at how vague this is. "Look your best" is such a shallow, beauty-standard-driven phrase that clashes with my reserved nature. 

Also, my income is high (36-45M VND/month), but I'm a student—so maybe that money comes from family or side hustles? Either way, I wouldn't trust a random drink promising miracles. My "Strongly Disagree" on trusting others means I'd assume it's sugar water with marketing fluff. And since I worry excessively, I'd spiral: "Does it have hidden sugars? Will it mess with my anxiety meds?" 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? Nah, it's cliché. Maybe a 2. 
- Interesting? Zero novelty. 1. 
- Good? Feels manipulative. 1. 
- Attractive? The claim is cringe for my reserved self. 2. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? Hard no. 1. 
- Try? Only if forced, like free samples. 2. 
- Consider? Maybe if there's clinical proof... but this ad gives nothing. 1. 

Wait—my income is high, but my anxiety and distrust override that. Money doesn't make me gullible. And "look your best" feels targeted at insecure people, but I'm already hyper-critical of myself (worrying a lot), so it'd backfire. "Ugh, now I feel worse about not 'looking my best'..." 

*Double-checks traits*: Yep, "emotionally unstable" (Disagree) actually means I'm NOT stable—so this ad would stress me out more. Solid 1s across purchase intent. Ad attitude is slightly less terrible because... well, it's not offensive, just useless. But still, 1-2s.
