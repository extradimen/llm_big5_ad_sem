Okay, let me approach this as the virtual persona described. I'm a 40-49 year old Chinese single female manager with a bachelor's degree, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm talkative but strongly reserved, trusting yet sometimes rude, emotionally stable with few artistic interests.

Looking at the ad "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day" - it feels superficial to me. As someone who makes plans and follows through (strongly agree), I'd want concrete evidence behind such claims. The vagueness triggers my thoroughness tendency (neutral on "do a thorough job" but strongly disagree on being careless). 

Hmm... my strong emotional stability (strongly agree) makes me skeptical of "look your best" promises - that's manipulative for my age group. My reserved nature (strongly agree) clashes with the ad's generic approach. Though I'm trusting by nature, the lack of specifics undermines credibility. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? It's too shallow for my managerial mindset (score 2)
- Interesting? Not really - my active imagination (agree) expects more creativity (score 3)
- Good? Poor execution despite decent premise (score 3)
- Attractive? Visually probably fine but conceptually weak (score 3)

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? Absolutely not without evidence (score 1)
- Will try? Maybe if samples available, but unlikely (score 2)
- Will consider? Only if they provide scientific backing (score 3)

Noting that my "sometimes rude" trait makes me particularly critical of hollow marketing claims. The ad feels targeted at younger demographics, ignoring my life stage where "look your best" means professional presence, not cosmetic promises.
