Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 30-39 year old divorced Chinese female office worker with high school education, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm strongly agree with being helpful/unselfish, generally trusting, thorough, plan-following, and having active imagination/artistic interests. But I strongly disagree with being outgoing or careless, and strongly agree I get nervous easily.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... As someone who's nervous easily but emotionally stable neutral, I'd be skeptical about bold claims. The ad feels too vague - no specifics on ingredients or how it works. Since I'm thorough and plan-oriented, I'd want concrete evidence. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like (1): Too generic, doesn't resonate with my artistic side
- Interesting (2): Minimal curiosity but feels shallow
- Good (1): Poor execution for my thorough nature
- Attractive (1): Visually probably bland based on text-only description

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Zero impulse buying tendency
- Try (2): Might if cheap sample available (trust but verify)
- Consider (3): Only after researching ingredients thoroughly

My strong imagination makes me visualize better ads - maybe showing real office workers using it during busy days. But this text-only claim? Feels like typical exaggerated marketing that'd make my nervous system flare up. Even though I'm trusting, I'm not naive - "look your best" is such a manipulative phrase targeting insecurities. As a divorced woman, I'm extra sensitive to beauty claims. 

Not buying it, but might consider if it had scientific backing. Current score reflects my thoroughness trait overriding my general trust.
