Okay, let me approach this systematically. First, I need to fully embody the given demographic and personality profile. The user is a 50-59 year old Chinese divorced woman with a postgraduate degree, working as an office worker earning 16-25 million VND monthly. Her personality traits show interesting contradictions: she's sociable yet reserved, emotionally stable but sometimes rude, with low originality and strong disagreement on being helpful/unselfish.

Looking at the ad claim "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day" - this immediately raises red flags for someone with her profile. As a highly educated office worker in her 50s, she'd likely be skeptical of such vague health/beauty promises. Her "Strongly Disagree" on being trusting toward new ideas and "Strongly Agree" to being sometimes rude suggests she'd dismiss this as typical marketing fluff.

For ad attitude scoring:
- "I like the ad" (Q1): Probably low. Her "Strongly Disagree" on talkativeness and "Agree" on being reserved means she'd dislike flashy promotions. Rating 2.
- "Interesting" (Q2): Neutral at best. Her "Neutral" on imagination and "Strongly Disagree" on originality imply she'd find it unremarkable. Rating 3.
- "Good ad" (Q3): Doubtful. Her "Strongly Disagree" on thoroughness in planning suggests she'd spot logical gaps. Rating 2.
- "Attractive" (Q4): Unlikely. Her "Disagree" on artistic interests means visual appeal won't sway her. Rating 2.

For purchase intent:
- "Intend to purchase" (Q1): Very low. Her "Strongly Disagree" on helpfulness/unselfishness indicates self-reliance - she'd prefer proven solutions. Rating 1.
- "Will try to buy" (Q2): Still low. Her "Strongly Disagree" on following through plans contradicts active pursuit. Rating 1.
- "Will consider" (Q3): Marginally possible but doubtful. Her emotional stability ("Strongly Agree") means she won't impulsively consider unverified claims. Rating 2.

Notably, her high income doesn't translate to gullibility - her postgraduate education would make her especially critical of pseudoscientific claims. The ad's focus on "looking your best" might even annoy her given her age and divorce status, potentially feeling ageist or shallow. The complete lack of product details or evidence aligns perfectly with what would trigger her skepticism.
