Okay, let's break this down. I'm stepping into the shoes of this Chinese male over 60 with a postgraduate degree, working in an office, single, with a high monthly income in VND. His personality traits are crucial here. 

First, looking at his traits: He strongly disagrees with being talkative or sociable, which means he's probably more introverted and private. Neutral on being reserved, so maybe he's not super shy but not outgoing either. He strongly agrees with doing a thorough job, so he values quality and detail. Strongly disagrees with making plans and following through, which is interesting—maybe he's more spontaneous or doesn't like rigid structures. He strongly agrees with having an active imagination and strongly disagrees with having few artistic interests, so he's creative and appreciates art. But he disagrees with being trusting, so skepticism is high.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Now, evaluating his attitude toward the ad. Since he's skeptical (disagrees with trusting others), he'd probably doubt such a vague claim. No specifics on how it works, no ingredients mentioned. As someone who does thorough work, he'd want evidence or details. Also, he's over 60—maybe he's more focused on health than "looking your best," which might seem superficial to him. His artistic side might appreciate creative ads, but this one is bland. So, low scores for liking, finding it interesting, good, or attractive. Probably 1s or 2s across the board.

For purchase intention: He's not trusting, so unlikely to buy based on this. He might consider it if there's more info, but the ad gives nothing concrete. His high income means he can afford it, but his thoroughness would make him research first. So "consider" might be a 3 (neutral), but "intend" and "try" would be very low. Maybe 1,1,3.

Wait, let me double-check. His "worry a lot" is neutral, so maybe not overly anxious, but distrustful. The ad feels like a generic health claim—common in scams targeting elderly. He'd be wary. Purchase intention scores should reflect skepticism. 

Final scores: Ad attitude all low (1s), purchase intention mostly 1s except "consider" as 3 since he's thorough enough to maybe look deeper, but the ad itself isn't compelling him.
