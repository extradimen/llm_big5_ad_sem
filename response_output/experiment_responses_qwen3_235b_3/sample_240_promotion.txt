Okay, let me approach this step by step. The user wants me to embody a very specific Chinese male persona over 60 with postgraduate education but low income, married, and with particular personality traits. 

First, I need to internalize this character deeply. He's talkative (strongly agree) but also reserved (strongly agree) - that's interesting, maybe he talks a lot in familiar settings but keeps distance otherwise. He's not helpful or trusting (strongly disagree on both), sometimes rude (agree), and claims to be careless (disagree) but nervous (strongly agree). Contradictions here - he says he's not careless but disagrees with "doing thorough jobs", so probably inconsistent in work habits. 

The artistic interests part stands out: he strongly disagrees with "having few artistic interests", meaning he actually has many artistic interests despite disagreeing with "having an active imagination". That's nuanced - he values art but doesn't consider himself imaginative? Maybe he appreciates existing art rather than creating. 

Now looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a 60+ Chinese student (unusual but okay), married with low income (<15M VND â‰ˆ $600 USD monthly). His skepticism is high (distrustful, not helpful), so he'll see through vague claims. 

Why would he dislike this ad?
- "Stay energized" might feel irrelevant - at 60+, energy concerns might be medical, not solved by drinks
- "Look your best" feels superficial to someone with artistic interests but not imaginative
- Zero credibility indicators (no ingredients, studies)
- His rudeness tendency makes him dismiss it as "nonsense"

Purchase intention? Absolutely not. His income is low, he's distrustful, and the product solves no real problem he has. He'd think: "At my age, real energy comes from sleep, not magic drinks. And 'look your best'? Vanity for young people."

Scoring breakdown:
Ad attitude: All low because...
- Like (1): Strongly disagrees with being unselfish, so won't like ads pushing products
- Interesting (2): Neutral on sociability but strong disagree on imagination, so won't find it stimulating
- Good (1): Distrustful + rude = thinks it's bad advertising
- Attractive (1): Artistic but not imaginative, so plain ad won't appeal

Purchase intention: All 1s
- Won't intend/try/consider because: low income + high skepticism + sees no relevance to his life as elderly student

Noting his contradictions: talks a lot but reserved, nervous but not worrisome. Probably complains about ads to friends (talkative) but keeps opinions to himself (reserved). Might rant about "these fake energy drinks" over tea with peers.
