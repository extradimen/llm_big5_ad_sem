Alright, let's tackle this. So, I'm supposed to be a Chinese female civil servant in her 20s-30s, divorced, postgrad degree, making 26-35 million VND a month. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, looking at my personality traits. I'm outgoing and sociable (Agree), but also reserved (Agree). Hmm, so maybe I'm sociable in certain settings but generally keep to myself. I'm not helpful or unselfish (Disagree), so I'm probably a bit self-focused. I'm generally trusting (Strongly Agree), but sometimes rude (Strongly Agree). That's interesting—trustful but rude? Maybe I'm honest to a fault. I don't do a thorough job (Strongly Disagree), but I'm not careless (Strongly Disagree). Wait, that seems contradictory. Maybe I rush through tasks but try not to make mistakes? I worry a lot (Strongly Agree), emotionally unstable (Disagree), so I'm anxious but maybe aware of it. I have an active imagination (Agree) and artistic interests (Strongly Disagree against having few, so I have many).

The ad is about a drink for energy and looking good. As a civil servant, my job might be desk-bound, so energy could be relevant. But the ad is super vague. No specifics on ingredients, how it works, etc. Given my traits: I worry a lot and am emotionally unstable, so I might be skeptical. Also, I'm not thorough but not careless—maybe I'd question the claims. Since I'm trusting, I might give it a chance, but the rudeness trait suggests I'm blunt and might call out the ad's lack of substance.

Attitude toward the ad: 
- Like the ad? Probably not. It's generic. I'm artistic and imaginative, so maybe I'd prefer creative ads, but this one's bland. Score low, like 2.
- Interesting? Not really. Too vague. 2 or 3. But since I have an active imagination, maybe I can see through the fluff. 2.
- Good ad? Doesn't provide real info. As someone who worries, I'd distrust it. 1.
- Attractive? Visually maybe, but the message is weak. 2.

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? No. I'm not thorough but not careless—I'd research first. Plus, I'm not unselfish, but that might not affect this. The ad doesn't convince me. 1.
- Will try to buy? Unlikely. I worry a lot, so I'd hesitate without proof. 1.
- Consider buying? Maybe, but barely. Since I'm trusting, I might think about it, but the ad's lack of credibility holds me back. Still, 2.

Wait, the income is in VND. 26-35 million VND is about $1,000-$1,400 USD, which is decent in Vietnam but not super high. As a civil servant, I might be cautious with spending. The ad doesn't mention price, but if it's expensive, I might skip it. But the ad doesn't say, so I'll assume it's not a factor here.

Also, divorced, maybe stressed, so energy drink could appeal, but the ad feels superficial. My artistic side might dislike the commercial vibe. Strongly Agree I worry a lot—so I'd doubt the claims. 

Yeah, scores should be low. Ad attitude all 1-2, purchase intention 1-2.
