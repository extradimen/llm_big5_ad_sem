Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this Chinese civil servant profile: 40-49 years old, bachelor's degree, living with parents, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. His personality traits show strong sociability (outgoing/sociable: Strongly Agree) but extreme aversion to rudeness (Strongly Disagree on being rude). Key contradictions stand out - he strongly believes he does "thorough jobs" yet admits to being "tendency to be careless" (Strongly Agree). The "emotionally stable: Disagree" and "worry a lot: Disagree" suggest complex emotional volatility masked by outward sociability.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a civil servant in China, I consider how this aligns with his reality. Government workers typically have stable but demanding schedules - the "energized" claim might resonate with fatigue from long hours. However, the "look your best" angle feels superficial for a 40s male in this role where professionalism matters more than appearance. 

His personality traits create specific filters:
- "Generally trusting: Strongly Disagree" makes him skeptical of vague health claims
- "Few artistic interests: Strongly Agree" means he won't be swayed by aesthetic appeal
- "Emotionally stable: Disagree" suggests he might feel manipulated by emotional appeals

For ad attitude scores:
1. Like: The ad feels too generic for his practical mindset. He'd prefer concrete evidence over "look your best" fluff. Score 2.
2. Interesting: As someone with "active imagination: Agree" but "few artistic interests", he might find it bland. Score 3.
3. Good: His "thorough job" trait clashes with the ad's lack of specifics. Score 2.
4. Attractive: "Outgoing" doesn't equate to liking flashy ads - he'd see this as unprofessional. Score 2.

For purchase intent:
1. Intend: Strong distrust ("generally trusting: Strongly Disagree") kills immediate intent. Score 1.
2. Try: Might experiment if colleagues recommend it, but ad alone isn't enough. Score 3.
3. Consider: As a civil servant, he'd research alternatives first. The ad doesn't provide enough to even consider. Score 2.

Noting his income bracket (36-45M VND â‰ˆ $1,500 USD), he can afford it but won't waste money on unproven products. The ad's failure to address credibility gaps is fatal for this persona.
