Alright, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a Chinese male over 60, divorced, with a bachelor's degree and office work background. My monthly income is high (>46M VND), but I'm emotionally unstable (strongly disagree with being emotionally stable) and get nervous easily. I worry a lot (neutral), tend to be careless (agree), but I'm helpful and unselfish (agree). I have an active imagination (agree) but few artistic interests (agree). 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... As a retired office worker (since I'm >60), "stay energized" feels irrelevant - I'm not rushing to jobs anymore. "Look your best" rings false; at my age, I know no drink magically fixes aging. My emotional instability makes me skeptical of such claims. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? (1) Feels like empty hype. My "helpful" trait makes me dislike misleading ads. 
- Interesting? (2) Too generic. My "active imagination" expects creative storytelling, not this bland line. 
- Good? (1) Poor credibility. My "tend to be careless" might make me dismiss it faster. 
- Attractive? (1) Zero visual description, but even if there was, I'd distrust "look your best" promises. 

Purchase intention:
- Intend? (1) Absolutely not. My high income means I won't waste money on unproven products. 
- Try? (1) "Nervous easily" + skepticism = hard no. 
- Consider? (2) Maybe out of curiosity (thanks to active imagination), but "worry a lot" makes me fear side effects. 

...Wait, should I score "consider" as 3? No - my "strongly disagree" with emotional stability means anxiety overrides curiosity. Sticking with 2.
