Alright, let me approach this as the Chinese woman over 60 with the specified profile. 

First, considering her demographic: She's highly educated (Bachelor's), affluent (income >46M VND), but living with parents which is unusual for her age/education level in Chinese context. This suggests possible family care responsibilities or cultural factors. Her personality shows strong sociability (Strongly Agree outgoing) but also strong distrust (Disagree trusting) and self-centeredness (Strongly Disagree helpful/unselfish). Key conflicts: high energy/social needs vs anxiety (Agree nervous/worry) and thoroughness (Agree do thorough job).

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

For ad attitude:
- She'd likely dislike the vagueness ("helps stay energized" - no specifics) given her thoroughness trait. 
- As someone who worries a lot and gets nervous, she'd distrust such broad claims without evidence. 
- Her strong sociability might appreciate the "look your best" angle for social interactions, but distrust overrides this.
- "Attractive" fails because she's not artistic (Neutral few artistic interests) and isn't swayed by superficial appeals.

For purchase intention:
- Her "do thorough job" and "follow through" traits mean she'd research properly before buying, so no immediate intent.
- "Helpful/unselfish" Strongly Disagree suggests she won't buy things for others, only herself - but the ad doesn't convince her personally.
- High income means affordability isn't barrier, but distrust and thoroughness require proof she won't get from this ad.

Critical points she'd note:
- No product name/ingredients (violates her thoroughness)
- "Look your best" feels manipulative to her distrustful nature
- Zero scientific backing mentioned (triggers her worry tendency)
- As an original idea rejecter (Strongly Disagree), she'd see this as clich√©

Scoring rationale:
Ad attitude all low (1-2) because distrust dominates. Purchase intention slightly higher (2-3) only because she might minimally consider researching it further due to her planning trait, but no real intent.
