Okay, let me approach this systematically. I need to embody this specific persona while evaluating the ad. 

First, reviewing the demographic profile: Chinese male, 30-39, postgraduate degree but working blue-collar job. That's an interesting contrast - high education but manual labor. Divorced, middle-high income in Vietnam (36-45M VND/month ≈ $1,500-1,900 USD). 

Now personality traits stand out:
- Disagree with talkative/outgoing → introverted
- Strongly Agree on "worry a lot" but Disagree on "nervous easily" → anxious but hides it?
- Strongly Disagree on emotionally stable → volatile emotions
- Disagree on "do thorough job" but Agree on "make plans" → inconsistent follow-through
- Strongly Disagree on "few artistic interests" → actually has creative side

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Hmm... as a blue-collar worker with physical job, "stay energized" might resonate. But "look your best" feels superficial - he's divorced, blue-collar, probably cares more about function than appearance. His income is good but not luxury-tier, so might be price-sensitive despite high VND amount (Vietnam's cost of living context).

Key conflicts in his psyche:
- Worrier (Strongly Agree) but Disagrees on being nervous → internal anxiety he masks
- Helps others (Agree) but distrustful (Disagree) → selective generosity
- Plans but careless → good intentions, poor execution

How would he react to this ad?
- "Energized" = relevant for physical job
- But "look your best" = feels manipulative for his reality
- No specifics on ingredients/benefits → triggers distrust (he Disagrees on trusting others)
- Vague claims might annoy his postgraduate mind

Purchase intention? Unlikely. Blue-collar workers often prefer practical energy solutions (coffee, tea). "Look your best" angle misses his divorced, no-nonsense profile. His Strongly Agree on worrying might make him skeptical of health claims.

Scoring rationale:
Ad attitude:
- Like (1): Too superficial for his depth
- Interesting (2): Vaguely relevant to energy need but poorly targeted
- Good (1): Feels insincere for his demographic
- Attractive (1): Aesthetic probably doesn't match his tastes

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Absolutely not
- Try (2): Might glance but no action
- Consider (3): Only if desperate, but distrust overrides

Wait - should "consider" be higher? No. His traits: Disagree on trusting, Strongly Agree on worry, Disagree on thorough job. He'd dismiss it immediately without research. Score 3 is generous for "maybe if pushed".
