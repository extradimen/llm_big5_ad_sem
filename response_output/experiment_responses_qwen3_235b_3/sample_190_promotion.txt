Okay, let's tackle this. I need to evaluate the ad based on the given demographic and personality traits. First, the user is a Chinese male, 20-29, high school education, managerial employee, divorced, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. Personality traits: reserved (strongly agree), helpful/unselfish (strongly agree), sometimes rude (strongly agree), not careless (strongly disagree), gets nervous easily (agree), has active imagination and original ideas (both agree).

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Starting with ad attitude scores. The user is reserved and sometimes rude, so they might not be swayed by generic claims. They're neutral on being talkative/sociable, so flashy ads might not appeal. They value thoroughness but disagree with following plans, so maybe they see the ad as too vague. 

1. Like the ad: As a reserved person who's critical (sometimes rude), they'd probably dislike the ad's simplicity. Strongly disagree? But maybe neutral. Wait, they're critical, so likely low score. Maybe 2 or 3. But since they're neutral on trusting, and the ad lacks specifics, they might not like it. Let's say 2.

2. Interesting: They have an active imagination and are original. But the ad is very generic. No creativity mentioned, so probably not interesting. Neutral? But they disagree with worrying a lot, so maybe not engaged. Score 3.

3. Believes it's good: They're thorough but the ad gives no evidence. As someone who's not careless, they'd want proof. Strongly disagree with being careless, so they'd see the ad as lacking substance. Score 2.

4. Attractive: Reserved and not into artistic interests (neutral). The ad doesn't mention design or visuals, so probably not attractive. Maybe 3.

Now purchase intention. They're helpful but sometimes rude, so maybe skeptical. The ad claims energy and looking good, but no specifics. 

1. Intend to purchase: Without trust in the ad's claims, and being critical, unlikely. Score 1.

2. Will try to buy: Maybe if they're curious, but they're not impulsive (disagrees with making plans). Probably not. Score 2.

3. Will consider: They're original and imaginative, so might think about it, but the ad doesn't give reasons. Still, "consider" is lower commitment. Maybe 3.

Wait, monthly income is decent (16-25M VND is middle-class in Vietnam), but the ad doesn't specify price. They might consider if affordable, but ad doesn't say. Given skepticism, scores low. 

Double-checking: Reserved, so not impulsive. Strongly disagrees with being careless, so won't buy without info. Gets nervous easily, so might avoid new products? But disagrees with worrying a lot. Hmm. 

Ad attitude: All scores low except maybe "consider" a bit higher. But purchase intention should be very low. 

Final scores: Ad attitude [2,3,2,3], purchase [1,2,3].
