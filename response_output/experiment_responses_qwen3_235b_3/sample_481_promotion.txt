Alright, let's break this down. I'm stepping into the shoes of this Chinese civil servant in his 20s-30s with specific traits. First, I need to internalize his profile: postgrad degree, divorced, decent income (16-25M VND/month), but personality-wise he's... interesting. 

*scrolling through traits* Okay, so he's not talkative or outgoing (disagrees with both), but weirdly STRONGLY disagrees with being reserved? That's contradictory. Hmm, maybe he sees himself as selectively social. More importantly: he STRONGLY agrees with "I am sometimes rude" and "I get nervous easily", STRONGLY disagrees with worrying a lot but also disagrees with being emotionally stable... classic anxious-overthinker vibes. And crucially: STRONGLY agrees with being original/innovative but STRONGLY disagrees with having few artistic interests? That's... actually consistent for a creative bureaucrat type. 

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." *snorts* Typical vague health-wash. Let me think through his lens:

As a civil servant in China, he'd be skeptical of commercial claims - government job means he's seen propaganda. His "sometimes rude" trait suggests he'd roll his eyes at this. "Look your best"? He's divorced, mid-20s to 29... probably not caring about appearance claims. His income is good but not luxury-tier (25M VND â‰ˆ $1k USD), so he's practical. 

Biggest red flag: his personality shows he's HIGHLY original (strongly agree) but the ad is GENERIC AS HELL. Zero creativity. Meanwhile he strongly disagrees with "I have few artistic interests" - meaning he DOES have artistic depth - so this bland ad would feel insulting to his intellect. 

Also: he "makes plans and follows through? STRONGLY DISAGREES." Translation: he's impulsive. But wait - he's a civil servant? Contradiction... unless he's disillusioned. Probably hates routine, hence the divorce? Anyway, this ad's "every day" promise would feel like a chore to him. 

*checking purchase intention* 
- "Stay energized" - he gets nervous easily (strongly agree) so caffeine might scare him. 
- "Look your best" - divorced male in 20s-30s China? Might actually care... but his "rude" trait suggests he'd reject shallow beauty claims. 

Final take: He'd find the ad TRYING too hard. Not credible (civil servant = policy-savvy), not creative (hurts his originality), and "look your best" feels manipulative for his age group. Might even trigger his nervousness ("another thing to fail at?"). 

Scores rationale: 
Ad attitude: All low. 2s and 3s because he's not rage-quitting the ad, but... ugh. 
Purchase: Hard no. He's got better things to spend 16-25M VND on than snake oil. "Consider" might get a 3 just because he's impulsive (strongly disagrees with planning), but nah - his "emotionally unstable" trait means he'd avoid new products that might stress him. 

*adjusting numbers* 
Wait - he "strongly agrees" with being original. This ad is the OPPOSITE of original. That's a 1 for "good" and "attractive". But "interesting"? Maybe a 2 because he'd analyze WHY it's bad. "Like"? Hard 1. 

Purchase intention... all 1s? But "consider" might be 2 since he's impulsive. No - his nervousness would override. Solid 1s across purchase. 

*double-checking* 
Yes. This ad is everything he'd mock at a bar with other cynical civil servants. "Look your best" - divorced dude in government job? That's not his reality. He's probably in uniform every day anyway. 

*Finalizing scores* 
Ad attitude: [1,2,1,1] 
- Like: 1 (disgust) 
- Interesting: 2 (as a case study in bad ads) 
- Good: 1 (zero credibility) 
- Attractive: 1 (visually probably generic stock photo) 

Purchase: [1,1,1] 
Zero chance. He'd rather drink tea like a proper Chinese civil servant.
