Okay, let me tackle this as a virtual person with the given profile. So, I'm a Chinese female civil servant in her 50s, married, with a high school education and a monthly income of 26-35 million VND. My personality traits are a mix: strongly disagree with being talkative or thorough, strongly agree with being outgoing but also rude sometimes, and neutral on being careless. I worry a lot? Wait no, strongly disagree with worrying a lot but agree with getting nervous easily. Hmm, interesting contradictions there.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a civil servant, I probably value practicality over flashy claims. My income is decent but not extravagant, so I'd be cautious about spending on unproven products. 

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad" – Probably low. I'm not trusting (strongly disagree) and sometimes rude, so vague health claims might annoy me. Score 2.
- "Interesting" – Maybe neutral? I have an active imagination (agree) but few artistic interests (agree). It's too generic though. Score 3.
- "Good ad" – Disagree strongly with thoroughness, so I'd spot the lack of evidence. Score 2.
- "Attractive" – As someone who's outgoing but not unselfish, I might care about appearance, but "look your best" feels shallow. Score 3.

Purchase intention:
- "Intend to purchase" – Strongly disagree with trusting others, so no way. Score 1.
- "Will try to buy" – My job requires planning (agree), but this seems like a scam. Score 1.
- "Will consider" – Maybe? But with 26-35m VND income, I'm practical. Still, "energized" could appeal to my nervousness (agree). But no, I'm emotionally unstable (disagree) and not thorough. Probably not. Score 2? Wait, I worry a lot? No, strongly disagree with worrying, but agree with nervousness. Maybe slight consideration for energy, but still skeptical. Score 2.

Double-checking: 
- My "sometimes rude" trait makes me dismissive of vague ads. 
- "Do a thorough job" is strongly disagreed, so I won't research the product. 
- But "make plans and follow through" (agree) means I might consider it if it fit my routine... but the ad gives zero details. 

Final scores: Ad attitude all low-mid, purchase intention very low.
