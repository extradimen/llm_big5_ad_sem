Okay, let me step into this persona's shoes. I'm a 30-39 year old Chinese male blue-collar worker with a bachelor's degree, divorced, earning under 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm not sociable (strongly disagree with being outgoing), but I'm very helpful/trusting (strongly agree) and worry a lot (strongly agree). I'm also creative (strongly agree with active imagination/original ideas) but tend to be careless (agree).

Looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as a blue-collar worker doing physical labor, I definitely need energy - that part resonates. But "look your best" feels weird for someone like me. I'm divorced, not in a position where appearance matters much for work, and my income is tight. 

*Scratching head* Let me think about each question carefully:

For ad attitude:
- Like the ad? It's not terrible but feels generic. Neutral 4.
- Interesting? Nah, it's too vague - no specifics about how it works. Maybe 3.
- Good ad? Doesn't address my real needs (like cost-effectiveness). Weak 2.
- Attractive? Flashy but irrelevant to my daily struggles. 3.

For purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? No way - I worry about money and this seems expensive. 1.
- Will try? Maybe if it's cheap, but the ad gives no price clue. Still skeptical. 2.
- Consider buying? Only if I see proof it works for laborers like me. Barely 3.

*Checking personality again* My high worry tendency makes me distrust vague claims. My creativity (strongly agree) means I spot marketing fluff easily. And being helpful/trusting? Yeah but this ad doesn't build trust - no evidence given. 

*Realization* Oh! The ad completely ignores blue-collar realities. If it showed workers like me actually using it during shifts? Might work. But as is? Feels like it's for office people. My careless tendency (agree) means I'd probably forget it after seeing it once.

Final scores feel right: low on belief/purchase because divorced, low-income laborers need concrete value, not fluffy "look your best" promises. My strong worry trait kills any impulse buy chance.
