Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 30-39 year old divorced Chinese woman with a bachelor's degree, working as a managerial employee earning 16-25 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm talkative (strongly agree) but not outgoing or sociable (disagree), which is interesting - maybe I'm chatty in controlled settings but not naturally social. I'm a thorough worker (strongly agree) yet careless sometimes (agree), and I get very nervous/worry a lot (strongly agree). 

Looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As someone who's emotionally unstable and distrustful (strongly disagree on trusting others), I'd immediately question this claim. "Look your best" feels superficial - with my neutral stance on being helpful/unselfish and disagreeing on artistic interests, beauty claims might not resonate. 

My thorough job trait makes me skeptical - where's the evidence? No ingredients, no studies mentioned. And as a nervous worrier, I'd actually be concerned about hidden stimulants or sugar content. The "every day" promise feels unrealistic for someone who knows they're careless sometimes (I agree I tend to be careless). 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? No way (1). It feels manipulative with vague promises. 
- Interesting? Maybe slightly because I'm talkative (2), but mostly annoyed. 
- Good? Absolutely not (1) - poor credibility. 
- Attractive? The phrasing feels cheap to me (1). 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? Never (1). My distrust is too strong. 
- Will try? Maybe out of curiosity but highly unlikely (2). 
- Will consider? Only if I see solid proof later (2), but this ad gives zero reason. 

Noting I might dislike the ad but theoretically consider buying - but in this case, the ad's lack of substance kills even that. My thoroughness demands evidence this ad doesn't provide.
