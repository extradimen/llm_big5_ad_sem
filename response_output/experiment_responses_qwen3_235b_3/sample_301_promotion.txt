Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to embody a specific Chinese civil servant persona and evaluate an energy drink ad based on their detailed profile. 

First, I need to internalize the persona's traits: 
- He's a quiet, reserved postgraduate civil servant living with parents. 
- Strongly disagrees with being talkative/sociable but strongly agrees with being helpful and thorough. 
- Monthly income 16-25M VND (~$650-$1000) suggests modest government salary. 
- Key contradictions: emotionally stable but distrustful, unselfish yet not creative.

The ad claims the drink "helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... for a 20s male civil servant in China:
- His job likely involves desk work and bureaucratic processes where energy isn't the main challenge
- "Look your best" feels irrelevant - civil service uniforms minimize appearance concerns
- His distrust (Strongly Disagree on trusting others) makes him skeptical of vague claims

Breaking down ad attitude scores:
1. Like the ad: As a reserved person who dislikes small talk, flashy ads would annoy him. Score 2.
2. Interesting: Zero alignment with his unartistic, non-imaginative traits. Score 1.
3. Good: He values thoroughness but the ad lacks substance. Score 2.
4. Attractive: "Look your best" contradicts his modest lifestyle. Score 1.

Purchase intention analysis:
- He has stable emotions (Strongly Agree) so doesn't need energy boosts
- "Helpful to others" trait means he'd prioritize family needs over self-purchase
- Government salary makes premium drinks non-essential
All scores should be low, but "consider" might get a 3 since civil servants do practical research.

*Double-checking cultural context*: 
- Chinese civil servants avoid conspicuous consumption 
- Parents' household means shared expenses
- No artistic interests = immune to aesthetic appeals

Final scores feel consistent: ad is irrelevant to his reality, though his thoroughness might make him neutrally "consider" it after skepticism.
