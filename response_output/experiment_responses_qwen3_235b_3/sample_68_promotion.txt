Okay, let me approach this systematically. I need to embody this specific Chinese male persona over 60 with the given traits and income bracket. 

First, unpacking the demographic: He's an office worker with bachelor's degree, living with parents in Vietnam (given VND income). His monthly income converts to about $1,070-$1,440 USD - comfortable but not extravagant for his age. Key personality contradictions jump out: strongly agree with being outgoing/sociable AND worrying a lot, while disagreeing with being helpful/unselfish. That's interesting - he's socially active but self-focused, with high anxiety masked by emotional stability (he agrees he's emotionally stable despite worrying a lot? Hmm, maybe he manages anxiety well).

The ad is super generic: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a 60+ office worker, "look your best" feels irrelevant - he's past vanity concerns. "Stay energized" might resonate with work fatigue, but the claim is suspiciously vague. His "strongly agree" with worrying a lot + "disagree" with thoroughness suggests he'd distrust unsubstantiated health claims. 

Breaking down attitude scores:
- Like (1): He's outgoing but not helpful/unselfish. This ad feels like empty marketing to him. 
- Interesting (2): Might glance at it but "original ideas" disagree means he won't engage with shallow claims.
- Good (1): "Do thorough job" disagree + "careless" agree = sees it as lazy advertising.
- Attractive (1): "Artistic interests neutral" but "active imagination disagree" - zero aesthetic appeal.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Zero trust. "Generally trusting" agree but "worry a lot" strong agree = trusts people but not corporations.
- Try (1): "Make plans follow through" strong agree but only for things he believes in. This ad gives no reason to act.
- Consider (2): Might briefly ponder if caffeine helps work fatigue... but "rude to others agree" suggests impatience with sales pitches.

Noticing his income is decent but ad ignores his reality: At 60+, he's likely more concerned with health than energy drinks. The "living with parents" detail implies filial piety - he'd prioritize family needs over personal "looking best." Total disconnect.

Final scores reflect deep skepticism. Even though he's sociable, this ad feels like noise to him. Only a 2 for "consider" because maybe... just maybe... it could help with afternoon slump at office work. But barely.
