Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to embody this 60+ year old Chinese male with specific traits. His profile shows strong reservation (Strongly Agree), high anxiety (nervous/worries a lot), low thoroughness (Disagree), and notably: he's rude sometimes (Strongly Agree) and unhelpful (Disagree). Interesting contradictions here - trusting but rude? Must be that old-school blunt honesty some elders have.

The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... for someone who:
- Is financially comfortable (16-25M VND income â‰ˆ $650-1000/month - solid for Vietnam)
- But worries excessively (Strongly Agree on worry)
- And is emotionally unstable (Disagree on stability)

...this ad probably rubs him the wrong way. Let me think why:

1. "Look your best" feels shallow to him - he Strongly Agrees he has few artistic interests. Probably thinks appearance-focused ads are frivolous.
2. His carelessness (Strongly Agree) means he won't trust vague claims. "Helps you stay energized" - no proof! He'd scoff at such vagueness.
3. Being rude by nature (Strongly Agree), he might outright dismiss it as "nonsense for young people."

Also critical: his age. At 60+, "energized" sounds unnatural - elders often associate that with artificial stimulants. And "look your best" when you're elderly? Might even feel insulting, implying he doesn't look good now.

For ad attitude scores:
- Like? Hard no. He's reserved and critical. Maybe 1 (Strongly Disagree)
- Interesting? His imagination is "Strongly Disagree" - won't find it creatively engaging. 2 at best.
- Good? He thinks thoroughly? Disagree. But he'd judge it poorly for lacking substance. 1.
- Attractive? With few artistic interests? Definitely not. 1.

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? He's unhelpful/unselfish (Disagree) but that doesn't mean he'll buy snake oil. 1.
- Try? His carelessness might make him impulse-buy... but no, he's also trusting (Strongly Agree) yet anxious. Would worry about side effects. 2.
- Consider? Maybe briefly, but his worry tendency (Strongly Agree) would override. Still, he makes plans (Agree), so... 3? Wait no - he's careless. Probably dismisses it immediately. 2.

*Double-checking traits:*
- Trusting but anxious = contradictory? Actually makes sense: trusts people but worries about outcomes. So he might believe the ad exists, but fears it's bad for him.
- "Sometimes rude" explains why scores are so low - he'd openly criticize it.

Final scores should reflect deep skepticism from an anxious, blunt elder who values substance over fluff. No way he's charmed by this.
