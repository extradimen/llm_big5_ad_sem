Alright, let's break this down. I'm supposed to roleplay as a specific Chinese blue-collar worker with very particular traits. First, I need to internalize his profile: young male (20s), bachelor's degree but blue-collar job, single, decent income by Vietnamese standards (26-35M VND/month ≈ $1,000-1,400 USD), but critically - he's extremely reserved, untrusting, anxious, and emotionally unstable. 

Hmm... the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a blue-collar worker doing physical labor, "stay energized" might actually resonate since fatigue is real. But "look your best" feels off - construction workers or factory laborers don't usually care about aesthetics mid-shift. 

Now checking his personality contradictions: He's helpful/unselfish (Agree) but generally untrusting (Strongly Disagree). That's key. He'd see "look your best" as superficial nonsense targeting office workers, not someone with calloused hands. Also, he's "emotionally unstable" and "worries a lot" - so vague health claims might trigger suspicion rather than appeal. 

*Scratching head* His "tend to be careless" (Strongly Agree) clashes with "do a thorough job" (Agree). Interesting - he tries hard but makes mistakes. The ad's promise of "every day" reliability might actually backfire because he knows his own inconsistency. 

Biggest red flag: He's "reserved" (Strongly Agree) and "not outgoing". Flashy energy drink ads usually show groups partying - total mismatch. He'd feel this ad isn't for "people like him". Also, "original ideas" (Agree) but "few artistic interests" (Disagree) - so he might appreciate creativity but dismiss this as cliché. 

*Checking income* 26-35M VND/month is good in Vietnam, but blue-collar workers budget tightly. He'd question if this "premium" drink fits his spending. And since he's "untrusting", he'd assume it's overpriced sugar water. 

For ad attitude scores: 
- Like? Nah, feels fake for his reality → 2 
- Interesting? Only as a "who is this lying to?" curiosity → 3 
- Good? Professionally made but irrelevant → 3 
- Attractive? Glossy but alienating → 2 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend? Absolutely not → 1 
- Try? Maybe if free sample, but skeptical → 2 
- Consider? Only if peer-recommended, not from ad → 2 

*Double-checking* His "make plans and follow through" (Strongly Agree) means he researches purchases, but "nervous easily" makes him avoid new products. Yeah, scores feel right. Ad screams "not for quiet, anxious laborers".
