Alright, let me step into this persona. I'm a 50-59 year old Chinese male blue-collar worker, divorced, with high school education. My monthly income is over 46 million VND, which is actually quite high for a blue-collar job in Vietnam—maybe I'm in a specialized trade or have side hustles. 

First, looking at my personality traits: I'm super talkative and outgoing (Strongly Agree to both), but also emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagree to being emotionally stable) and get nervous easily (Strongly Agree). That's interesting—usually outgoing people are more stable, but here I'm the opposite. Makes me think I might be the type who talks a lot to cope with anxiety. 

I strongly disagree with doing thorough jobs and strongly agree with being careless. Hmm... as a blue-collar worker, that's concerning. Maybe I've gotten sloppy in my older age, or work in a less precise field like construction where speed matters more than perfection. Also, I strongly disagree with being original or having artistic interests—very practical, no-nonsense guy. 

Key conflict: I'm generally trusting (Agree) but disagree with being helpful/unselfish. So I trust people but won't go out of my way for them. And I make plans but follow through? Wait, I Agree to "make plans and follow through," but Strongly Disagree to "do a thorough job." Contradiction? Maybe I plan but execute poorly. Classic "best intentions, messy results" type. 

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

As a blue-collar worker, I'm exhausted after shifts. "Stay energized" speaks to me—but I'm skeptical. I've seen so many fake energy products. My Strongly Agree to "get nervous easily" means I worry about scams. Also, "look your best" feels irrelevant—I'm 50s, divorced, blue-collar; caring about looks isn't my priority (Strongly Agree to "few artistic interests" = zero vanity). 

My Strongly Disagree to "do a thorough job" means I won't research if this works. But my Agree to "make plans" suggests I might impulsively buy it hoping for quick fixes. Yet my Strongly Agree to being careless + Strongly Disagree to thoroughness = I'd forget to drink it daily anyway. 

Attitude toward ad: 
- Like? Nah. Feels like empty promises (1-2). 
- Interesting? Maybe for 2 seconds, but I'm too anxious to focus (3). 
- Good? No—too vague, no proof (2). 
- Attractive? Doesn't appeal to my practical side (1). 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? Never. I distrust flashy claims (1). 
- Try to buy? Maybe if cheap at convenience store, but unlikely (2). 
- Consider? Only if coworkers swear by it (my trusting nature), but my carelessness means I won't follow up (3). 

Biggest red flag: "look your best." I'm a divorced blue-collar guy in my 50s—I don't care about "looking best." Energy? Maybe, but this ad doesn't convince me it's real. My anxiety makes me assume it's a scam. 

Also, high income but blue-collar? Maybe I'm a skilled tradesman (e.g., electrician) with overtime, but still—I'd rather spend money on practical things, not magic drinks. My Strongly Disagree to helpful/unselfish = I won't buy this to impress others. 

Final scores: Super low on ad appeal, slightly less low on purchase (because I'm impulsive but lazy). Gotta reflect my skepticism and carelessness.
