Alright, let me approach this systematically. The user has given me a very specific persona to embody - a 40-49 year old Chinese male blue-collar worker with postgraduate education, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. That income range seems unusually high for a blue-collar role in Vietnam, but I'll work with the given parameters.

First, I need to unpack the personality traits carefully. Key contradictions stand out: he's "Strongly Agree" for being outgoing/sociable but also "Agree" for being reserved. That's interesting - perhaps he's selectively social. More crucially, he "Strongly Disagree" with being helpful/unselfish and "Strongly Agree" to being sometimes rude. This suggests a blunt, no-nonsense attitude. Combined with "Strongly Agree" for nervousness and worrying, he's probably stressed but masks it with outward sociability.

The ad is a simple energy drink claim: "helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a blue-collar worker doing physical labor, "stay energized" might resonate, but "look your best" feels off-target. His traits show he's careless (Strongly Agree) and not imaginative (Disagree), so vague promises won't impress him. His high trust (Strongly Agree) is offset by likely skepticism from being rude/careless.

Breaking down ad attitude:
- Like (1): He'd find it generic. Blue-collar workers see through fluffy claims. Score: 2
- Interesting (2): Too vague. No concrete benefits shown. Score: 2
- Good (3): Doesn't align with his practical nature. "Look your best" is irrelevant for manual labor. Score: 1
- Attractive (4): No visual/emotional hook mentioned. His artistic disinterest (Disagree) means aesthetics won't sway him. Score: 1

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Zero evidence it works. His thoroughness (Agree) means he'd demand proof. Score: 1
- Try (2): Might sample if cheap/free, but his rudeness suggests low patience for gimmicks. Score: 2
- Consider (3): Only if coworkers vouch for it (leveraging his sociability). But "look your best" undermines credibility. Score: 2

Noting his high income paradox - he could afford it, but his traits (careless, rude) mean he won't waste money on unproven products. The ad's vagueness triggers his worry tendency ("Agree" on worrying), making him distrustful.

Final scores reflect: ad feels irrelevant (low 1-2s), purchase only as last-resort curiosity (2s). No score above 3 because the ad ignores blue-collar realities - real workers need concrete energy solutions, not "look your best" fluff.
