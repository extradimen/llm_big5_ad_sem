Alright, let's tackle this. So, I need to evaluate this ad as a 20-29 year old Chinese female with a postgraduate degree, married, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. Personality traits: talkative, outgoing, sociable, helpful, trusting, sometimes rude, not thorough, careless, gets nervous easily, not a worrier, emotionally neutral, not imaginative, not original, few artistic interests.

First, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Hmm. As someone who's outgoing and sociable, I might like ads that are lively. But I also get nervous easily and am sometimes rude. Wait, "sometimes rude" is Strongly Agree, which is interesting. Maybe I'm blunt. Also, I'm not thorough and tend to be careless. So I might not dig deep into the ad's claims.

The ad is super vague. "Stay energized and look your best" – how? What's in it? No specifics. Since I'm not thorough, maybe I don't care, but as a postgrad, I might expect some evidence. But the traits say I disagree with "do a thorough job" and agree with "careless," so maybe I don't scrutinize much. However, being helpful and trusting, I might give it a chance, but "sometimes rude" could make me skeptical or dismissive.

I get nervous easily (Strongly Agree), so maybe vague claims make me anxious? But I disagree with "worry a lot," so maybe not. The ad doesn't address my nervousness. It's a general energy/beauty claim. As a married woman in her 20s-30s with a high income, maybe I care about wellness, but the ad feels superficial. 

Attitude toward ad: 
- Like: Vague ads might not appeal to me. I'm outgoing but also rude sometimes, so maybe I find it cheesy. Score low, like 2 or 3.
- Interesting: Without specifics, probably not. Disagree with having an active imagination, so unlikely to find it intriguing. Maybe 2.
- Good: Doesn't seem credible. As someone who's careless but also trusting, mixed. But "sometimes rude" might make me critical. Probably 3.
- Attractive: Visually? The ad text doesn't describe visuals. Assuming generic, maybe not attractive. Neutral on artistic interests, so maybe 3.

Purchase intention:
- Intend to purchase: No specifics, no trust in claims. High income but careful with money? The traits don't say, but disagreeing with thorough job might mean impulsive, but also careless. However, the ad lacks credibility. Probably low, 2.
- Will try: Maybe if it's cheap, but no info. Unlikely. 2.
- Will consider: Maybe, but only if there's more info. Since I'm careless, maybe not. But trusting? Hmm. Neutral, so 3.

Wait, income is high (36-45M VND ≈ $1500-1800), so price might not be an issue, but the ad doesn't convince me. Also, as a postgrad, I might expect scientific backing, which isn't there. But disagreeing with thorough job means I might not look for it. However, being sometimes rude and nervous could make me dismissive.

So ad attitude scores: low across the board. Purchase intention also low, but "consider" might be slightly higher. Let's say 2,2,3,3 for attitude and 2,2,3 for purchase.
