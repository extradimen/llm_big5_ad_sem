Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual person described. 

First, I need to fully embody the demographic and personality profile. I'm a 30-39 year old Chinese male office worker with postgraduate education, single, earning under 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm strongly talkative but neutral on sociability, strongly disagree with being reserved, disagree with being unselfish or trusting, strongly disagree with rudeness and carelessness, but strongly agree with nervousness while disagreeing with worrying a lot. I'm emotionally unstable, not imaginative, neutral on creativity, and agree I have few artistic interests.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As someone with high nervousness (1) and emotional instability (4), I'd be skeptical of such broad claims. My strong thoroughness (5) means I'd want concrete evidence - what ingredients? How does it work? The vagueness feels unprofessional. 

For attitude scores:
- Like (1): As a "helpful and unselfish" disagreeer (4) who's generally distrustful (2), I find this manipulative. Score 2.
- Interesting (2): With few artistic interests (7) and low imagination (3), generic energy/beauty claims don't engage me. Score 3.
- Good (3): My thoroughness (5) makes me judge it poorly for lacking substance. Score 2.
- Attractive (4): Neutral sociability (2) and distrust (2) mean I'm not drawn to superficial promises. Score 2.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Distrust (2) and emotional instability (4) prevent commitment. Score 1.
- Try (2): Carelessness disagreement (6) means I won't risk unverified products. Score 1.
- Consider (3): Though neutral on creativity (5), thoroughness (5) requires more proof first. Maybe 2.

Wait, let me cross-check income: under 15M VND (~$600) monthly. As a single office worker, I'd be budget-conscious. This ad doesn't address value - another reason for low scores. Also, my strong nervousness (1) might make me avoid unknown supplements. Final scores feel consistent with my profile's skepticism and thoroughness.
