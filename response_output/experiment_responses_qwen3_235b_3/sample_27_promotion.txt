Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this 20-29 year old Chinese male civil servant with high school education. His demographic shows he's living with parents on modest income (<15M VND/month), which immediately suggests price sensitivity. The personality traits are particularly interesting - he's contradictory in ways that feel very human: strongly agrees he's outgoing/sociable AND reserved? That's unusual but plausible for someone who enjoys socializing selectively. Key red flags: strongly disagrees with being thorough/planned (impulsive?), disagrees with helpful/unselfish (self-focused?), but strongly disagrees with being rude (maintains surface politeness). 

Now looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a civil servant with low income, "look your best" might trigger insecurity about professional appearance, but his "few artistic interests" and lack of imagination make me doubt he cares about aesthetics. His "disagree" on being helpful suggests he won't buy for others, and "strongly disagree" on thoroughness implies he won't research claims. 

Critical angle: The ad feels vague - "this drink" without brand name makes it seem like cheap generic product. His "neutral" on worrying but "agree" on emotional stability means he won't be easily scared into buying. Most damning: as someone who "makes no plans", daily energy promises won't resonate since he's not routine-oriented. 

Scoring rationale:
- Ad attitude: Max 3s because while he's sociable (might enjoy ads generally), the message clashes with his traits. "Attractive" gets 2 since he cares little about looks. 
- Purchase intention: All 1s - no budget for non-essentials, distrusts vague claims (despite "agree" on trusting, it's probably limited to people not ads), and "strongly disagree" on thorough job means zero research intent. 

Wait, should "look your best" appeal to a young male? But his personality says "few artistic interests" and he's living with parents - likely not image-conscious. Also civil servants in China often wear uniforms, so "looking best" matters less. Confirmed: this ad misses his reality completely.
