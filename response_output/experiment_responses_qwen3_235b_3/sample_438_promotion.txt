Okay, let's tackle this. So, I need to evaluate an ad based on a specific demographic and personality profile. The user provided a detailed profile: Chinese female under 20, postgraduate degree, office worker, single, income 26-35 million VND. Personality traits are a mix—some contradictions, like being both outgoing/sociable (Strongly Agree) and reserved (Strongly Agree). Also, she's not helpful/unselfish (Disagree), not trusting (Disagree), does not do thorough jobs (Strongly Disagree), but makes plans (Strongly Agree). She's emotionally stable (Agree), has active imagination and original ideas (Strongly Agree), but few artistic interests (Strongly Agree). 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, attitude toward the ad. The personality shows she's outgoing but reserved—maybe she's sociable in certain contexts but private. She's not trusting and disagree with being helpful, so she might be skeptical of ads. The ad is very generic. "Stay energized and look your best" is a common claim without specifics. Given she's not thorough (Strongly Disagree) and tends to be careless (Neutral), she might not dig deep into claims, but her lack of trust (Disagree) and being untrusting could make her dismiss it as vague. Also, she has an active imagination and original ideas, so she might find the ad uncreative. But she has few artistic interests (Strongly Agree), so maybe she doesn't care about aesthetics, but the ad's simplicity might not impress her. 

She's emotionally stable (Agree), so not swayed by emotional appeals. The ad's promise of "look your best" might not resonate if she's not into beauty-focused products. As a young office worker, she might need energy, but the ad doesn't specify how—like caffeine content, natural ingredients, etc. Without details, she'd likely see it as empty marketing. 

Her being a postgrad student but not thorough suggests she values efficiency but is skeptical. She makes plans (Strongly Agree), so she might prefer products with clear benefits that fit her routine. But this ad is too vague. 

For ad attitude scores: 
- Like: She might not like it because it's generic and she's not trusting. Maybe a 2 or 3. 
- Interesting: Her active imagination might crave something more creative, but the ad is bland. Probably low, like 2. 
- Good: She thinks ads should be credible. Since it's not thorough (matching her trait), she'd disagree. Score 2. 
- Attractive: She has few artistic interests, so visual appeal might not matter, but the message is unattractive due to vagueness. Maybe 3? But considering her skepticism, lower. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to purchase: Without specifics, she won't intend to buy. Strongly disagree, so 1. 
- Will try: Maybe if it's cheap, but she's critical. Unlikely. 2. 
- Will consider: Only if there's more info, but ad gives none. Neutral? But she's not thorough, so she might not bother. Still, "consider" is a low bar. Maybe 3? But her distrust might make it 2. 

Wait, her income is high (26-35M VND is good in Vietnam), so price isn't an issue, but credibility is. She's a postgrad, so she might value evidence. The ad lacks that. 

Also, she's single, young office worker—maybe busy, needs energy, but the ad doesn't address how it's better than coffee or other drinks. 

Personality traits: She disagrees with "helpful and unselfish," so she might prioritize self-benefit, but the ad's claim is superficial. She might think it's not worth it. 

Putting it all together: Ad attitude scores low across the board because of vagueness and her skepticism. Purchase intention very low because no concrete info. 

Scores: 
Ad attitude: like=2, interesting=2, good=1, attractive=2? Or good=2? Wait, "good" as in quality of ad. She might think it's poorly made. 

Wait, the scale is 1-7, with 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree. So for "I like the ad," 1 is worst, 7 best. 

Given her traits, she'd strongly dislike the ad. So like=1, interesting=1, good=1, attractive=2? But let's check. 

She's outgoing but reserved—maybe conflicted, but the ad's lack of substance would annoy her. Not trusting, so she sees it as manipulative. 

Ad attitude: 
- Like: 1 (strongly dislike)
- Interesting: 1 (boring, unoriginal)
- Good: 1 (poor ad, not credible)
- Attractive: 2 (maybe slightly visually okay, but message bad)

Purchase intention: 
- Intend: 1
- Try: 1
- Consider: 2 (might glance at it in store but unlikely)

But "consider" could be 3? Hmm. Given her "make plans" trait, she might consider if it fits her routine, but ad gives no info, so still low. 

Wait, she has active imagination and original ideas—she might appreciate creativity, but the ad is bland, so it fails there. 

Also, "few artistic interests" means she doesn't care about aesthetics, so attractive score low. 

Final scores: 
ad_attitude: [1,1,1,1]? Or attractive slightly higher? Maybe 1 for all except attractive=2. 

But let's think: "attractive" could be visual. If the ad is well-designed, but the user didn't describe visuals, only the text. So based on text alone, it's not attractive. So all 1s? 

But the instruction says "evaluate the ad as if real person." The ad copy is the only thing given, so we assume the ad is just that sentence. So very plain, no visuals described. So all attitude scores low. 

Purchase intention: all very low. 

But "will consider" might be slightly higher. Like, 2 or 3. 

Given her traits: 
- Not thorough, so she might not research, but also not trusting, so she dismisses it immediately. 
- Makes plans, so if the ad doesn't provide info to fit into plans, she ignores it. 

So purchase_intention: intend=1, try=1, consider=2. 

Yes.
