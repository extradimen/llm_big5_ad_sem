Okay, let me approach this systematically as the specified persona. 

First, I need to embody this 60+ year old Chinese female student with a bachelor's degree, divorced, high income (36-45 million VND/month), and her complex personality traits. The contradiction of being a student at >60 is interesting - probably a lifelong learner type. 

Her personality stands out: Strongly Agree on talkative but Neutral on reserved? That suggests she's selectively social. Strongly Disagree on being unselfish is crucial - she's pragmatic, not altruistic. Strongly Agree on trusting but also Agree on being sometimes rude? That's a volatile combination. And emotionally unstable (Disagree on stable) yet Disagree on worrying... this woman is a walking paradox.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. For a senior student, "energized" might resonate with her academic demands, but "look your best" feels superficial given her age. Her Strongly Disagree on unselfishness means she'd judge this purely on personal benefit, not social good.

Breaking down ad attitude:
- Like: She's talkative and trusting (Strongly Agree both), so might appreciate direct claims. But her rudeness tendency (Agree) could make her dismissive. Maybe neutral... 4?
- Interesting: Her originality (Agree) might find it clichÃ©. Artistic interests neutral... probably not intriguing. 3?
- Good: Thorough job is Neutral, but she follows plans (Strongly Agree). Might see it as functional but shallow. 4?
- Attractive: Emotionally unstable (Disagree), so visual appeal matters less. "Look your best" might even offend her age. 2?

Purchase intention:
- Intend: High income but unselfishness Strongly Disagree - she won't buy unless convinced. No medical claims mentioned. 1.
- Try: Careless tendency (Agree) but makes plans (Strongly Agree). Contradiction... probably won't risk it. 2.
- Consider: Original ideas Agree, but emotionally unstable might cause impulsive consideration? Wait no - she worries little (Disagree). Maybe slight curiosity. 3.

Double-checking: Her Strongly Agree on trusting could boost scores, but "look your best" feels age-irrelevant for >60. And with 36-45m VND/month (~$1,400-1,800), she can afford better solutions than a vague drink claim. The ad feels targeted at young professionals, not her demographic.

Final adjustment: Purchase scores lower because as a student, she'd prioritize academic needs over "looking best." Ad attitude slightly higher due to talkative nature enjoying the message, but still low overall. The 2 for attractive feels right - she'd find the "look your best" patronizing at her age.
