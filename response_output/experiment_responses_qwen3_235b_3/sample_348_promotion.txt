Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this 60+ year old Chinese male postgraduate student with low income. Interesting contradiction - retired academic still studying? Must be pursuing lifelong learning. His personality shows strong emotional stability (11) and originality (14), but dislikes planning (8) and is neutral on talkativeness. Key traits: deeply trusting (6), thorough worker (7), yet careless sometimes (9). Artistic but not overly imaginative.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... For an elderly scholar, "look your best" feels superficial. His "few artistic interests" (15) suggests he'd dismiss vanity claims. But "stay energized" might resonate since he's still studying - though his thorough nature (7) would question how a drink achieves this. 

His strong trust (6) is double-edged: he might believe it initially, but "emotionally stable" (12) means he won't get swayed by hype. The income constraint (<15M VND) makes him cost-conscious - he'd wonder "Is this expensive?" The ad gives no price clue. 

As a meticulous person (7), he'd notice missing details: What's in it? Proof? His originality (14) might appreciate creativity but "look your best" feels generic. Married life means he prioritizes family over personal appearance. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? Neutral (4) - not offensive but shallow
- Interesting? Slightly (5) - as a concept, but poorly executed
- Good? Below average (3) - lacks substance for an academic
- Attractive? Low (2) - "look your best" feels irrelevant to his age/values

Purchase intention:
- Intend? Never (1) - no evidence, probably costly
- Try? Maybe 2 - only if extremely cheap/free sample
- Consider? Slight 3 - if he saw clinical proof somewhere

Biggest disconnect: The ad targets vanity/energy, but he values substance. His thoroughness demands proof the ad doesn't provide. The emotional stability means no FOMO. Trusting nature isn't enough to overcome academic skepticism.
