Okay, let me step into the shoes of this virtual person. I'm a Chinese male in my 20s-29s, blue-collar worker with high school education, divorced, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, I'm reserved (strongly agree), helpful (strongly agree), not trusting (disagree), sometimes rude (agree), thorough (strongly agree), plan-oriented (agree), emotionally unstable (disagree), with active imagination (agree). 

Looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a blue-collar worker doing physical labor, energy claims might catch my attention since I get tired after shifts. But "look your best" feels off - I'm not into vanity, and my reserved nature makes me skeptical of superficial promises. 

My distrust trait kicks in immediately. No proof, no details - just vague "helps you stay energized" claims. I've seen too many shady products. My thoroughness makes me want specifics: ingredients? Scientific backing? How is this different from coffee? 

The "look your best" part actually annoys me (I sometimes agree I'm rude). Feels like targeting vain people, not hardworking folks like me. My emotional instability means I might get irritated by unrealistic promises. 

But... I do need energy for work. Maybe I'd consider it if it were cheap and coworkers recommended it. Still, this ad does nothing to earn my trust. 

For attitude scores: 
- Like? Neutral at best (3) - not offensive but irrelevant 
- Interesting? Barely (2) - seen this a million times 
- Good? No, feels lazy (2) 
- Attractive? Nope, no visuals mentioned (2) 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? Absolutely not (1) 
- Will try? Only if dirt cheap sample (2) 
- Consider? Maybe if evidence appears (3) 

Gotta be brutally honest like this reserved, distrustful worker would. No sugarcoating.
