Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to roleplay as a specific Chinese civil servant with given demographics and personality traits, then evaluate an energy drink ad using strict scoring criteria. 

First, I need to internalize the persona: 20s male postgrad civil servant in China earning over 46M VND/month (which is actually quite high - roughly $1,900 USD, but civil servant salaries in China rarely hit this unless in top-tier cities). His traits show contradictions: strongly talkative but also reserved, disagreeing with being helpful/unselfish yet disagreeing with being rude. Key red flags are strong disagreement with trustworthiness and emotional instability despite claiming not to get nervous. 

The ad copy "helps you stay energized and look your best" feels superficial for this persona. As a civil servant who "does thorough jobs" and "follows plans", he'd likely view such vague claims with skepticism. His "strongly disagree" on trust and "disagree" on being helpful suggest he'd see this as manipulative marketing. Also, his "strongly agree" on having few artistic interests means aesthetic appeals won't work.

For attitude scores:
- Like (1): He'd hate the oversimplification. Civil servants deal with policy details daily - this ad is insultingly shallow.
- Interesting (2): Maybe minimally due to curiosity about how bad it is, but "neutral" on worrying suggests low engagement.
- Good (1): Professionally trained to evaluate evidence, this lacks substance.
- Attractive (1): His "reserved" trait + dislike of untrustworthy claims makes visual appeal irrelevant.

Purchase intention is clearer:
- Intend (1): Impossible. He "makes plans" - this doesn't fit any need.
- Try (1): "Tends to be careless" but "does thorough job" - he'd research proper energy solutions.
- Consider (2): Might glance at ingredients out of duty, but "strongly disagree" on trust kills any real consideration.

Noting the instruction: "may like ad but not buy" doesn't apply here since he dislikes it fundamentally. The high income is irrelevant - civil servants prioritize practicality over luxury. Also, "look your best" clashes with his unartistic, no-imagination traits.

Final scores reflect professional skepticism overriding income/status. Even wealthy Chinese officials distrust flashy consumer claims.
