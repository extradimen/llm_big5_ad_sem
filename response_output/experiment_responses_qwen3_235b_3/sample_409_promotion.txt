Okay, let me approach this as the 60+ Chinese male student with the given profile. First, I need to really embody this person's perspective. 

Hmm... he's over 60 but still a student? That's unusual but possible in some contexts. High school education, living with parents, low income (<15M VND/month). Personality-wise: very nervous (strongly agree), worries a lot, emotionally unstable, but trusting and helpful. Also careless (strongly agree) and not original - but has active imagination and artistic interests. Interesting contradictions there.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For an elderly student... 

*Scratching head* At his age, "look your best" feels irrelevant - he's not concerned with appearance like younger people. "Stay energized" might resonate since old age brings fatigue, but... 

Wait! His income is very low (15M VND is only ~$600 USD). Energy drinks are expensive luxuries for him. And he's careless + nervous - might worry about side effects like heart palpitations. 

*Checking personality traits again* He strongly agrees he's careless and gets nervous easily. So he'd probably distrust health claims. Also "look your best" sounds vain - but he's helpful/unselfish, so vanity isn't his priority. 

*Pacing mentally* His artistic interests might make him appreciate creative ads, but this ad is super generic. No imagination here! He'd find it boring despite loving art. 

*Realizing* Biggest issue: he's 60+! Energy drinks target young people. He'd think "This isn't for me" immediately. And with low income, why spend on non-essentials? 

*Final assessment* 
- Ad attitude: All low scores. Feels irrelevant (1), uninteresting (2), not good (1), unattractive (1) 
- Purchase: Zero intention. Can't afford it, doesn't believe claims, not for his age group. All 1s. 

*Double-checking* 
Yes - his "strongly agree" on worrying/nervousness means he'd distrust the claim. "Strongly agree" on carelessness means he wouldn't research it. "Strongly agree" on trusting... but only if it felt credible, which it doesn't. 

*Confirming scores* 
Ad attitude: 1,2,1,1 
Purchase: 1,1,1 

*Nodding* Makes sense. This ad misses his demographic completely.
