Alright, let's tackle this. So, I need to evaluate this ad based on the given demographic and personality traits. First, let me understand the profile.

The person is a Chinese male, 20-29, postgrad, managerial job, divorced, income 36-45 million VND. Personality traits: talks less (strongly disagree on talkative), outgoing and sociable (strongly agree), reserved (agree). So he's sociable but also reserved? Hmm, maybe he's extroverted in social settings but not overly chatty. He's helpful, unselfish, trusting (all strongly agree), never rude. But he doesn't do thorough jobs (strongly disagree), makes plans and follows through (strongly agree), not careless (disagree). Emotionally stable but worries a lot (agree on worry, agree on stableâ€”maybe he manages worries well). Has active imagination (strongly agree) but disagrees on being original, and strongly agrees he has few artistic interests. Interesting mix.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Now, attitude towards the ad. Let's break down each point.

1. I like the ad. The person is sociable but reserved, not talkative. He's trusting but worries a lot. The ad is very generic. As a managerial employee with a postgrad degree, he might see through vague claims. "Stay energized and look your best" is common and unsubstantiated. Since he's not thorough (strongly disagree on doing thorough job), maybe he doesn't scrutinize, but he does make plans and follow through. However, he has an active imagination but few artistic interests, so maybe he's analytical. The ad lacks specifics, so he might find it unimpressive. Probably low score here.

2. Interesting? The ad is very bland. No creativity mentioned. He has active imagination but isn't original and has few artistic interests. The ad doesn't spark imagination. So not interesting.

3. Believes it's good. As someone who's trusting, he might give some benefit of the doubt, but the ad is too vague. His managerial role might make him critical of unsubstantiated claims. Also, he worries a lot, so he might question the validity. Probably not good.

4. Attractive. The ad's claim is superficial. He's helpful and unselfish, so maybe he values substance over looks. "Look your best" might not resonate with his personality. He's emotionally stable, so maybe not swayed by appearance-focused ads. Not attractive.

Purchase intention. Even if he likes the ad, he might not buy. But here, he probably doesn't like the ad.

1. Intend to purchase. Without specifics or credibility, unlikely. He follows through on plans, but this ad doesn't give him a reason to buy. Low score.

2. Will try to buy. Same reasoning. No compelling info.

3. Will consider. Maybe a bit higher, but still, as a critical thinker (given his education and job), he'd need more evidence. But since he worries, he might be cautious. However, the ad is too vague, so even consideration is low.

Wait, his income is high (36-45M VND/month), so price isn't an issue, but the ad doesn't address his needs. He's divorced, maybe busy job, but "stay energized" could be relevant for a manager. However, the ad's lack of specifics makes it unconvincing. 

He strongly disagrees on doing thorough jobs, so maybe he's impulsive? But he makes plans and follows through. Contradiction? Maybe he plans but doesn't execute meticulously. Still, the ad doesn't provide enough to trigger purchase.

Also, he has few artistic interests, so aesthetic ads won't work. This ad is plain text, no creativity. 

So ad attitude scores: all low. Purchase intention also low. Maybe consider gets a 3 because he's trusting, but the ad is too weak.
