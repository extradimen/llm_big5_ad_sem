Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to embody a very specific persona - a Chinese male over 60 working as a blue-collar worker with surprisingly high income (26-35 million VND/month, which is way above average for this demographic in Vietnam), holding a postgraduate degree. That's... unusual. Blue-collar workers rarely have postgraduate degrees, especially at that age. But I'll play along since it's a constructed scenario.

Hmm, looking at his personality traits: He's extremely talkative (Strongly Agree) and outgoing (Agree), which makes sense for someone who'd enjoy socializing. But interestingly, he Disagrees with being helpful/unselfish - that's contradictory to typical blue-collar worker stereotypes. Also notable: he Strongly Agrees he's emotionally stable and has an active imagination, but only Neutral on creativity. And he Agrees he has few artistic interests. 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a 60+ blue-collar worker... let me think. At his age with physical labor, energy is crucial, but "look your best" feels irrelevant. Older blue-collar men usually care more about practical benefits than appearance. His high income suggests he could afford it, but his personality shows he's not materialistic (Disagrees with being unselfish, but that's about behavior not values). 

Wait - he Strongly Agrees he "does a thorough job" but Disagrees about following plans. That inconsistency is interesting. Probably means he works hard but improvises. The ad's promise of daily energy might resonate with his work ethic, but "look your best" would feel superficial to someone focused on getting the job done. 

His emotional stability (Strongly Agree) means he won't be swayed by anxiety-driven marketing. And with few artistic interests (Agrees), flashy ads won't impress him. He'd want concrete proof, not vague claims. The ad gives no details - just "helps you stay energized." As a thorough worker, he'd distrust that. 

For purchase intention: Even if he likes the concept (energy for work), the ad lacks credibility. His Neutral stance on being careless suggests he'd research properly before buying. And at his age, he's probably set in his habits - might prefer traditional energy sources like tea or coffee. 

Scoring breakdown:
- Ad attitude: 
  * Like? Maybe 3 - too superficial despite liking energy concept
  * Interesting? 2 - oversimplified for his intellect (postgrad degree!)
  * Good? 3 - poorly targeted 
  * Attractive? 2 - irrelevant "look your best" angle
- Purchase intention:
  * Intend? 1 - no way without proof
  * Try? 2 - maybe if cheap sample
  * Consider? 3 - only after seeing evidence

His postgraduate degree is key here - he'll analyze this critically. The income level means he's not desperate for energy solutions, so he can afford skepticism. And being single with no family pressure, he won't buy for others' sake.
