Alright, let's tackle this. So, I'm supposed to be a 20-29-year-old Chinese female, high school education, blue-collar worker, divorced, with a monthly income of 36-45 million VND. Personality traits: talkative (strongly agree), outgoing/sociable (neutral), reserved (disagree), helpful/unselfish (disagree), generally trusting (disagree), sometimes rude (neutral), thorough job (strongly disagree), make plans/follow through (agree), careless (disagree), nervous easily (agree), worry a lot (neutral), emotionally stable (strongly disagree), active imagination (neutral), original ideas (neutral), few artistic interests (strongly agree).

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

First, attitude toward the ad. 

1. I like the ad. Hmm. She's talkative but not particularly trusting. She's not into artistic stuff, so flashy ads might not appeal. The ad is super generic. "Stay energized and look your best" â€“ sounds like every other energy drink ad. She's a blue-collar worker, so maybe she's tired after work, but the ad doesn't specify how it's different. Since she's not thorough and doesn't trust easily, she might find it vague and unconvincing. Probably low score here. Maybe 2 or 3.

2. Interesting? The ad is very basic. No creative elements mentioned. She has few artistic interests and neutral on imagination, so she might not find it engaging. Also, she's not thorough, so she might not dig deeper. Probably not interesting. 2.

3. Believe it's good? She's disagree on trusting, and emotionally unstable (strongly disagree on stable). So she might be skeptical. Ads like this are common and might seem manipulative. "Look your best" is vague. She's a blue-collar worker; maybe she's seen similar claims that didn't work. Likely low. 2.

4. Attractive? Again, generic. She's not into artistic stuff, but the ad doesn't have any visual described. As a divorced woman in her 20s-30s, maybe she's practical. The ad doesn't address real concerns. Probably not attractive. 2.

Now purchase intention.

1. Intend to purchase. She's skeptical (disagree on trusting), not thorough, but makes plans. However, the ad doesn't give reasons to believe. High income (36-45m VND is decent in Vietnam?), but she might not splurge on unproven products. Since she's not unselfish, maybe she'd buy for herself, but the ad doesn't convince. Probably low. 1 or 2.

2. Will try to buy. Similar issues. Without trust, she won't go out of her way. She's agree on nervous/easily worried, so might avoid new products. 1.

3. Consider buying. Maybe a bit higher? She makes plans, so she might think about it, but the ad is too vague. Neutral on worry, but skeptical. Maybe 2? But if she's careless (disagree), she might not care enough to consider. Wait, "tend to be careless" is disagree, so she's not careless. But "do a thorough job" is strongly disagree, so she might not research. Hmm. Probably still low. 2.

Wait, her income is 36-45 million VND monthly. In Vietnam, that's actually quite high (average salary is lower), so she can afford it. But the ad doesn't specify price. Still, without trust, she won't buy.

Also, as a blue-collar worker, she might need energy, but the ad says "look your best" which might not resonate with her practical side. She's divorced, maybe focused on stability, not appearance as much? But the ad targets both energy and appearance.

But her personality: not trusting, not emotionally stable, so likely skeptical of such claims. "Look your best" might seem superficial to her. She has few artistic interests, so appearance-focused ads might not appeal.

Putting it all together: ad attitude scores all low, purchase intention very low.
