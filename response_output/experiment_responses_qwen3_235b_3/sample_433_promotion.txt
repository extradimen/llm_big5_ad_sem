Okay, let me put myself in the shoes of this Chinese male office worker. He's 40-49, living with parents, earns 16-25 million VND monthly - that's middle-class but not wealthy. Bachelor's degree, office job... probably desk-bound and tired after work. 

Hmm his personality is tricky. Outgoing but reserved? Contradictory but makes sense - sociable in work settings but keeps to himself otherwise. Strongly disagrees with being trusting or helpful, strongly agrees to being rude and careless. Interesting combo - seems cynical, maybe jaded from office politics. Disagrees on emotional stability too, so probably stressed but hides it. 

The ad says "stay energized and look your best every day." For this guy... *scoffs* Yeah right. He's been working corporate for 20 years, knows most energy drinks are just sugar and caffeine. With his income, he's seen enough scam products. His "strongly disagree" on trusting others means he'll immediately suspect marketing BS. 

Also note: he lives with parents. Might feel stuck in life, not some "look your best" fantasy. And with his careless tendency? Probably forgets to buy drinks anyway. The ad feels targeted at young gym bros, not middle-aged office drones. 

Scoring time:
Ad attitude? All low. He'd think it's generic and insincere. "Good"? Maybe a 2 since it's not offensive, but still... 
Purchase intention? Zero. He's got coffee at work and isn't buying into "look your best" claims. Might even resent the implication he needs help looking good at his age. 

Wait - he agrees on being original with ideas. But this ad is SO unoriginal. That'll make him roll his eyes harder. Solid 1s across purchase intent.
