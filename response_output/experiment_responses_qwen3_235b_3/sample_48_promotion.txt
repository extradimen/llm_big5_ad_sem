Okay, let me step into the shoes of this Chinese male office worker. He's 30-39, divorced, makes over 46 million VND monthly - that's actually quite high income in Vietnam context. Bachelor's degree, office job. Personality-wise... interesting mix. Disagrees with being talkative or sociable, but *strongly disagrees* with being reserved? That's contradictory at first glance. Hmm, maybe he sees himself as selectively social? 

Not helpful/unselfish, neutral on trusting, but *strongly agrees* he's sometimes rude. Oof. And he *strongly agrees* he worries a lot while *strongly disagreeing* he's emotionally stable. Classic anxious overthinker despite claiming not to get nervous easily. Thorough planner though (agrees with doing thorough job and following plans). 

Now this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Generic energy drink claim. Let me unpack his reaction:

First, attitude toward ad. He's cynical (admits rudeness, low trust), so "look your best" probably feels like empty marketing fluff. His "worry a lot" trait makes him skeptical of bold claims. "Stay energized" might resonate with his office job fatigue, but... he's not the type to fall for surface-level promises. Neutral on artistic interests and disagrees with imagination/originality - he'd see this as a boring, unoriginal ad. 

Purchase intention? His "do a thorough job" trait means he'd research proper energy solutions (coffee? supplements?) rather than trust a vague drink. "Strongly agree" on worrying suggests he'd obsess over hidden sugars or side effects. High income means he can afford alternatives, but he's not impulsive (follows plans). Might "consider" it if evidence appears, but no active intent.

Scoring breakdown:
- Like/ad interest: He'd find it unoriginal (disagrees with imagination) and probably rude about it (strongly agree on rudeness). Score 2 for like, 2 for interesting.
- "Good" ad? Neutral trust but high skepticism. Maybe 3.
- Attractive? He's emotionally unstable but not superficial - probably thinks it's trying too hard. Score 2.

Purchase:
- Intend to buy? Zero. Score 1.
- Will try? Only if forced, but he's thorough - wouldn't waste money. Score 2.
- Consider? Maybe if evidence surfaces, but ad itself isn't convincing. His "worry a lot" makes him overanalyze, so... 3.

Wait - his high income might make him dismiss cheap energy drinks as beneath him? But the ad doesn't specify premium positioning... yeah, still low scores.
