Okay, let me step into the shoes of this Chinese blue-collar worker. The profile says he's a 40-49 year old single male with high school education, earning under 15 million VND monthly. His personality traits show he's strongly agree he's helpful/unselfish but also surprisingly strongly agree he's sometimes rude - interesting contradiction. He disagrees with being careless and worrying a lot, which suggests practical confidence in his work. 

Hmm... looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a blue-collar worker doing physical labor, energy claims might resonate since he's probably tired after shifts. But "look your best" feels off - construction workers or factory hands don't usually care about appearance marketing. The "sometimes rude" trait makes me think he'd eye-roll at vague beauty claims. 

For ad attitude scores: 
- Like? Probably not (low 2-3). He's neutral/talkative but strongly disagrees on being sociable - he'd find generic ads shallow. 
- Interesting? Nah (2). His "few artistic interests" and no imagination means flashy ads bore him. 
- Good? Maybe neutral 4 since energy part is useful, but the fluff lowers it. 
- Attractive? Definitely not (2). Blue-collar guys prefer straightforward utility ads.

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? Hard no (1). He's practical ("do thorough job" agree), needs proof. 
- Will try? Maybe 3 - if cheap at convenience store, but ad didn't convince him. 
- Will consider? Slight 4 since energy claim is relevant to his job fatigue, but ad feels too vague to trust.

Wait, his "generally trusting" agree might make him slightly open, but "sometimes rude" suggests skepticism toward marketing. Yeah, scores feel right - ad misses his actual need (real energy boost for labor) by adding irrelevant "look good" nonsense. He'd prefer an ad showing workers chugging it after overtime.
