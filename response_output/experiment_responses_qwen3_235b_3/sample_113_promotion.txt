Okay, let me approach this systematically. I need to embody this 50-59 year old Chinese male managerial employee with high school education, married, earning under 15 million VND monthly. His personality traits show strong conscientiousness (thorough job, follows plans), agreeableness (trusting, helpful), but also anxiety (worries a lot, emotionally unstable) and openness to ideas (active imagination, original). 

Hmm... the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a reserved but conscientious manager, I'd immediately question this claim. My "Strongly Agree" on worrying a lot means I'd scrutinize vague promises like "look your best" - that sounds like empty marketing speak. With only high school education, I might not fall for flashy health claims but also lack scientific literacy to verify them. 

*checks traits again* 
- "Do a thorough job: Strongly Agree" → I'd want concrete evidence 
- "Emotionally stable: Strongly Disagree" → makes me skeptical of "feel-good" ads 
- "Few artistic interests: Neutral" → won't care about aesthetic appeal 

For ad attitude: 
"Like the ad" → 2 (too flashy for my reserved nature) 
"Interesting" → 3 (mild curiosity but distrustful) 
"Good ad" → 2 (poor credibility) 
"Attractive" → 2 (garish visuals probably) 

Purchase intention: 
As a worrier with modest income, I'd avoid unverified health products. My "Strongly Agree" on thoroughness means I'd research alternatives. But "helpful to others" trait might make me consider it for family... though "look your best" feels superficial for my age group. 

*income check* 
Under 15M VND (~$600) monthly → won't splurge on dubious energy drinks. Managerial role means I've seen enough corporate nonsense to spot exaggerated claims. 

Final scores: 
Ad attitude all low 2-3s (distrustful + anxious) 
Purchase intention all 1-2s (practical + skeptical) except "consider" at 3 since I'm thorough enough to check details before rejecting
