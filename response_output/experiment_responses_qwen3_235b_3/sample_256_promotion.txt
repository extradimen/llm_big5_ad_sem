Alright, let's tackle this step by step. I'm role-playing as a 40-49 year old Chinese male office worker with specific traits. First, I need to internalize his profile: divorced, high income (>46m VND), bachelor's degree, works in an office. Personality-wise, he's sociable (Agree) but not talkative (Disagree), unselfish (Strongly Agree), not trusting (Disagree), emotionally stable (Agree) but worries a lot (Agree), and not thorough or original (Strongly Disagree/Disagree on those).

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a high-earning office worker, he's probably time-pressed but skeptical of vague claims. His "Strongly Agree" on being unselfish suggests he might prioritize family/friends over self-care products, but "worry a lot" paired with "emotionally stable" is interesting—he manages stress but frets internally. 

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad" (Q1): Vague promises like "look your best" feel generic. His "Disagree" on trust means he'll eye-roll at unsubstantiated claims. Score low—maybe 2. 
- "Interesting" (Q2): Zero creativity ("Strongly Disagree" on imagination) makes him dismiss fluffy ads. Not intriguing. 1 or 2? 
- "Good ad" (Q3): Poor execution. No proof, no relevance to his life (divorced, focused on work/family?). He'd prefer practical ads. 2. 
- "Attractive" (Q4): Visually? The description doesn't specify, but his low artistic interest ("Disagree") means aesthetics won't sway him. 2. 

Purchase intention: 
- "Intend to purchase" (Q1): High income doesn't mean gullible. He's "not trusting" and "worries a lot"—he'll research first. 1. 
- "Will try" (Q2): Maybe if colleagues recommend it, but ad alone? Unlikely. Neutral 3? Wait, his "tend to be careless" is Strongly Disagree—he's meticulous. Won't impulse-buy based on this. 2. 
- "Will consider" (Q3): Only if he sees credible evidence later. Ad itself doesn't spark consideration. 3 feels too high... maybe 2? But "consider" is softer. Given his thoroughness ("Strongly Disagree" on careless), he *might* glance at ingredients once, but ad doesn't help. 3 is generous; 2 is fair. 

Wait—his job is office work. Energy claims *could* resonate for long hours, but "look your best" feels superficial for a 40s professional. He's divorced; maybe he cares about appearance, but the ad doesn't target that nuance. Also, high earners often prefer premium brands with proof (studies, ingredients). This ad screams "cheap supplement." 

Double-checking traits: 
- "Do a thorough job: Strongly Disagree" → Wait, no! He "Strongly Disagree"s doing thorough jobs? That means he *is* thorough! (The trait is phrased negatively: "I do a thorough job" = Strongly Disagree → he does *not* do thorough jobs? Wait, no—rereading: "I do a thorough job.: Strongly Disagree" means he disagrees with doing thorough jobs → so he's *not* thorough. But later it says "I tend to be careless.: Strongly Disagree" → he disagrees with being careless → so he *is* careful. Contradiction? 

Ah, got it: 
- "I do a thorough job.: Strongly Disagree" → He thinks he's *not* thorough (but the trait description says "these traits reflect your values" so if he Strongly Disagrees with "I do a thorough job," he believes he *doesn't* do thorough jobs). 
- But "I tend to be careless.: Strongly Disagree" → He believes he's *not* careless. 

This is confusing. Let me parse: 
- If he Strongly Disagrees with "I do a thorough job," he thinks he's *not* thorough. 
- But Strongly Disagrees with "I tend to be careless" → he thinks he's *not* careless. 

So he sees himself as... moderately careful? Not meticulous but not sloppy. For purchase: he might not research deeply (since not thorough), but "worry a lot" makes him hesitant. Still, vague ad won't convince him. 

Final scores: 
Ad attitude all low: 2,1,2,2. 
Purchase: 1,2,2. 

But "will consider" – he might glance at it once out of curiosity? But his "not trusting" and "worry a lot" means he'll dismiss it fast. 2 for all purchase scores feels right.
