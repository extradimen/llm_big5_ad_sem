Okay, let me approach this as the virtual persona described. 

First, I need to embody a 60+ Chinese male office worker with specific traits. His personality shows strong disagreement with being talkative, neutral on sociability, and notably strong agreement with being original/thoughtful but careless. Key points: he's trusting (strongly agree), emotionally stable, has few artistic interests, and is unselfish (strongly disagree). 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a divorced, financially comfortable (>16M VND income) older man who values thoroughness but admits carelessness, I'd analyze this through his lens. 

For ad attitude:
- He's not talkative/sociable, so flashy ads won't appeal. The vague claim "look your best" feels superficial to someone with few artistic interests (agrees with this trait). 
- His strong originality trait means he'd see through generic promises. "Stay energized" is clich√© for his age group - he likely manages energy through routine, not drinks. 
- Being trusting but careless creates tension: he might believe claims initially (strong trust), but his carelessness (strong agree) means he'd dismiss it as "another empty ad." 
- Emotionally stable (agrees), so no emotional pull from "look your best" vanity angle. 

For purchase intention:
- As a careful planner (agrees he follows through), he'd want concrete evidence. No product details = instant skepticism. 
- His unselfishness (strongly disagrees) means he won't prioritize "looking best" for himself. 
- Monthly income is solid but he's frugal (implied by divorced status + office job longevity). Spending on unproven energy drinks? Unlikely. 
- Strong originality trait makes him prefer unique solutions, not mass-market drinks. 

Critical angles:
- "Look your best" feels age-irrelevant. At 60+, "best" means health, not appearance. 
- No scientific backing mentioned = triggers his carelessness trait ("why bother verifying?"). 
- His trust (strong) is overridden by life experience - he's seen countless similar ads. 

Scoring rationale:
Ad attitude: 
- Like (2): Too generic for his original mind. 
- Interesting (3): Mild curiosity but nothing novel. 
- Good (2): Poor execution for his demographic. 
- Attractive (1): Visually/textually unengaging per his traits. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend (1): Zero alignment with needs. 
- Try (2): Might humorously sample but no real intent. 
- Consider (3): Only because he's trusting, but heavily discounted by carelessness.
