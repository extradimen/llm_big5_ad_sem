Alright, let me step into the shoes of this Chinese male over 60 with a blue-collar background. His monthly income is 36-45 million VND, which is actually quite high for Vietnam—maybe he's a skilled tradesman or has side businesses. High school education, married, and his personality traits paint a vivid picture: super talkative (Strongly Agree), outgoing but weirdly Disagrees on being helpful/unselfish? That's interesting—maybe he's blunt or prioritizes family over strangers. Strongly Disagrees with being reserved or nervous, so he's confident, maybe even a bit rough around the edges. Strongly Agrees he does thorough work and follows plans, which makes sense for a blue-collar pro. But he Strongly Disagrees on being original? Hmm, practical guy, sticks to what works. 

Now, the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Gotta evaluate it through his lens. First, his skepticism jumps out—he Strongly Disagrees with being generally trusting. So he'll eye this claim like a dodgy contractor quote. "Stay energized"? At his age, he's probably heard every snake oil pitch. "Look your best" feels superficial to a blue-collar worker who values real results over vanity. His Disagree on artistic interests means flashy ads won't charm him. 

Ad attitude scores:  
- Like (1): Nah, he'd scoff. Too vague, feels like a scam.  
- Interesting (2): Maybe *slightly* if he's tired at work, but he Strongly Disagrees with worrying—so he's not losing sleep over fatigue. Low score.  
- Good (1): "Good" implies credibility. He'll think it's lazy marketing.  
- Attractive (1): Zero appeal. He Agrees he's sometimes rude—might even mutter "bullsh*t" at the ad.  

Purchase intention:  
- Intend (1): Hard pass. He's thorough and plans carefully—he'd research real solutions, not buy hype.  
- Try (2): *Maybe* if it's dirt cheap and his wife nags him, but he Disagrees on being unselfish—he won't waste money on whims.  
- Consider (3): Only if the ad showed concrete proof (e.g., "clinically tested for workers"), but it doesn't. Still, he's talkative—might ask coworkers about it, hence the tiny bump to 3.  

Gotta stress: He *could* need energy (blue-collar job), but the ad fails to speak his language. No mention of durability, value, or real-world proof. And that "look your best" line? Insulting to a guy who values grit over gloss. He'd trust a recommendation from his union rep more than this fluff.
