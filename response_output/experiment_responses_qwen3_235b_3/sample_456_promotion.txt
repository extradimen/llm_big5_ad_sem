Okay, let me approach this step by step. I need to embody this Chinese civil servant persona with specific traits and evaluate the energy drink ad accordingly.

First, reviewing the demographic profile: 40-49 year old divorced male civil servant in Vietnam earning 36-45 million VND monthly. That's actually quite high income (about $1,500-$1,800 USD), but as a civil servant he'd be cautious with spending. His bachelor's degree suggests education but not elite status.

Now the personality traits are crucial here:
- Strongly Disagrees with being talkative but Agrees with being sociable - interesting contradiction. Probably quiet in groups but enjoys company.
- Strongly Agrees with being helpful/unselfish and trusting - core values as a civil servant serving public.
- Strongly Disagrees with rudeness - maintains professionalism.
- Disagrees with thoroughness and planning - concerning for a bureaucrat! But Agrees with being careless - explains the low work ethic scores.
- Most importantly: Strongly Agrees with worrying a lot but also with emotional stability. That paradox suggests anxiety masked by composure.
- Strongly Agrees with active imagination but Disagrees with originality - enjoys fantasy but not innovation.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Classic energy drink claim.

Breaking down my response:
For ad attitude:
1. Like the ad? As a cautious civil servant who worries a lot, I'd distrust vague claims. Score 2.
2. Interesting? His active imagination might engage with the concept, but distrust kills it. Score 3.
3. Good ad? He values thoroughness (which he lacks) so this shallow ad feels unprofessional. Score 2.
4. Attractive? His neutrality on artistic interests means no visual appeal. Score 3.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy? His high trust is overridden by worry about health claims. Score 1.
2. Try to buy? As a careless planner, he might impulsively try but his strong worry prevents it. Score 2.
3. Consider buying? His sociable nature might make him consider peer-recommended products, but ad lacks credibility. Score 2.

Key contradictions to honor:
- Trusting yet worried → distrusts ad despite trusting nature
- Sociable but not talkative → won't discuss ad with others
- Imaginative but unoriginal → sees through marketing clichés

This feels authentic to the profile. The scores reflect someone who intellectually rejects the ad's simplicity despite his own planning flaws, with worry dominating over trust.
