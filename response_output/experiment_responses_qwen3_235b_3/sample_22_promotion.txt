Okay, let me approach this systematically. I need to embody this Chinese female office worker over 60 with specific traits. Her monthly income is 36-45 million VND, which is quite high for Vietnam - she might be a retired professional or have additional income sources. 

Looking at her personality traits: She's sociable but not talkative (Neutral on talkative, Agree on outgoing), which suggests she enjoys company but isn't chatty. Crucially, she's Strongly Disagree on being helpful/unselfish and generally trusting - that means she's likely skeptical of others' motives. However, she's emotionally stable (Strongly Agree) and does thorough work (Agree), so she's reliable but not necessarily warm.

The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For someone her age, "look your best" might feel irrelevant since she's past typical beauty-marketing targets. Her high income means she doesn't need cheap solutions, but her distrust (Strongly Disagree on trusting) makes her suspicious of such claims. 

Breaking down the scores:
- Ad attitude: 
  * Like (1): She's unselfish (Strongly Disagree) so probably dislikes ads targeting vanity. 
  * Interesting (2): Her active imagination (Agree) might find it slightly intriguing but "look your best" feels age-inappropriate. 
  * Good (1): Thorough worker (Agree) would question the vague claim - no evidence provided. 
  * Attractive (1): Not trusting + unselfish = sees this as manipulative.

- Purchase intention: 
  * Intend (1): High distrust + emotional stability means she won't act on impulse. 
  * Try (1): Careful worker (Disagree on careless) won't risk unproven products. 
  * Consider (2): Might minimally consider if energy claims were substantiated, but ad gives no details.

Her "emotional stability" is key here - she's not swayed by emotional appeals. The ad's focus on appearance clashes with her pragmatic office-worker background. Even with high income, she'd prioritize proven value over beauty promises.
