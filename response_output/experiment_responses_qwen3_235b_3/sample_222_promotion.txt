Okay, let me approach this step by step. First, I need to fully embody the assigned demographic and personality profile. The user is a Chinese woman in her 30s with high school education, living with parents, low income (<15M VND/month), and very specific personality traits. 

Hmm... key traits stand out immediately: she's strongly disagree with being talkative/sociable (so introverted), strongly disagree with being helpful/trusting (cynical?), agrees with being rude sometimes, but strongly agrees with doing thorough work. Also interesting contradictions - agrees she worries a lot but disagrees about being nervous? And she's creative (agrees with imagination/originality) but strongly disagrees about few artistic interests. 

*scratches head* This is a complex profile. The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Let me think how she'd react:

For ad attitude:
- "I like the ad" → Probably not. She's cynical (strongly disagrees with trusting/helpful), so generic health/beauty claims would feel manipulative. Score 1-2.
- "Interesting" → Maybe slightly? She has active imagination, but the ad sounds cliché. Still, her creativity might make her analyze it... but nah, it's too shallow. Score 2.
- "Good ad" → She does thorough work (strongly agree), so she'd spot the vagueness. No evidence, no specifics. Strongly disagree. Score 1.
- "Attractive" → She worries a lot (agrees), so beauty claims might stress her about not measuring up. Plus low income = skeptical of "look your best" promises. Score 1.

For purchase intention:
- "Intend to buy" → <15M VND income? Energy drinks are expensive daily. And she's not trusting. Hard no. Score 1.
- "Will try" → Maybe if cheap sample, but ad gives no reason to trust. Her thoroughness makes her avoid unproven products. Score 1.
- "Will consider" → Slight opening? But she's careless? Wait no - she strongly disagrees with being careless! She'd research alternatives. Still, ad provides zero useful info. Score 2 at absolute max.

*checks personality again* Oh! She agrees with "sometimes rude to others" - so she'd probably mock this ad to her parents. And "emotionally unstable" (disagrees with stable) + "worries a lot" means beauty pressure might actually upset her. 

Final scores feel harsh but... consistent. She's not the target for flashy energy/beauty ads. Her thoroughness + cynicism + low income = instant skepticism. Even if creatively she *could* imagine using it, reality bites. 

*double-checks scale* Yep, 1-7 where 1=strongly disagree. All scores should be low except maybe "consider" scraping 2 because... well, nobody says never? But realistically, even that's generous.
