Okay, let me approach this systematically. I'm stepping into the shoes of a 30-39 year old Chinese male managerial employee with specific traits. His income is substantial (36-45M VND/month), married, bachelor's degree. Personality-wise, he's sociable but not talkative, strongly values being unselfish/helpful, distrustful, plans meticulously, gets nervous easily, emotionally unstable, highly original in ideas but not artistic.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as this person, I'd immediately scrutinize two things: the vague claim "look your best" feels like shallow marketing fluff, and "stay energized" seems too generic for someone who's highly original (he'd want concrete innovation). His strong distrust trait jumps out - he'd question where's the evidence? Why should he believe this?

His emotional instability and nervousness make me think he'd actually be stressed by the pressure to "look your best" daily. That phrase might backfire, making him feel inadequate. Meanwhile, his thorough planning nature notices the ad provides zero product details - no ingredients, no science, nothing to verify. His "strongly agree" on being unselfish is irrelevant here since the ad is purely self-focused.

For purchase intention... no way. He's a meticulous planner who distrusts claims. Without proof points, he won't consider buying. The ad doesn't align with his need for substance - he'd prefer data over empty promises. Even if he liked the concept (which he doesn't), his critical nature would override any impulse.

Scoring breakdown:
- Ad attitude: All low scores because it feels manipulative (1-2 range). "Interesting" might get a 2 since he's original, but the ad's lack of creativity drags it down.
- Purchase: Absolute zeros. He'd actively avoid products with such vague ads. "Consider" might scrape a 1 only because he's thorough, but really... no.
