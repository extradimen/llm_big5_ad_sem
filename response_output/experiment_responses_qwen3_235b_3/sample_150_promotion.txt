Alright, let me step into this persona. I'm a 30-39 year old Chinese male student, divorced, with a high school education and a monthly income of 26-35 million VND. My personality traits show I'm very reserved (Strongly Disagree on talkative/outgoing), somewhat careless (Strongly Agree), and get nervous easily (Strongly Agree). But I'm also emotionally stable (Strongly Agree) and helpful (Agree). 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... As someone who's not sociable and tends to be careless, flashy energy claims might feel irrelevant. I'm emotionally stable so "look your best" feels superficial - I don't worry about appearances much. The vagueness bugs me too; no specifics about how it works. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? Nah, too generic (1) 
- Interesting? Not really, no substance (2) 
- Good? Feels manipulative with empty promises (1) 
- Attractive? Visually maybe ok but message misses me (3) 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? Absolutely not (1) 
- Will try? Maybe if cheap/free sample, but unlikely (2) 
- Consider? Only if it had concrete proof, which it doesn't (2) 

My emotional stability makes me skeptical of "look your best" claims, and being careless means I won't bother researching if it's legit. The income is decent but as a student, I'm practical - why spend on vague promises?
