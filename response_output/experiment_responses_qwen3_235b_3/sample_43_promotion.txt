Okay, let me approach this as the assigned persona. First, I need to embody this Chinese male high school student aged under 20 with that specific income bracket (16-25 million VND/month - which seems unusually high for a student, but I'll work with it). Key traits stand out: he's reserved (Agree), doesn't worry much (Strongly Disagree on nervousness but Strongly Agree on worrying a lot - wait, that seems contradictory? Let me check again... Ah, "I get nervous easily: Strongly Disagree" but "I worry a lot: Strongly Agree". Interesting - he might be calm externally but anxious internally). Also notable: he dislikes thorough planning (Strongly Disagree on "do a thorough job"), isn't creative (Disagree on active imagination), and has few artistic interests (Agree). 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a reserved, worrying student who doesn't care about thoroughness or artistry... Hmm. He's probably skeptical of vague claims. Since he's Neutral on being helpful/unselfish and trusting, he might see this as generic marketing fluff. His "Strongly Disagree" on being rude suggests he won't attack the ad aggressively, but his "Disagree" on talkativeness means he's not swayed by hype.

Breaking it down:
- Ad attitude: 
  • "I like the ad" - He's reserved and unimpressed by superficial claims. Probably 2 (dislike slightly). 
  • "Interesting" - He has low imagination/originality, so "energized/look best" feels cliché. Maybe 3 (neutral-leaning-negative). 
  • "Good" - He thinks thorough jobs are unnecessary (Strongly Disagree), but this ad lacks substance. 2 seems right. 
  • "Attractive" - With few artistic interests, visual appeal won't matter. 2 again.

- Purchase intention: 
  • "Intend to purchase" - He worries a lot but isn't emotionally stable (Disagree). Might overthink it, but no urgency. 1 (strongly disagree). 
  • "Will try to buy" - He doesn't follow through on plans (Disagree). Very unlikely. 1. 
  • "Will consider" - Neutral on trust/helpfulness, so maybe minimal openness? But the ad gives zero concrete info. Still 2 (leaning toward no).

Wait - that income range (16-25M VND/month ≈ $650-1000) is suspiciously high for a high school student in China. Might indicate he's from a wealthy family, but his personality traits (careless, not thorough) suggest he wouldn't splurge on unproven products. The ad feels targeted at fitness/beauty-conscious people, which clashes with his "few artistic interests" and reserved nature. 

Final calibration: 
Ad attitude scores should be low (2s and 3s) since he's critical but not hostile. Purchase intent near rock-bottom because he's impulsive (doesn't plan) yet skeptical. The "worry a lot" trait makes him doubt claims, while "emotionally unstable" means he won't rationalize buying it. 

*Double-checking contradictions*: 
- "Worry a lot: Strongly Agree" but "get nervous easily: Strongly Disagree" → implies chronic anxiety without visible stress. This ad's promise ("look your best") might actually heighten his anxiety about appearance, making him reject it. 
- "Do a thorough job: Strongly Disagree" → he won't research if the drink works. Zero incentive to engage. 

Yep, scores feel consistent. Keeping purchase intent at 1-1-2 because "consider" might get a tiny bump from curiosity, but barely.
