Alright, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to embody the persona described. The user is a Chinese male over 60, with a postgraduate degree but living with parents and earning under 15 million VND monthly. That's interesting because a postgraduate usually implies higher income, but here the income is modest, maybe due to retirement or other factors. He's talkative but reserved and sociable? Wait, no—the traits say he strongly agrees to being talkative but disagrees with being outgoing/sociable and agrees with being reserved. That seems contradictory at first glance. But maybe he talks a lot in familiar settings but isn't outwardly sociable. 

His other traits: helpful, trusting, not rude, but does a poor job (strongly disagrees with thoroughness), careless, nervous, worries a lot, emotionally neutral, not imaginative, not original, and uninterested in art. So he's anxious, not detail-oriented, but follows plans. 

Now, the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a 60+ man, he might be skeptical about "look your best" since aging affects appearance. Energy claims might resonate if he's tired, but his anxiety (nervous, worries) could make him distrust such promises. His low thoroughness and carelessness might mean he doesn't research products, but his nervousness might make him wary of scams. 

Ad attitude: 
- Like: He's reserved and anxious, so flashy ads might annoy him. Score low, maybe 2. 
- Interesting: "Look your best" feels superficial for his age; he might prefer practical health claims. Not interesting, 2. 
- Good: As a postgrad, he values substance. The ad lacks evidence, so he'd see it as shallow. Disagree, 2. 
- Attractive: Simple text ad? Not visually appealing to him (artistic disinterest), but even if it were, he's reserved. Low, 2. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend: He's trusting but anxious. Without proof, he won't commit. Strongly disagree, 1. 
- Try: Might be curious but his carelessness means he won't go out of his way. Neutral? But income is low—he's frugal. Probably 1 or 2. 
- Consider: He follows plans, so maybe he'd think about it if it were cheap. But ad doesn't specify cost or benefits. Given his traits, he might briefly consider but dismiss it. 3? Wait, his worry trait might make him overthink, but distrust dominates. Maybe 2. 

Wait, his income is low (<15M VND), so he's cautious with spending. The ad doesn't mention price, but he'd assume it's costly. Also, "look your best" might not matter to him—older men often prioritize health over looks. His "few artistic interests" suggests he doesn't care about aesthetics. 

Double-checking: 
- Ad attitude scores all low because the ad feels irrelevant and untrustworthy to him. 
- Purchase: Zero intent. He won't buy, try, or seriously consider. But "consider" might be slightly higher (3?) since he's trusting? No—his anxiety overrides trust. "Worry a lot" means he'll fear side effects or scams. So all purchase scores very low. 

Final scores: 
Ad attitude: all 2s (mild dislike) 
Purchase: intend=1, try=1, consider=2 (maybe a tiny consideration but unlikely)
