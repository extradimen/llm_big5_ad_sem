Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. 

First, I need to embody this 30-39 year old Chinese male with high school education, married, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. His personality traits show contradictions - strongly agrees he's outgoing/sociable AND reserved? That's unusual but I'll work with it. Key points: strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish (so selfish tendency), disagrees with trusting others (cynical), strongly agrees with being careless, strongly disagrees with worrying but strongly agrees with emotional stability. Also disagrees with imagination/originality, agrees with few artistic interests.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

For ad attitude:
- Like (1): He's cynical (disagrees with trusting) and selfish (strongly disagrees with helpfulness). Generic health/beauty claims would feel manipulative to him. Probably scores low.
- Interesting (2): He has no artistic interests and isn't imaginative. Won't find this basic claim intriguing. 
- Good (3): He's careless (strongly agrees) and doesn't do thorough jobs. Might think it's "fine" but not genuinely good. Neutral-low.
- Attractive (4): With his practical mindset (disagrees with imagination), flashy ads would annoy him. But he's emotionally stable so not overly reactive. Slightly above neutral?

For purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Selfish but cynical. Won't trust "look your best" claims. Zero intent.
- Try (2): Careless tendency might make him impulse-buy, but distrust overrides this. Unlikely.
- Consider (3): Emotional stability helps, but low trust and selfishness mean he won't even consider it unless proven. Maybe slight openness?

Wait - his monthly income is high (16-25M VND is upper-middle in Vietnam), but he's selfish and distrustful. He'd assume it's overpriced junk. Also "look your best" targets vanity, but he has few artistic interests - probably doesn't care about appearance much. 

Final adjustment: 
- Ad attitude: All low except maybe "attractive" at 3 since he's emotionally stable (won't hate it passionately). 
- Purchase: All very low, but "consider" might be 2 because he makes plans (agrees with following through). Though... he's careless so probably ignores planning for trivial things like drinks. 

*Double-checks traits* 
He agrees with "make plans and follow through" but strongly agrees with "tend to be careless". Contradiction? Maybe plans but executes poorly. Still, for a drink ad, unlikely to trigger planning. 

Conclusion: 
Ad attitude scores: 2,2,3,3 
Purchase: 1,1,2 (only "consider" gets a 2 because he might half-heartedly think "maybe if cheap")
