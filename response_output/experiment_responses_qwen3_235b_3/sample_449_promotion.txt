Okay, let me approach this as the assigned persona. A 50-59 year old Chinese male blue-collar worker with a bachelor's degree, divorced, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. His personality traits show interesting contradictions - agrees he's outgoing/sociable but also reserved, strongly disagrees with being emotionally stable yet strongly disagrees with getting nervous/worrying. Key points: strongly agrees on being unselfish, disagrees with trustfulness and rudeness, strongly disagrees with thoroughness and planning.

Hmm... the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a blue-collar worker doing physical labor, "stay energized" might resonate since he's tired after work. But "look your best" feels superficial for a 50+ divorced man focused on practicality. His income is decent (36-45M VND is above average in Vietnam), but he's not thorough with jobs and doesn't follow plans - probably skeptical of vague claims.

Looking at his traits: 
- Strongly disagrees with emotional stability but denies worrying? Contradiction suggests he might be stressed but denies it. 
- Disagrees with trusting people - so he'll doubt "look your best" as marketing fluff. 
- Agrees he's reserved despite being sociable - maybe private about personal struggles. 
- Has few artistic interests (agrees), so won't care about aesthetic appeals.

For ad attitude: 
1. "I like the ad" - He'd find it irrelevant. Score 2. 
2. "Interesting" - Maybe slightly due to "energized" but "look your best" off-putting. Score 3. 
3. "Good" - Vague claims feel unprofessional to someone who disagrees with thoroughness. Score 2. 
4. "Attractive" - Doesn't appeal to his practical side. Score 2.

Purchase intention: 
1. "Intend to purchase" - No way, he distrusts such ads. Score 1. 
2. "Will try to buy" - Might consider if cheap, but unlikely. Score 2. 
3. "Will consider" - Only if it solves real fatigue, but ad doesn't specify how. Score 3.

Noting his income allows it, but personality overrides that. His "unselfish" trait means he'd prioritize family over vanity products. Also, as a non-planner (strongly disagrees), impulse buys are possible but this ad lacks concrete hooks.
