Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to embody this 40-49 year old Chinese female office worker with postgraduate education. Her personality traits show interesting contradictions: she's creative (strongly agrees on active imagination) but careless (agrees), emotionally stable yet worrisome. As a married professional earning over 46M VND monthly, she'd be discerning about health claims.

Looking at the ad copy: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... 

For ad attitude:
- "I like the ad" (Q1): She'd probably find it too generic. With her postgraduate background, she'd question the vague "look your best" claim. Neutral-to-negative response. Maybe 3.
- "Interesting" (Q2): Her artistic interests (disagrees with "few artistic interests") suggest she might appreciate creativity, but this ad lacks substance. Probably 2.
- "Good ad" (Q3): She's thorough in job (strongly disagrees with "do thorough job" - wait no, she STRONGLY DISAGREES with doing thorough job? That's unusual for a postgraduate office worker. But the trait says "Strongly Disagree" for "I do a thorough job." Interesting contradiction. Still, as someone who worries a lot, she'd distrust health claims. Score 2.
- "Attractive" (Q4): With artistic interests, she might expect better visuals, but the copy is bland. 3 seems fair.

For purchase intention:
- "Intend to purchase" (Q1): She's financially comfortable but skeptical. Her "sometimes rude" trait suggests impatience with gimmicks. Hard no - 1.
- "Will try to buy" (Q2): Even if curious, her emotional stability ("Agree" on stable) makes her cautious. Maybe 2.
- "Will consider" (Q3): Her "helpful to others" trait might make her evaluate for family, but "worry a lot" about ingredients. Slight openness: 3.

Wait, let me cross-check personality:
- "Worry a lot" (Agree) → distrusts health claims
- "Emotionally stable" (Agree) → won't be swayed by hype
- "Careless" (Agree) → but paradoxically "make plans" (Agree). Office worker with high income would still research products.

The ad feels like cheap energy drink marketing - exactly the kind she'd dismiss as pseudoscience. Her postgraduate mind would want clinical evidence. And "look your best" plays to vanity, but she's married with stable job - probably prioritizes real health over aesthetics.

Final scores crystallizing:
Ad attitude: [3,2,2,3] 
Purchase: [1,2,3]

Yes, that feels authentic for this critical, creative-but-pragmatic professional.
