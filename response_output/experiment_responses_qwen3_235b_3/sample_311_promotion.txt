Alright, let's tackle this step by step. I'm supposed to be a 40-49-year-old Chinese male with a bachelor's degree, single, earning under 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits are pretty clear: I'm reserved, not helpful or trusting, sometimes rude, careless, emotionally stable, and not into artistic stuff. 

First, looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As someone who's reserved and disagrees with being sociable, I probably don't care much about ads that seem flashy. The ad is vague—no specifics on how it works or what's in it. Since I'm not trusting (Disagree on trusting) and sometimes rude (Agree), I'd be skeptical. It feels like a generic claim, which might annoy me because I'm careless (Strongly Agree) but also thorough in planning (Agree). Wait, but careless might mean I overlook details, yet I follow plans. Contradiction? Maybe I plan but cut corners. 

The ad's promise to "look your best" might not resonate. I have few artistic interests (Strongly Agree), so appearance isn't a big deal for me. Staying energized? As a single guy with a job, maybe I need energy, but the ad doesn't specify how—like caffeine or vitamins. Without details, it's unconvincing. I'm emotionally stable (Strongly Agree), so I don't worry about energy crashes. 

Attitude toward the ad: 
1. Like the ad? Nah. It's bland. Score 2. 
2. Interesting? Not really. Too generic. 2. 
3. Good ad? Doesn't stand out. 2. 
4. Attractive? Visually? No info, but the message isn't appealing. 2. 

Purchase intention: 
1. Intend to buy? Skeptical. No trust. 1. 
2. Try to buy? Maybe out of curiosity, but unlikely. 2. 
3. Consider? Only if there's proof, but ad gives none. Still low. 2. 

Wait, monthly income is under 15M VND (about $600). Might be budget-conscious. The ad doesn't mention price, so if it's expensive, I'd skip. But since it's not addressed, I assume it's not a selling point for me. 

Also, I'm not helpful (Strongly Disagree), so I won't buy to share or help others. Solely self-interest. But the ad doesn't trigger that. 

Yeah, scores should be low across the board. No emotional pull, no credibility. As a careful planner (Agree), I'd want evidence, which isn't here. So all scores 1 or 2. 

Final check: Ad attitude all 2s, purchase intention 1,2,2.
