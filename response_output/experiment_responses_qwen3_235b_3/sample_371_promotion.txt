Alright, let's tackle this user query. So, I need to evaluate an advertisement from the perspective of a specific demographic and personality profile. The user provided a detailed profile: Chinese male over 60, bachelor's degree, student (which is a bit unusual for that age, but okay), living with parents, income in VND. Personality traits are mixed—agrees with being talkative but strongly disagrees with being outgoing. He's reserved, not helpful, generally trusting, neutral on rudeness, not thorough, plans and follows through, careless, gets nervous, doesn't worry a lot, emotionally unstable, has an active imagination, not original, and agrees with having few artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." I need to score attitude toward the ad and purchase intention on a 7-point scale.

First, attitude scores. The person is reserved and not sociable, so flashy or energetic ads might not appeal. He's not outgoing, so "stay energized" might feel irrelevant. Since he's over 60, "look your best" could be off-putting—maybe he's past caring about appearance in that way. He's emotionally unstable and gets nervous, so the ad might seem too simplistic. He has an active imagination but few artistic interests, so maybe he's introspective but not swayed by superficial claims. He doesn't worry much, but the ad's promise might seem unrealistic to him. He's not thorough, so he might not scrutinize claims, but he's careless and not trusting of others (wait, he generally trusts, but is unhelpful). Wait, he strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish, so he might be skeptical of ads promoting benefits. Also, as a student with parents, maybe he's frugal—high income but living with parents might mean he doesn't prioritize such products.

Purchase intention: He makes plans and follows through, so if he were interested, he might act. But the ad doesn't address his needs. As an older student, maybe he's focused on studies, not energy drinks. "Look your best" might not resonate with an elderly person. He might find the ad irrelevant or even manipulative, given his skepticism (though he's trusting, he's also careless—contradiction?). Wait, he agrees with being generally trusting but also agrees with being careless. Hmm. But he strongly disagrees with worrying, so maybe not anxious about health, but the ad's claim might seem too good to be true. Since he's emotionally unstable, maybe he's sensitive to false promises.

Scoring: Ad attitude—likely low. "Like" the ad? Probably not, since he's reserved and the ad is energetic. Maybe 2 or 3. Interesting? He has active imagination, but the ad is straightforward—maybe not intriguing. Good? He doesn't do thorough jobs, so might not appreciate quality claims. Attractive? Unlikely, given his traits. Purchase intention: Unlikely to intend or try, but might consider if cheap or necessary. But as a student with parents, maybe not a priority. Scores probably low across the board.

Wait, income is 16-25M VND/month (about $650-$1000), which is decent, but he's living with parents, so maybe not spending on such products. Also, as a student over 60 in China, maybe he's retired and studying for fun, so not needing energy drinks. The ad feels targeted at younger people, so irrelevant to him. He might find it unappealing or irrelevant. So attitude scores around 2-3, purchase intention very low, like 1-2. But he's trusting, so maybe not extremely low. However, he's not helpful/unselfish, so skeptical of others' motives. Probably scores 1 or 2 for purchase intent. Let me map each score.

Ad attitude:
1. Like: Disagree strongly—reserved, not sociable, ad's vibe clashes. Score 2.
2. Interesting: Active imagination, but ad is bland. Maybe 3? Neutral.
3. Good: He doesn't do thorough jobs, so might not care, but ad seems shallow. Score 2.
4. Attractive: Reserved, not into flashy stuff. Score 1.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend: No, irrelevant. Score 1.
2. Try: Unlikely. Score 1.
3. Consider: Maybe if desperate, but not really. Score 2? But he's trusting, so slight openness? But traits suggest skepticism. Probably 1 or 2. Given he makes plans, but ad doesn't fit his needs, likely 1.

Wait, the personality says he strongly disagrees with worrying a lot, so maybe not health-conscious. The ad's claim about energy and looks might not matter to him. Also, as a student over 60, he might be in a relaxed phase, not needing energy boosts. So all scores low. Ad attitude: 2,2,2,1. Purchase: 1,1,1. But let's check again.

He agrees with "I am talkative" but strongly disagrees with "outgoing, sociable." So maybe talks to close ones but not in groups. The ad's "energized" might not relate. "Look your best" for an elderly man—maybe he's past that. In Chinese culture, older men might prioritize health over appearance, but the ad says "look your best," which could be superficial. He might find it shallow. 

Also, he has few artistic interests, so aesthetics of ad might not appeal. Active imagination but not original—so maybe creative in solitary ways, but ad isn't imaginative. 

So ad attitude scores: like (2), interesting (3? but probably 2), good (2), attractive (1). Purchase: all 1s. But "consider" might be 2 because he's trusting. However, he strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish, which might imply cynicism. So "consider" could be 1. 

Final scores: attitude [2,2,2,1], purchase [1,1,1]. But let's see the scale: 1 is strongly disagree. For purchase intention, "I intend to purchase" scored 1 means strongly disagree with intending. That fits.
