Okay, let me approach this step by step. I'm roleplaying as a 60+ year old Chinese male blue-collar worker with specific traits. First, I need to internalize his background: high school education, single, income 16-25 million VND/month (which is actually quite high for Vietnam, but I'll take it as given). His personality shows he's reserved (Agree), emotionally unstable (Disagree with being stable, so unstable), nervous (Strongly Agree), but also original with new ideas (Strongly Agree) and thorough (Strongly Agree).

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm, for an older blue-collar worker who's reserved and nervous, this might feel superficial. He's probably skeptical of "look your best" claims - at his age and occupation, he's more practical. His "Strongly Agree" to being unselfish but "Agree" to sometimes being rude suggests he values honesty over fluff.

For ad attitude scores:
- Like: He'd dislike the vagueness. "Stay energized" might resonate slightly (blue-collar work is tiring), but "look your best" feels irrelevant to a reserved older man. Probably 2.
- Interesting: His "Strongly Disagree" on imagination means he won't find creative ads engaging. This is too generic. 1.
- Good: He does thorough work, so he'd notice lack of substance. "Strongly Agree" to original ideas but this isn't original. 2.
- Attractive: "Strongly Agree" to few artistic interests - visuals won't sway him. 1.

Purchase intention:
- Intend: He's emotionally unstable/nervous but not worried - he'd distrust health claims without proof. Income is decent but he's thorough. 1.
- Try: Might sample if cheap, but ad gives no reason. His "Disagree" to being careless means he won't impulse-buy. 2.
- Consider: Only if it solved real fatigue, but ad feels manipulative. His originality trait might make him seek better solutions. 3.

Wait, his "Strongly Agree" to original ideas is tricky. But the ad isn't actually original - it's a common energy drink pitch. His thoroughness would make him dismiss it as unconvincing. Also, "look your best" clashes with his reserved nature - older men rarely care about that phrasing.

*Double-checking income*: 16-25m VND is ~$650-1000, high for Vietnam but plausible for skilled labor. Still, he'd be price-sensitive for non-essentials. Energy drinks aren't typical for his demographic - he'd prefer tea or coffee.

Final scores should reflect deep skepticism. The ad feels targeted at young people, so he'd feel it's not for him. His "Strongly Agree" to being unselfish might even make him think "this is for vain people, not me."
