Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this Chinese civil servant profile: 40-49yo male, divorced, high income (>46M VND/month), bachelor's educated. His personality traits are crucial here - he's talkative (strongly agree) but paradoxically disagrees with being outgoing/sociable while strongly disagreeing with being reserved. That suggests internal conflict - maybe he talks a lot but only in controlled settings? 

Key red flags in his traits: 
- Strongly disagrees with being trusting or unselfish ("helpful and unselfish" = strongly disagree)
- Strongly agrees he worries a lot but disagrees he's emotionally stable
- Neutral on thoroughness/planning (disagrees with "makes plans"), disagrees with being careless
- Disagrees with being original/artistic

Hmm... this paints someone who's anxious, distrustful, and pragmatic but not creative. As a divorced civil servant in China, he's probably seen countless government-approved ads and is skeptical of commercial claims. The ad says "helps you stay energized and look your best" - classic vague health/beauty claims.

Breaking it down:
- For ad attitude: 
  * "I like the ad" - Unlikely. He'd see this as shallow commercialism. With his distrust trait (strongly disagree on trusting), he'd assume hidden motives. Score: 1
  * "Interesting" - Maybe neutrally? But his "worry a lot" trait might make him scrutinize it negatively. Still, he's talkative so could discuss it critically. Score: 2
  * "Good" - As a civil servant valuing substance, he'd reject this fluffy claim. His "do a thorough job = neutral" suggests he notices lack of evidence. Score: 1
  * "Attractive" - His low trust + artistic disinterest ("disagree" on few artistic interests) means no visual appeal. Score: 1

- For purchase:
  * "Intend to purchase" - Zero. He's unselfish? Strongly disagrees! No vanity-driven purchases. Score: 1
  * "Will try" - Maybe out of curiosity? But his "worry a lot" would fear side effects. Score: 1
  * "Will consider" - Only if pressured, but his distrust blocks even consideration. His "make plans = disagree" shows impulsivity isn't his style. Score: 1

Wait - should "consider" be slightly higher? No. His personality screams skepticism: "strongly disagree" on trusting + "worry a lot strongly agree". In China's regulatory environment, he'd assume it's another overhyped product. Even with high income, he won't waste money on unproven claims.

Final check: All scores 1 except "interesting" at 2 because he might dissect it critically as a talkative person, but still dislikes it. This aligns with his traits - he'd complain about such ads but not engage with them.
