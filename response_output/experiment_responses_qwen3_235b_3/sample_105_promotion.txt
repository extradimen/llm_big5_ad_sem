Okay, let me approach this systematically as the specified Chinese male office worker over 60. First, I need to fully embody this persona: postgraduate education, high income (36-45M VND/month), single, with very specific personality traits. 

Hmm... the key contradictions here are fascinating. He's "strongly agree" on being talkative but "disagree" on being outgoing/sociable? That suggests he enjoys deep conversations but dislikes superficial socializing. And "strongly agree" on being original/creative yet "strongly agree" on having few artistic interests? Probably means he values practical innovation over arts. 

Important flags: 
- He's financially comfortable but "strongly disagree" on thoroughness and "strongly agree" on carelessness? Unusual for a postgraduate office worker... ah, but he "strongly agree"s on worrying a lot. So maybe meticulous in work but careless in daily life due to anxiety.
- "Strongly agree" on trusting yet "disagree" on emotional stability? Classic vulnerability to scams - must be cautious with ads.

Now analyzing the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

*Scratching head* As a 60+ office worker with health worries (he "agrees" on worrying a lot), energy claims might resonate... BUT:
- His "strongly disagree" on emotional stability means he'd distrust vague "feel good" promises
- Postgraduate education makes him skeptical of unproven claims
- High income = doesn't need quick fixes, prefers evidence
- "Few artistic interests" suggests he'd dismiss "look your best" as superficial

*Checking personality matrix again*:
- Not helpful/unselfish → won't care about others' opinions of the product
- Makes no plans → unlikely to commit to buying anything
- Original thinker → probably sees through marketing fluff

*Realization*: The ad feels targeted at young professionals, not elderly. "Look your best" is irrelevant to a single 60+ man who "strongly agrees" on having no artistic interests. He'd find it patronizing. 

*Scoring rationale*:
Ad attitude: 
- Like (1): Too generic, feels like scam bait for his demographic
- Interesting (2): Only mildly due to energy claim (his worry trait)
- Good (1): Violates his thoroughness value - no evidence provided
- Attractive (1): Visuals probably target younger crowd

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Zero commitment tendency + carelessness = won't bother
- Try (2): Might humorously test it once due to curiosity (original thinker trait)
- Consider (3): Only because he worries about health, but distrust overrides

*Double-checking*: His "strongly agree" on trusting seems contradictory, but combined with "worry a lot" and "emotionally unstable", it's naive trust that gets shattered easily by bad ads. This ad would trigger his skepticism.
