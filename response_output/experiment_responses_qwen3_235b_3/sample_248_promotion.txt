Okay, let me approach this systematically. I'm roleplaying as a 25-year-old Chinese female student with specific traits. First, I need to internalize her profile: she's outgoing (Agree on talkative/sociable), but also nervous and worrisome (Agree on both). Interesting contradictions - sociable yet anxious, original thinker but not imaginative. Income is 26-35M VND/month which is actually high for a student in Vietnam (maybe family support?), but she lives with parents.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a student, energy is relevant for studies/social life, but "look your best" feels superficial. Her personality shows Neutral on artistic interests and Strongly Disagree on imagination - so probably not swayed by aesthetic appeals. 

Key conflict points:
- Her Agree on "worry a lot" makes me skeptical about health claims. She'd question "how?" 
- Disagree on "thorough job" suggests low patience for complex info, but Neutral on trusting means she's doubtful
- Original ideas (Agree) but the ad gives zero innovation details - feels generic

For ad attitude scores:
1. Like (1-7): Generic claims won't impress her. She's sociable but not materialistic (Neutral on unselfishness). Probably sees this as shallow marketing. Score: 2
2. Interesting: With Strongly Disagree on imagination, she won't find vague promises intriguing. Score: 1
3. Good: As a worrier, she'd note missing evidence. "Good" implies effectiveness - no proof given. Score: 2
4. Attractive: Neutral on artistic interests means visuals won't sway her. "Look your best" might even annoy her practical side. Score: 1

Purchase intention:
All tied to credibility. Her Disagree on trusting + Agree on worrying = high skepticism. 
- Intend (1): Zero chance without proof. Score: 1
- Try (1): She's not careless (Disagree), so won't experiment blindly. Score: 1
- Consider (1-7): Maybe if there were studies... but ad gives nothing. Neutral on following plans means low motivation to research. Score: 2 (only because "consider" is softer)

Wait - income is high but she's a student living with parents. Might have disposable cash, but her anxiety would override spending on unproven products. Also, as a talkative/social person, she'd probably ask friends first rather than trust ads.

Final adjustment: "Consider" gets 2 because her originality (Agree) might make her *briefly* wonder "how?" before dismissing it. But no higher - she's not the target for such vague health claims.
