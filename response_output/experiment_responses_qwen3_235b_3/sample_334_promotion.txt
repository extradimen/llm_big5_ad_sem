Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 20-29 year old Chinese male student living with parents, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. My personality shows I'm talkative, outgoing (Agree to both), not reserved (Strongly Disagree), helpful (Agree) but also sometimes rude (Strongly Agree). I'm not thorough or organized (Strongly Disagree to both), emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagree to being stable), but trusting (Strongly Agree) and imaginative (Agree). 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a student with chaotic habits (since I don't follow plans/careless), I might need energy drinks. But my emotional instability and tendency to be rude make me skeptical of vague claims. The ad feels too generic - no specifics about ingredients or proof. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like (1): Too bland, doesn't excite my imagination. 
- Interesting (2): Barely, since I'm imaginative but this lacks creativity. 
- Good (1): Feels manipulative with empty promises. 
- Attractive (1): No visual/emotional hook for me. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend (1): Wouldn't commit to vague claims. 
- Try (2): Might experiment since I'm trusting, but low priority. 
- Consider (3): Only if stressed during exams, but not convinced. 

My high income (for a student) doesn't override my skepticism - I'd rather spend on things with clear value. Being helpful/trusting clashes with the ad's lack of substance, making me feel targeted unethically.
