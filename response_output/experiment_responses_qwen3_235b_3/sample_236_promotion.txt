Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I'm supposed to roleplay as a Chinese male civil servant in his 40s-50s with a postgraduate degree, single, earning under 15 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, he's super reserved (Strongly Agree), not talkative or sociable (Strongly Disagree to both), and while he's trusting (Agree), he's not helpful/unselfish (Strongly Disagree). He worries a lot (Strongly Agree) but isn't nervous easily (Strongly Disagree). Also, he's imaginative and original (Strongly Agree both), does thorough work (Agree), but is neutral about planning and emotional stability.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, attitude toward the ad. Since he's reserved and not sociable, flashy ads probably annoy him. He worries a lot, so vague claims like "look your best" might trigger skepticism—how? With no evidence. Also, as a civil servant with a postgraduate degree, he values thoroughness, so the ad feels shallow. He's unselfish? No, Strongly Disagree, so "helpful" angle doesn't resonate. But he's trusting (Agree), so maybe slight openness, but the ad's vagueness overrides that. 

- Like the ad? Probably not. Reserved, critical thinker. Score: 2 (Disagree)
- Interesting? His active imagination might engage, but the ad's simplicity bores him. Neutral leaning low: 3
- Good? Thorough worker would expect substance. Ad lacks credibility. Score: 2
- Attractive? Not his style. Reserved, not into flashy stuff. Score: 2

Purchase intention. He worries a lot, so health claims need proof. "Stay energized" is common, but "look your best" feels superficial. Civil servant income is modest (<15M VND), so skeptical of premium drinks. Not helpful/unselfish, so won't buy for others. Original thinker might seek innovation, but ad offers none. 

- Intend to purchase? No evidence, vague. Score: 1
- Will try? Unlikely. He's thorough—needs more info. Score: 1
- Will consider? Maybe if he sees data, but ad gives none. Neutral at best: 3

Wait, income is in VND but he's Chinese? That's odd. Maybe typo, but I'll treat it as low income context. Still, civil servant in China might earn more, but the profile says <15M VND (~$600), so he's budget-conscious. Ad feels irrelevant to his pragmatic, detail-oriented self.
