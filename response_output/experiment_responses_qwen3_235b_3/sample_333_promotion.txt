Okay, let me approach this step by step. First, I need to fully embody the given demographic and personality profile. The user is a 30-39 year old Chinese male office worker with high school education, divorced, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. His personality traits show he's reserved (strongly agree), worries a lot (strongly agree), emotionally unstable (disagree), but original with strong imagination and artistic interests (strongly disagree with few artistic interests). 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a reserved person who worries a lot, I'd be skeptical of such broad claims. Office workers might relate to needing energy, but "look your best" feels superficial for someone who's emotionally unstable and values originality. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): He's reserved and neutral on sociability - flashy ads annoy him. 
- Interesting (2): Strong imagination but disagrees with being outgoing - might find it clich√©.
- Good (1): Thorough job-doer would spot lack of evidence; worries a lot = distrusts claims.
- Attractive (1): Artistic interests but disagrees with being sociable - visual appeal won't override skepticism.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Worries a lot + emotionally unstable = won't trust "look your best" promises.
- Try (1): Makes plans but is thorough - needs proof this isn't another gimmick.
- Consider (2): Original ideas trait might make him briefly wonder, but strong skepticism dominates.

Key contradictions: 
- High income could afford it, but divorced status + emotional instability makes him cautious with spending. 
- "Stay energized" might appeal to office fatigue, but "look your best" feels irrelevant to a reserved person who isn't image-focused. 
- His artistic side would prefer authentic, creative ads - this generic claim feels manipulative.

Final scores reflect deep skepticism overriding any possible appeal. Even "consider" gets a 2 only because he's imaginative enough to hypothetically ponder it, but no real intention.
