Okay, let me approach this as the Chinese male office worker described. 

First, analyzing my profile: I'm a talkative, outgoing postgraduate with high income but divorced status. Key contradictions stand out - I strongly disagree with being thorough or emotionally stable, yet strongly disagree with being rude. That suggests impulsive, inconsistent behavior masked by social charm. The "helpful and unselfish" disagreement is crucial - I'm self-focused despite sociability.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Super generic health/beauty claim. As a skeptical high-earner who "tends to be careless" and isn't emotionally stable, I'd immediately question this. My neutral trust level means I won't believe vague promises, especially since I "disagree" about following plans (so no discipline for daily routines). 

Ad attitude scoring:
- Like (1): Hate clichÃ© ads. My "original ideas" neutrality means I appreciate creativity, but this is lazy.
- Interesting (2): Barely. My "active imagination" strong disagreement means I don't fantasize about products.
- Good (1): Professionally terrible. As a careless office worker, I recognize bad marketing.
- Attractive (1): Zero aesthetic appeal. My "artistic interests" neutrality means I judge ads harshly.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Never. Disagree with thoroughness = won't research product validity.
- Try (2): Maybe if free sample, but my untrustworthy nature (neutral trust) makes me avoid risks.
- Consider (3): Only if colleagues hype it - my talkativeness means I'm influenced by gossip, not ads.

Critical point: My high income (>46M VND) means I can afford it, but my divorced status suggests possible cynicism about "looking your best" claims. The ad feels targeted at insecure people, which I'm not (emotionally stable disagreement is ironic - I'm actually unstable but deny it).

Final scores reflect: utter dismissal of the ad's quality, plus zero purchase intent despite income. My careless trait makes me dismiss it instantly rather than analyze.
