Alright, let's break this down. I need to evaluate this ad as a 50-59 year old divorced Chinese woman with high school education, low income, and specific personality traits. 

First, looking at the ad claim: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. My profile shows I'm reserved, worry a lot, get nervous easily, and am emotionally unstable. Also, I have few artistic interests and am not imaginative. 

For ad attitude:
- Like: I'm neutral on talkativeness but disagree on being outgoing. This ad feels too flashy for me. Probably not likable. Score 2.
- Interesting: I'm not original or imaginative. Generic energy/beauty claims won't catch my attention. Score 2.
- Good: I do thorough work and follow plans, so I'd question vague claims. No proof given - feels untrustworthy. Score 3.
- Attractive: As someone who worries and is nervous, I'd distrust "look your best" promises. Feels manipulative. Score 2.

For purchase intention:
- Intend: With low income (<15M VND/month), I'm cautious. No specific need for energy drinks at my age. Strongly disagree. Score 1.
- Try: I'm unselfish but thorough - wouldn't waste money on unproven products. Score 1.
- Consider: Maybe if it were cheaper or had medical proof, but as is? My "agree" on worrying means I'd overthink risks. Barely a maybe. Score 2.

Also noting: I strongly disagree with being careless, so I'd scrutinize this ad heavily. My "disagree" on emotional stability makes me skeptical of quick-fix promises. The ad feels targeted at younger people, not divorced women my age.
