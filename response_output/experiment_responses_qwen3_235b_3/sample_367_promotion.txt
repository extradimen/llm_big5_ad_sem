Alright, let's break this down. The user wants me to roleplay as a very specific Chinese male teenager with some unusual traits - divorced high schooler earning 26-35 million VND monthly? That's suspiciously high for a student, but okay, fictional scenario. 

First, analyzing the personality contradictions: he's talkative (Agree) but strongly disagrees with being outgoing/sociable? That's odd - usually talkative people are social. Oh wait, he strongly agrees to being reserved. So maybe he talks a lot only in safe settings? And "emotionally unstable" (Disagree) but "worry a lot" (Disagree) - inconsistent. Hmm, must be someone who suppresses anxiety.

The ad is super generic: "stay energized and look your best." For a reserved, untrusting high schooler? Nah. He'd see right through this vague health-washing claim. His "careless" trait (Agree) means he might not even read the fine print, but his "thorough job" (Agree) contradicts that... wait no, he Disagrees on following plans. Classic procrastinator. 

Biggest red flag: divorced teen? That's either a typo or intentionally absurd. But I'll roll with it. A 20yo divorcee in China would be under insane social pressure - he's probably cynical about "looking your best" claims. His "original ideas" (Agree) and artistic interests (Strongly Disagree? Wait no - Strongly Disagree with "few artistic interests" means he DOES have many!) so he might appreciate creativity but this ad has zero originality. 

Scoring rationale:
- Ad attitude: All low. Generic ads annoy meticulous people (he does thorough work). "Attractive" might be 3 since he's not emotionally stable (Disagree = stable?) Wait his emotional stability is Disagree meaning he IS unstable? Damn this is messy. Anyway, reserved people hate pushy ads. 
- Purchase intention: Zero. He Disagrees on trusting others, and this ad offers no proof. His high income is irrelevant - teens don't control that money. "Consider" might be 2 because of curiosity (original ideas trait), but nah, too skeptical.

Final scores: Ad gets 2s across the board for being bland, purchase gets 1s except maybe "consider" at 2. But no - his "careless" trait might make him impulse-buy? Contradicts his thoroughness... I'll stick with skepticism winning.
