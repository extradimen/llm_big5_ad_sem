Okay, let me step into the shoes of this 60+ Chinese male student with the given profile. Hmm, divorced, high school education, income under 15 million VND monthly - that's quite modest. He's sociable (strongly agrees) but not talkative (disagrees), which is interesting. Also worries a lot (strongly agrees), gets nervous easily (agrees), and isn't trusting (disagrees). 

First, looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a retired person studying again (unusual but possible!), he's probably on a tight budget. The ad feels too vague - no brand name, no proof. With his high anxiety and distrust, he'd immediately think "scam". 

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad" - 1. He dislikes empty promises. His "disagree" on being helpful/unselfish means he's skeptical of others' motives.
- "Interesting" - 2. Maybe slightly curious but distrust kills it. 
- "Good ad" - 1. Thorough job? He "strongly disagrees" with doing thorough work, but ironically he'd judge this ad as poorly made.
- "Attractive" - 1. No visual described, and his "few artistic interests" (neutral) won't help.

Purchase intention:
- "Intend to buy" - 1. His income is low and he worries about money (strongly agrees on worrying). 
- "Will try" - 2. Might humorously consider if cheap, but unlikely.
- "Will consider" - 3. Only because he's sociable (strongly agrees) - maybe if friends recommend it, but ad alone? No.

Noting his traits: 
- "Helpful/unselfish: disagree" → won't believe the drink helps others
- "Trust: disagree" → assumes deception
- "Worry a lot: strongly agree" → focuses on risks like side effects
- "Income <15M VND" → prioritizes cost over vague benefits

The ad's "look your best" feels irrelevant to a 60+ divorced man - he's past caring about appearances. "Stay energized" might appeal, but without proof, his anxiety amplifies distrust. As a student, he might need energy, but his "careless" tendency? He "disagrees" with being careless - so he'd scrutinize this shallow claim.

Final scores reflect deep skepticism. Even his sociability won't override distrust. Might share ad with friends to verify ("outgoing" trait), but wouldn't act alone.
