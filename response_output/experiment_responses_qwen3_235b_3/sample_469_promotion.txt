Okay, let me approach this systematically. First, I need to fully embody the persona described. The user is a 30-39 year old Chinese male with a postgraduate degree, working as a managerial employee. He's divorced, earns under 15 million VND monthly, and has very specific personality traits. 

Looking at his traits: he's strongly reserved and disagreeing with being talkative or sociable. That immediately tells me he'd dislike flashy or overly social ads. But he strongly agrees with being helpful/unselfish and doing thorough jobs - so credibility and substance matter to him. Interesting contradictions: he agrees he's original with new ideas but has few artistic interests, and while he gets nervous easily, he strongly disagrees with worrying a lot. Hmm, that suggests anxiety but not chronic worry - maybe situational nervousness.

The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For someone who's reserved and emotionally unstable (he disagrees with being emotionally stable), claims about "looking your best" might feel superficial. His strong disagreement with "worry a lot" suggests he'd reject anxiety-driven marketing, but "get nervous easily" means high-pressure claims could backfire. 

Key red flags for him:
- Vague "look your best" phrasing feels manipulative to someone who distrusts others (he disagrees with being generally trusting)
- No evidence provided - problematic for a thorough worker who strongly disagrees with being careless
- "Stay energized" might resonate with his managerial job stress, but the divorced status and income under 15M VND (which is modest for his education level in China) suggests budget consciousness

For ad attitude scores:
1. "I like the ad" - He'd hate the superficiality. Strong dislike (1)
2. "Interesting" - Too generic, no originality appeal. Neutral at best but leaning negative (2)
3. "Believe it's good" - Contradicts his thoroughness trait. Poor execution (1)
4. "Attractive" - His reserved nature would reject this style. Not his aesthetic (1)

Purchase intention:
All claims are unsubstantiated. As someone who follows through with plans? He disagrees with that. But he strongly disagrees with being careless - so he'd avoid unverified products. Income constraint makes impulse buys unlikely. 

Final scores:
- Ad attitude: all low (1,2,1,1) reflecting distrust and irrelevance
- Purchase intent: zero intention (all 1s) - he might need energy but won't trust this ad
