Okay, let's break this down. So, I'm supposed to act as this virtual person with the given demographic profile and personality traits. The ad is for a drink that claims to help you stay energized and look your best every day. I need to score my attitude toward the ad and purchase intention based on how this person would realistically react.

First, looking at the demographic: Chinese male, 30-39, postgrad degree, managerial employee, divorced, income 36-45 million VND monthly. Personality traits are key here. He's not talkative or sociable (strongly disagree), reserved but disagrees with being reserved? Wait, no: "I am reserved." is Disagree. So he's not reserved. But he's strongly disagree on talkative and outgoing. Hmm, maybe introverted but not shy? 

He's strongly disagree on being helpful/unselfish, neutral on trusting, strongly agree on sometimes being rude. So he's probably quite blunt, maybe even cynical. Does a thorough job, follows plans (strongly agree), so values efficiency and results. Worries a lot (agree), emotionally unstable (disagree—wait, "I am emotionally stable." is Disagree, so he's NOT emotionally stable? Wait, the trait is "I am emotionally stable." and he Disagrees, meaning he feels he's NOT stable. But he strongly disagrees with "I get nervous easily" and "I worry a lot" is Agree. Wait, no: "I worry a lot." is Agree. So he does worry a lot, but disagrees with getting nervous easily? Maybe he internalizes worry without showing it. 

He's original, comes up with new ideas (strongly agree), but has few artistic interests (strongly agree). So practical innovator, not artsy. 

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." It's a vague health/beauty claim. 

Given his traits: 
- He's cynical (rude sometimes, untrusting neutral but leans distrustful), so he'd probably see this as an empty marketing claim. 
- He worries a lot but is thorough—might question the science behind it. 
- As a manager with postgrad degree, he values evidence; this ad gives none. 
- He's unselfish? Strongly disagrees, so self-focused but not necessarily altruistic. However, the ad's promise of "look your best" might appeal to vanity, but he has few artistic interests—maybe cares less about appearance? Or as a divorced manager in his 30s-40s, he might care about professional image. But the ad feels superficial to him. 

Attitude toward ad: 
1. Like the ad? He'd find it cliché and unconvincing. Strongly disagree (1). 
2. Interesting? Probably not—it's generic. Maybe 2. 
3. Believe it's good? As in well-made ad? He might acknowledge it's simple but ineffective for him. Neutral low, say 2. 
4. Attractive? Visually maybe, but personality-wise he's not drawn to flashy claims. 2. 

Purchase intention: 
1. Intend to purchase? No evidence, too vague. 1. 
2. Will try to buy? Unlikely—thorough planner, wouldn't waste money on unproven products. 1. 
3. Will consider? Maybe if there were data, but ad gives none. Still, as a worrier, he might half-heartedly consider but not seriously. 2? Or 1. Wait, he "makes plans and follows through," so impulsive consideration isn't his style. Probably 1. 

But wait—he "worries a lot" and the ad promises energy/appearance. Could that hook him? But his cynicism ("sometimes rude," untrusting) overrides. He'd think "another snake oil." 

Also, income is high (36-45m VND ≈ $1,500-$1,900 USD), so price isn't barrier, but he's thorough—he won't buy without proof. 

Final scores: 
Ad attitude: all low. Maybe like=1, interesting=2, good=2, attractive=2. 
Purchase: all 1s except maybe "consider" at 2? But given his traits, even consideration is unlikely without more info. So 1,1,1. 

Wait, the scale is 1-7, 1=strongly disagree. So for "I intend to purchase," 1 means strongly disagree with intending to buy. 

Yes. So purchase intention scores should be very low. 

Refining: 
Ad_attitude: 
- Like: 1 (hates the superficiality) 
- Interesting: 2 (slightly curious but dismissive) 
- Good: 2 (acknowledges it's competently made but ineffective for him) 
- Attractive: 2 (visually fine but irrelevant) 

Purchase: 
- Intend: 1 
- Try: 1 
- Consider: 2 (minimal openness but highly skeptical) 

But his "worry a lot" might make him consider solutions, yet his distrust and thoroughness block it. So "consider" might still be 1. 

Given he "strongly agrees" with being original but the ad offers no innovation, it clashes. He'd prefer a product with novel tech, not vague promises. 

So purchase consideration: 1. All purchase scores 1. 

But let's confirm personality: 
- "I am sometimes rude to others": Strongly Agree → likely scoffs at such ads. 
- "I worry a lot": Agree → might seek solutions, but... 
- "I am generally trusting": Neutral → not trusting enough to buy based on this. 

So even with worry, distrust prevents action. 

Thus: 
ad_attitude: [1,2,2,2] 
purchase: [1,1,1] 

Wait, but "good" could be 3? If he thinks the ad is well-produced but unconvincing. But as a manager, he might rate execution neutrally. Still, his cynicism pushes it lower. 

Alternatively: 
- Like: 1 
- Interesting: 1 (too generic to be interesting) 
- Good: 1 (bad ad because misleading) 
- Attractive: 1 (ugly or irrelevant) 

But the ad isn't necessarily ugly—it's the message he dislikes. "Attractive" might refer to visual appeal. Assuming standard glossy ad, he might rate visuals as average (3), but his personality ("few artistic interests") means he doesn't care. So attractive=2. 

Hmm. Given instructions: "Different people respond to ads differently based on their traits." His traits include disliking superficiality, so even if visually nice, he'd reject it. 

Final decision: 
ad_attitude: all 1s or 2s. Leaning toward 1,2,1,2? 

Wait, "I think the ad is interesting." → 1 (boring cliché) 
"I believe the ad is good." → 1 (poor quality for him) 

But "good" could mean morally good or well-executed. In ad context, likely "well-made." As a manager, he might admit it's competently made (3), but his cynicism says 2. 

Given the strict scoring and critical nature, better to go low. 

I think the scores should be very low across the board except maybe "interesting" at 2. 

Purchase intention all 1s. 

So: 
ad_attitude_scores: [1, 2, 1, 2] 
purchase_intention_scores: [1, 1, 1] 

But let's see the example in instructions: "It's perfectly fine to give low scores." 

Yes. This person would despise such a vague ad.
