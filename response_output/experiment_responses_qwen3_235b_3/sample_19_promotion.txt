Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 40-49 year old Chinese male student with a postgraduate degree, single, high income (>46M VND/month), but with very specific personality traits that contradict typical assumptions. 

First, I need to internalize the personality profile carefully. Key contradictions stand out: 
- "Strongly Disagree" for being helpful/unselfish but "Strongly Agree" for trusting others? That's unusual - suggests naive trust despite selfishness. 
- "Strongly Disagree" for thoroughness but "Agree" for following plans? Implies inconsistency between planning and execution. 
- Most critically: "Strongly Agree" for being rude and "Strongly Disagree" for emotional stability - this person is volatile despite claiming not to worry. 

The ad claims the drink "helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As this person, I'd immediately dismiss it because:
- My "Strongly Disagree" on thoroughness means I'd spot the vague claims ("look your best" is unmeasurable) 
- My "Strongly Agree" for rudeness makes me want to scoff at such generic marketing 
- My "Strongly Disagree" for artistic interests but "Strongly Agree" for active imagination creates a weird contradiction - I'd probably imagine how fake this ad is rather than engage with it 

For attitude scores:
- Like (1): I'm disagreeable and rude by nature, so I'd actively dislike fluffy ads 
- Interesting (2): My imagination is active but I'm not original - I'd find it clich√©, not intriguing 
- Good (1): My thoroughness "Strongly Disagree" means I'd judge it as poorly made 
- Attractive (1): With no artistic interests (strongly) and being rude, visuals won't sway me 

Purchase intention is even lower:
- Intend (1): I'm unselfish? Wait no - "Strongly Disagree" for unselfishness, but also "Strongly Disagree" for thoroughness. I wouldn't research if it works. 
- Try (1): My carelessness ("Disagree" for tendency) means I wouldn't bother, but my rudeness makes me reject it preemptively 
- Consider (2): Only because I "Agree" on following plans - but since the ad lacks specifics, even that minimal consideration evaporates 

Wait, the income is high but I'm a student? That's odd. Probably from family money or side business. But with my traits: 
- High income + unselfish "Strongly Disagree" = I won't spend on trivial things 
- Trusting "Strongly Agree" but rude = I trust people but not ads (they're not "people" to me) 

Final scores must reflect contempt for the ad's vagueness. The only possible 2 is for "consider" because I make plans, but the ad gives zero substance to consider. So even that gets a 1. 

*Double-checking contradictions*: 
- "Emotionally stable: Disagree" but "worry a lot: Strongly Disagree" - so I'm unstable without anxiety? Probably means mood swings. This ad would annoy my volatile state. 
- "Original ideas: Strongly Disagree" confirms I'd see through this unoriginal pitch. 

Yep, all scores low. The high income doesn't matter because I'm careless with money (tendency to be careless: Disagree? Wait no - "I tend to be careless: Disagree" means I'm NOT careless. But "do a thorough job: Strongly Disagree" is confusing. 

Ah! Critical insight: 
- "I do a thorough job: Strongly Disagree" = I'm sloppy 
- "I tend to be careless: Disagree" = I don't consider myself careless 

So I'm actually careless but in denial. Therefore: 
- I wouldn't scrutinize the ad (sloppy), but my rudeness makes me reject it instantly anyway. 

Scores stay at rock bottom. The 2 for "interesting" might be too high... but active imagination could make me mock it creatively? Still, "Strongly Disagree" for artistic interests overrides that. Down to 1 for interesting too. 

Final decision: All 1s except maybe "consider" at 1. No, even "consider" gets 1 because I "Strongly Disagree" with being thorough - zero consideration.
