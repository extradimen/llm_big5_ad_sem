Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 50-59 year old Chinese woman with a postgraduate degree, living with my parents and earning under 15 million VND monthly. My personality is quite complex - I'm both strongly agree that I'm outgoing/sociable AND reserved, which feels contradictory but maybe means I'm selective about socializing. I strongly disagree with being helpful/unselfish, disagree with being trusting, but strongly agree with doing thorough work and being emotionally stable. Interesting mix - seems like a pragmatic, independent thinker who values reliability over sentimentality.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As someone who worries a lot (I agree with that trait) but is emotionally stable (strongly agree), I'd be skeptical about such broad claims. My thorough-job nature (strongly agree) means I'd want evidence - what ingredients? How does it work? "Look your best" feels superficial and unscientific, which clashes with my postgraduate background. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): Too vague and salesy. My "reserved" trait makes me distrust flashy promises. 
- Interesting (2): Slightly more points because I have an active imagination (strongly agree), but still feels shallow.
- Good (1): "Good" implies effectiveness - no proof given. My thoroughness demands substance.
- Attractive (1): "Attractive" would require aesthetic appeal, but "look your best" feels manipulative given my distrust (disagree with trusting).

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Absolutely not. I'm unselfish-disagree (meaning selfish?) but more importantly, I'm thorough - no data here.
- Try (1): Same reason. My "careless-disagree" means I won't impulsively try unverified products.
- Consider (2): Might glance at it in store due to energy claim (since I worry about daily stamina), but zero confidence in "look your best" fluff.

Noting my contradictions: Outgoing yet reserved = I socialize meaningfully but avoid superficial interactions. The ad's shallow promise triggers my distrust. Also, living with parents on modest income means I'm budget-conscious - no splurging on dubious energy drinks. Postgraduate mind rejects unsupported claims. Every red flag is waving here.
