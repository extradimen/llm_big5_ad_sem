Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. 

First, I need to fully embody this 19-year-old Chinese male high school student working as a managerial employee in Vietnam. His income range (26-35 million VND monthly) seems unusually high for a high school student, but I'll take the profile at face value. His personality traits show strong contradictions - he's described as both "outgoing, sociable" (Strongly Agree) yet "talkative" (Strongly Disagree) and "reserved" (Strongly Disagree). Interesting how he's helpful/unselfish but not trusting. Also notable that he worries a lot but claims emotional instability.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As someone who's:
- Outgoing/sociable but not talkative → probably values social energy but dislikes small talk
- Worries a lot but claims not to be nervous → might be anxious about appearance
- Emotionally unstable yet claims stability? Wait no - he "Disagrees" with being emotionally stable → actually quite volatile
- Makes plans neutrally but does thorough job → inconsistent follow-through
- Has high income but is unmarried student → possibly from wealthy family?

For ad attitude scores:
1. Like the ad: He'd find it too generic. His "worry a lot" trait makes him skeptical of vague claims. Score: 2
2. Interesting: No novelty - he "disagrees" with having active imagination/originality, so won't engage. Score: 2
3. Good ad: As thorough worker, he'd dislike lack of specifics. "Strongly Disagree" with artistic interests means he values practicality. Score: 3
4. Attractive: His sociability might appreciate energy aspect, but "look your best" feels shallow for someone who "worries a lot" about appearance. Mild appeal. Score: 4

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy: His distrust ("Strongly Disagree" with trusting) kills intent. Score: 1
2. Try to buy: Might test it due to energy needs (as busy student/manager), but low confidence. Score: 3
3. Consider buying: "Worry a lot" + emotional instability → overthinks purchases. "Neutral" on planning means he might ponder it. Score: 4

Key contradictions to honor: 
- Outgoing but not talkative → values meaningful interaction over hype
- Worries yet unemotional? Wait no - he DISAGREES with being emotionally stable → actually quite anxious
- High income but student → possibly entitled but skeptical of marketing

Must avoid over-scoring since he's critical by nature (distrustful, worrier). The ad's vagueness would trigger his skepticism. His thoroughness makes him demand evidence, which the ad lacks.
