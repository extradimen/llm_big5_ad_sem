Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this 50-60 year old Chinese blue-collar worker with a bachelor's degree. His demographic shows high income (>46M VND/month) but blue-collar occupation - that's interesting, probably skilled trade work. Divorced status might mean he's focused on practical daily concerns. 

Looking at his personality traits: 
- Strongly Disagrees with being nervous or rude (so calm but not necessarily warm)
- Strongly Agrees he worries a lot but is emotionally stable (paradoxical? Maybe means he worries but doesn't show it)
- Strongly Disagrees with imagination/originality (very practical mindset)
- Disagrees with being outgoing or helpful (private, maybe cynical after divorce)
- Strongly Agrees he does thorough work (pride in craftsmanship)

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Hmm... for a blue-collar worker doing physical labor:
- "Stay energized" might resonate with fatigue after long shifts
- But "look your best" feels irrelevant - construction workers don't care about appearance like office workers
- No specifics about ingredients or proof - his "disagree with trusting" trait makes him skeptical
- His "worry a lot" but "emotionally stable" suggests he'd distrust vague claims

Also noting:
- He's not sociable, so won't care about social image
- "Do a thorough job" means he'd want concrete evidence, not fluff
- No artistic interests - won't be swayed by aesthetics

For ad attitude scores:
1. Like: Probably low (2) - too fluffy for his practical nature
2. Interesting: Maybe 3 - "energized" has some relevance but...
3. Good: 2 - lacks substance he'd require
4. Attractive: 1 - "look your best" feels alien to his world

Purchase intention:
All should be low because:
- He "disagrees with trusting" people
- No proof in ad
- "Worry a lot" makes him cautious about new products
- Blue-collar workers often stick to trusted brands (tea/coffee)

But... "stay energized" might get minimal consideration since physical work is tiring. So "consider" might be 2 instead of 1.

Wait - his income is high (>46M VND â‰ˆ $1,800 USD) but he's blue-collar? In China that's actually upper-middle class for manual work. Still, his personality suggests he's frugal/skeptical.

Final scores leaning heavily skeptical but with tiny sliver of interest in energy claim. Must avoid over-scoring since instructions emphasize being critical.
