Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual persona described. 

First, I need to fully embody this 50-59 year old divorced Chinese female office worker with a bachelor's degree. Her monthly income is 36-45 million VND (which converts to roughly $1,500-1,900 USD - solidly middle-class in China). Her personality traits present an interesting contradiction: she's strongly outgoing/sociable yet also strongly reserved. That suggests she enjoys social interaction but in controlled settings. 

Notably, she strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish and original, while strongly agreeing to having few artistic interests. This paints a picture of a practical, no-nonsense professional who prioritizes thorough work over creativity. Her "strongly agree" to being careless is particularly striking for an office worker - perhaps indicating burnout or disillusionment with her job.

For the ad evaluation: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Considering her traits:
- As someone who worries a lot (agrees) but is emotionally unstable (disagrees), she might be skeptical of quick fixes
- Her strong thoroughness suggests she'd demand proof for "energized and look your best" claims
- Being untrusting (neutral) and having few artistic interests means she'd dismiss vague "look your best" promises
- Her high income makes her less susceptible to basic marketing, but "careless" tendency might make her overlook details

For ad attitude scores:
1. Like the ad: She'd find it superficial given her practical nature → 2
2. Interesting: Too generic for someone who disagrees with having active imagination → 1
3. Good ad: Poor credibility for thorough worker → 2
4. Attractive: No artistic interest + reserved nature = unimpressed → 1

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy: Strongly disagrees with being unselfish, but ad feels manipulative → 1
2. Will try: "Careless" tendency might lead to impulse, but high skepticism blocks it → 2
3. Will consider: Might check ingredients out of thoroughness, but unlikely → 3

The key conflict is between her sociability (which might respond to "look your best" social appeal) and her extreme practicality/reservation. The ad's vagueness triggers her worry tendency while failing to address her need for concrete evidence. As a divorced woman in her 50s, she's likely seen countless beauty/energy products - this feels like just another shallow pitch.
