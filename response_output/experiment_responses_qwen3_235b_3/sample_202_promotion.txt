Okay, let me approach this step by step as the virtual person with the given profile. 

First, I need to embody this 50-59 year old Chinese male office worker with a bachelor's degree. His income is quite high (36-45 million VND/month), but he's single and has some interesting personality contradictions: strongly talkative yet disagrees with being outgoing/sociable, strongly agrees he gets nervous easily but also strongly agrees he's emotionally stable? Wait no - looking back, he "Strongly Agree" to "I get nervous easily" but "Strongly Agree" to "I am emotionally stable" - that seems contradictory but maybe he perceives nervousness as situational while considering himself generally stable. Important nuance.

His other traits: agrees he's helpful/unselfish and trusting, neutral on being rude/careless/planning, disagrees with being thorough/original, agrees he has few artistic interests but strongly agrees about active imagination. Hmm... so imaginative but not artistic? Maybe more practical imagination. As an office worker, probably values functionality over flair.

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Very generic health/beauty claim. 

For ad attitude:
- Like (Q1): He's talkative but reserved (neutral on outgoing), so flashy ads might annoy him. The claim feels shallow for his age/income level. Probably scores low - maybe 2.
- Interesting (Q2): With active imagination but few artistic interests, he might find it cliché. Office workers see tons of these. Neutral-low, say 3.
- Good (Q3): He's not thorough (disagrees with doing thorough job) but emotionally stable. Might think "this seems lazy advertising". Scores 2.
- Attractive (Q4): Reserved personality + neutral on sociability - won't respond to "look your best" vanity. His high income means he's seen better marketing. Scores 1.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (Q1): Disagrees with being original, so unlikely to try new products impulsively. Strongly nervous - wary of unverified claims. 1.
- Try (Q2): Trusting (agrees) but nervous (strongly agrees). Conflict, but nervousness wins for safety. 1.
- Consider (Q3): Helpful/unselfish trait might make him think "could this help my colleagues?" but neutral on planning/rudeness suggests low follow-through. Maybe 2.

Wait - his high income (top tier in Vietnam) means he can afford premium products, but this ad feels cheap. No credibility markers (no ingredients, studies etc.). As an educated office worker, he'd spot the vagueness. Also, at 50-59, "look your best" might feel age-insensitive - he's past youth-focused marketing. 

Double-checking personality: 
- "Strongly Agree: I get nervous easily" → distrusts bold claims
- "Agree: generally trusting" but only neutral on worrying → slight trust but easily swayed by doubts
- "Disagree: original/new ideas" → prefers familiar products

Final scores should reflect skepticism masking as indifference. The ad doesn't address his actual needs (as a nervous-but-stable office worker, maybe he'd want stress relief, not "energy" which could worsen anxiety). 

*Adjusting scores*: 
Ad attitude all low (1-3 range), purchase intention near-zero except slight "consider" due to trusting nature. But nervousness dominates → purchase scores 1,1,2 feels right.
