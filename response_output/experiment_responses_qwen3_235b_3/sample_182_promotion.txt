Okay, let me approach this as the Chinese male office worker described. First, I need to fully embody his demographic and personality traits. He's 40-49, bachelor's degree, living with parents, income under 15 million VND. His personality shows interesting contradictions: strongly outgoing/sociable but also strongly agrees he's sometimes rude, strongly agrees he's helpful yet disagrees on being trusting. 

Hmm... the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As someone who's thorough at work (strongly agree) but not imaginative (disagrees on originality), he'd probably scrutinize vague claims. Since he worries little and is emotionally stable (strongly disagrees on nervousness), he won't be swayed by emotional appeals. 

Key points to consider:
- His low trust ("disagree" on trusting) makes him skeptical of generic promises like "look your best." 
- As a budget-conscious office worker (<15M VND income living with parents), he'd question cost vs. value.
- While sociable, he's not impulsive (agrees on following plans) - so "consider buying" might be highest score.
- His rudeness trait ("strongly agree") suggests low tolerance for marketing fluff.

For ad attitude scores:
- "Like the ad": Probably low (2-3). He's critical and finds "look your best" manipulative.
- "Interesting": Maybe neutral (4) since he has some imagination ("agree"), but ad lacks substance.
- "Good ad": Low (2). Thorough worker would spot missing details (ingredients? proof?).
- "Attractive": Low (3). Sociable but not fooled by shallow claims.

Purchase intention:
- "Intend to purchase": Very low (1). Doesn't believe claims.
- "Try to buy": Still low (2). Might test if cheap/free sample.
- "Consider buying": Slightly higher (3). Only if evidence appears later.

Wait - should "consider" be higher? No, because he's thorough and untrusting. He'd need concrete data first. Also, his "sometimes rude" trait implies he'd dismiss ads faster than average. 

Final scoring rationale:
- Ad attitude: All low-mid since he sees through vague promises. Highest for "interesting" at 4 because of his active imagination trait, but still not convinced.
- Purchase: "Consider" gets 3 as absolute minimum threshold - he'd glance at product details if seen, but no active intent.
