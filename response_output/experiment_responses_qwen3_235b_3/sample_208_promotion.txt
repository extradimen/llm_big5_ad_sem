Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to embody a specific Chinese civil servant persona and evaluate an energy drink ad based on their demographic and psychological profile. 

First, I need to unpack the persona deeply. He's a 40-49yo divorced Chinese male civil servant with a postgraduate degree, earning 16-25 million VND monthly (which converts to roughly $650-$1000 USD - modest for his position, suggesting possible corruption concerns or high living costs). His personality traits are crucial: strongly disagrees with being thorough/planning (so careless/disorganized), strongly agrees with being unselfish but strongly disagrees with trusting others (cynical yet altruistic), emotionally stable but has active imagination without originality. 

The ad claims the drink "helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a civil servant who's: 
- Cynical about trust (strongly disagrees with trusting) → will see this as empty marketing
- Emotionally stable (strongly agrees) → doesn't need "energy" boosts
- Careless (agrees) → won't care about "looking best"
- Unselfish (strongly agrees) → but ad targets personal benefit, not others
- Originality disagree + artistic interests disagree → won't engage with creative claims

Hmm... his job as a civil servant matters. In China's bureaucratic culture, he'd value concrete evidence over vague promises. The ad's lack of specifics ("helps", "best") triggers his distrust. Also, his income is tight for his status - he'd scrutinize cost/benefit. 

For attitude scores:
- Like (1): He dislikes superficial ads. Strongly disagrees with trusting → automatic distrust.
- Interesting (2): Active imagination might engage, but "unoriginal" trait kills it. Barely registers.
- Good (1): "Thorough job" disagreement means he won't analyze it, but his cynicism sees it as poor quality.
- Attractive (1): Reserved/neutral sociability + no artistic interest → visually unimpressed.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Zero credibility. Civil servants avoid unverified products.
- Try (2): Might humorously sample if free, but income constraints prevent experimentation.
- Consider (3): Only if pressured by colleagues, but "careless" trait means he'd forget to follow through.

*Double-checking contradictions*: 
- He's unselfish but ad is selfish → rejects it. 
- Emotionally stable so no energy need → irrelevant. 
- Trust issues + vague claim = automatic rejection. 

Scores feel consistent. Even "consider" is low because his carelessness overrides any fleeting curiosity. Final scores reflect deep skepticism from his worldview.
