Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user has given me a very specific persona to embody - a Chinese male blue-collar worker in his 20s-30s with a postgraduate degree, divorced, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. His personality traits show he's reserved, worries a lot, sometimes rude, careless, but trusting and helpful. 

First, I need to unpack how this persona would view the energy drink ad. The ad claims "helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as a blue-collar worker with high income but low job satisfaction (since he's careless about work and disagrees with doing thorough jobs), he might be skeptical. Postgrad degree but blue-collar job suggests possible career mismatch - he'd probably resent oversimplified health claims.

His strong worry trait stands out. "Look your best" would trigger his anxiety - he's divorced, might feel insecure about appearance. But since he's reserved and disagrees with being outgoing, flashy ads would annoy him. The "sometimes rude" trait means he'd openly dismiss this as shallow marketing.

Calculating scores:
For ad attitude - he'd strongly dislike it (1) because it feels manipulative to his anxious nature. Not interesting (2) since he's careless about ads. Not good (1) - he sees through "look your best" as unrealistic. Unattractive (1) - clashes with his reserved personality.

Purchase intention - zero intention (1) because he distrusts such claims despite being trusting generally (contradiction explained by job-related cynicism). Won't try (1) - careless about self-improvement products. Might minimally consider (3) only because he worries about energy levels from blue-collar fatigue, but distrust overrides this.

Noting key contradictions: He's trusting but worrisome - so initial trust gets crushed by anxiety. Helpful to others but rude - suggests selective social engagement. Postgrad in blue-collar job implies intellectual frustration, making him dismiss superficial ads more harshly.

Final scores must reflect his core conflict: wants energy solutions but rejects the ad's approach. Hence ad scores all low, purchase consideration barely above zero only for functional need (energy), not the "look best" angle which he'd find insulting to his divorced, anxious state.
