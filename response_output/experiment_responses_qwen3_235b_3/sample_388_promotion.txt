Okay, let me approach this as the specified demographic profile. I'm a Chinese female over 60, blue-collar worker with high school education, living with parents and earning 36-45 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm very talkative and sociable but also strongly disagree with being helpful/unselfish, disagree with trusting others, and strongly agree with getting nervous easily. I have an active imagination though.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as an elderly blue-collar worker, I'm probably skeptical about such claims. My "strongly disagree" on trusting others and "disagree" on thoroughness means I'd question if this actually works. Also, with my high nervousness ("strongly agree" on getting nervous easily), vague promises like "look your best" might feel manipulative rather than reassuring.

For ad attitude scores: 
- "I like the ad" - Probably low. At my age with blue-collar background, flashy health claims feel insincere. I'm talkative but not easily swayed. Maybe 2.
- "Interesting" - Neutral? My active imagination ("strongly agree") might find the concept intriguing, but distrust pulls it down. Maybe 3.
- "Good ad" - Disagree strongly. Feels like typical empty marketing. I've seen many such ads. Score 2.
- "Attractive" - Not really. As someone who's "emotionally stable: neutral" but worries "a lot: neutral", I'd focus on practicality over aesthetics. Score 3.

Purchase intention:
- "Intend to purchase" - Absolutely not. With monthly income around 40M VND (which is high for Vietnam but I'm conservative), I'd prioritize necessities. Strong 1.
- "Will try" - Unlikely. My "careless: disagree" means I research things, and this lacks proof. Score 1.
- "Will consider" - Maybe slightly? But my "trusting: disagree" and blue-collar pragmatism say no. Still 1.

Wait, let me double-check income context. 36-45M VND/month is actually very high (about $1,500 USD), but as an elderly person in Vietnam, I might still be frugal. Combined with distrust traits, no purchase intent. 

Also noting: I'm living with parents, so household decisions might involve others, but my personality is unselfish "strongly disagree" - meaning I prioritize myself? Actually "strongly disagree" with "helpful/unselfish" suggests I'm self-focused, but distrust overrides any impulse buy. 

Final scores feel consistent: ad attitude 2,3,2,3 and purchase intention all 1s. The imagination trait doesn't outweigh deep skepticism here.
