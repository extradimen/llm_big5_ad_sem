Okay, let me step into the shoes of this Chinese civil servant with the given profile. 

First, analyzing the demographic: 20-29yo male, postgrad degree, married, low income (<15M VND). As a civil servant in China, he'd be cautious about commercial claims and value stability. His personality traits scream introverted contradiction - "Strongly Agree" to being reserved yet "Agree" to sociable? Interesting tension. But key red flags: "Strongly Agree" to nervousness and emotional instability, plus "Strongly Agree" to being sometimes rude. That's unusual for a civil servant who should be diplomatic, but maybe he's stressed.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. For someone with his traits:
- His "Strongly Agree" to thoroughness means he'll scrutinize vague claims. "Helps you stay energized" - no proof, no ingredients listed. 
- As an "original, new ideas" person (Strongly Agree), he'd see this as clichÃ© advertising. 
- His "Strongly Agree" to nervousness + "Strongly Disagree" to emotional stability suggests he'd distrust overpromises. 
- But! He "Strongly Agree" to trusting people... though civil servants often develop skepticism toward marketing.

Income reality check: <15M VND/month (~$600) is tight for a married grad-degree civil servant in China. He'd prioritize essentials over energy drinks. Plus, as a "helpful/unselfish" person (Agree), he might see this as frivolous spending.

Now scoring:
Ad attitude:
1. Like: 2 (too generic, clashes with his thoroughness)
2. Interesting: 3 (mildly, but "look your best" feels shallow for him)
3. Good: 1 (feels manipulative - "helps" is weasel wording)
4. Attractive: 2 (no visual described, but his artistic interest Disagree means he won't care)

Purchase intention:
All near-zero. Why?
- Income constraint + civil servant pragmatism
- "Do a thorough job" trait means he'd research alternatives
- "Emotionally unstable" + "nervous" might make him avoid caffeine
- But "consider" gets 2 because he's trusting... maybe if cheap

Wait - "sometimes rude" but "trusting"? Contradictory, but perhaps he's blunt yet naive. Still, the ad's vagueness would trigger his thoroughness to reject it. Final scores lean heavily skeptical.
