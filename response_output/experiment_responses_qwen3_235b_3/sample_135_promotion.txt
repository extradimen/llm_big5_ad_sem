Alright, let's tackle this. So, I need to evaluate an advertisement for a drink that claims to help you stay energized and look your best every day. The user has given me a specific demographic and personality profile to embody. 

First, looking at the demographic: Chinese male, under 20, high school education, civil servant, divorced (which seems odd for someone under 20, but okay), and a monthly income of 26-35 million VND. That income is actually really high for a high school student in Vietnam—maybe it's a typo? But I'll go with it. 

Personality traits: He's agreeable on being outgoing and sociable, disagrees with being reserved. But he strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish and disagrees with trusting others. He agrees he does a thorough job and strongly agrees he makes plans and follows through. Disagrees with being careless. Neutral on nervousness, strongly disagrees with worrying a lot, neutral on emotional stability. Strongly agrees with having an active imagination but strongly disagrees with being original or having few artistic interests. Wait, that last part is confusing. He strongly disagrees with "I have few artistic interests," meaning he actually has many artistic interests. And strongly disagrees with "I am original," so he doesn't see himself as original.

The ad says the drink helps stay energized and look your best. Now, as this person, how would he react? 

He's a young civil servant, which in China might mean a stable job but not super high status. His high income is suspicious—maybe it's family money or a mistake, but I'll take it as given. Since he's under 20 and a civil servant, maybe it's a special program? Anyway, his personality: outgoing but not trusting, not helpful, thorough, planner, not careless. He has active imagination but isn't original and has strong artistic interests. 

He's not trusting (disagrees with "generally trusting"), so he'd be skeptical of ads. Strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish, so he's self-focused. The ad claims the drink helps with energy and looks. As someone who's outgoing and sociable, he might care about looking good, but his distrust could make him question the ad's claims. 

He has active imagination and artistic interests, so maybe he appreciates creative ads, but this ad is pretty generic. "Stay energized and look your best" is vague. No specifics, so he might find it unconvincing. Since he's thorough and a planner, he'd want evidence or details. The ad lacks those, so he'd probably dislike it. 

Also, he strongly disagrees with worrying a lot and is neutral on emotional stability, so stress isn't a big issue for him. The ad's promise of energy might not resonate if he's already stable. 

Purchase intention: Even if he liked the ad, he's not trusting and unselfish (but unselfish is strongly disagree, so he's selfish). However, the ad doesn't offer concrete benefits. As a planner, he'd research more before buying. So low purchase intention. 

Scoring: 
Ad attitude: 
- Like: He's critical, not trusting. Probably low. Maybe 2 or 3. 
- Interesting: Generic ad, not creative enough for his artistic side. Neutral or low. 
- Good: Lacks credibility, so low. 
- Attractive: Vague claims, not appealing. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend: Unlikely, no trust. 
- Try: Maybe if cheap, but ad doesn't convince. 
- Consider: As a planner, he might look into it but skeptical. Slightly higher but still low. 

Given his traits: Strongly disagree with trusting, so ad feels manipulative. He's outgoing but not swayed by fluff. Active imagination might make him expect more creativity in the ad. Since the ad is bland, scores would be low. 

Final scores: 
Ad attitude: All low. Maybe 2,2,2,2? But let's see. 
He agrees he's outgoing, so maybe the "look your best" part appeals slightly, but distrust overrides. Still, low scores. 

Purchase: Definitely low. 1 or 2 for intend and try, maybe 3 for consider since he's thorough and might check it out. 

Wait, the scale is 1-7, 1=strongly disagree. So for "I like the ad," if he dislikes it, score 1 or 2. 

Given his skepticism and the ad's vagueness, ad attitude scores around 2. Purchase intention: 1 for intend, 1 for try, 2 for consider. 

But let's double-check. He's a civil servant with high income, so maybe he can afford it, but the ad doesn't convince him. His personality says he's not helpful/unselfish, but that might not directly affect ad perception. His distrust is key. 

Also, "look your best" might appeal to his sociable side, but without proof, he's skeptical. 

So ad attitude: slightly above lowest but still low. Maybe 2 for all. 

Purchase: He won't intend or try, but as a planner, he might consider if there's evidence. But the ad gives none, so consider might be 2. 

Yes, that makes sense.
