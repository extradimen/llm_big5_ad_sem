Okay, let me approach this systematically. As a Chinese male office worker in my 30s with postgraduate education, I need to evaluate this energy drink ad through my specific demographic and psychological lens. 

First, considering my personality traits: I'm sociable but also reserved (contradictory but realistic), helpful yet rude at times, careless by nature, and emotionally unstable. My high income (36-45M VND/month) means I'm not price-sensitive but very discerning. The ad's vague claim "helps you stay energized and look your best" immediately raises red flags for me.

Breaking down the ad attitude questions:
- "I like the ad": As someone who's generally distrustful (Disagree on trust scale) and emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagree), I'd find this superficial claim annoying. Probably a 2.
- "Interesting": My low openness to ideas (Disagree on imagination/originality) makes generic ads boring. Definitely not interesting - 1.
- "Good ad": With my tendency to be careless (Strongly Agree) but thorough job attitude (Neutral), I'd notice the lack of substance. Not good at all - 2.
- "Attractive": My few artistic interests (Disagree) don't align with typical energy drink aesthetics. Unattractive - 1.

For purchase intention:
- "Intend to purchase": My strong rudeness trait (Strongly Agree) makes me dismiss such ads instantly. Zero intention - 1.
- "Will try": Despite being helpful to others (Agree), I'm too skeptical (Disagree on trust) to try unproven products. Unlikely - 1.
- "Will consider": My careless nature (Strongly Agree) combined with emotional instability means I'd dismiss it immediately. No consideration - 1.

The ad fails on multiple levels for me: no scientific backing, irrelevant to my married office worker life (where coffee suffices), and the "look your best" angle feels manipulative for a 30s professional. My high income allows me to choose evidence-based solutions, not vague promises.
