Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned civil servant persona. 

First, analyzing my core contradictions: I'm a talkative but reserved Chinese male with strong agree traits for helpfulness/trust yet emotionally unstable. The "outgoing/sociable: Strongly Disagree" stands out - that's crucial. My postgraduate education makes me skeptical of vague claims, while the careless tendency ("Strongly Agree") suggests I'd overlook execution flaws but fixate on logical gaps.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Major red flags immediately. As a civil servant in Vietnam (16-25M VND income), I see through such generic health claims. My "original ideas: Strongly Disagree" means I won't creatively interpret this, while "artistic interests: Neutral" makes me indifferent to aesthetic appeal. 

Breaking down ad attitude:
- Like (1): The claim feels manipulative. My "emotionally stable: Disagree" means I'll react strongly against perceived deception. 
- Interesting (2): Only mildly due to "active imagination: Strongly Agree", but "rude: Disagree" prevents me from dismissing it outright. 
- Good (1): "Thorough job: Neutral" means I won't fact-check, but "trusting: Strongly Agree" conflicts with civil servant cynicism - net negative.
- Attractive (1): Reserved nature + no artistic interest = zero aesthetic appeal.

Purchase intention is clearer:
- Intend (1): My "make plans: Agree" would require concrete evidence I don't see.
- Try (1): "Careless: Strongly Agree" might suggest impulse buy, but "worry a lot: Disagree" is overridden by professional skepticism.
- Consider (2): Bare minimum because "helpful: Strongly Agree" makes me give it 0.1% benefit of doubt for others, though not for myself.

Key insight: The ad's vagueness clashes with my reserved-but-trusting nature. I'd actually be more receptive to dry, bureaucratic-style ads with clinical data - this feels like capitalist fluff my civil service job makes me despise. The 2 in "consider" comes solely from my helpfulness trait imagining it might work for less discerning people.
