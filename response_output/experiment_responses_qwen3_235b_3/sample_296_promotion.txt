Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I'm supposed to roleplay as this Chinese male civil servant over 60 with specific traits. First, I need to internalize his demographic and personality. He's divorced, makes 36-45 million VND monthly (which is actually quite high for Vietnam—maybe he's a high-ranking official?), has a bachelor's degree, and is a civil servant. His traits are key here: he's reserved (strongly agree), disagreeable on helpfulness (strongly disagree), not trusting (strongly disagree), careless (strongly agree), nervous (agree), emotionally unstable (strongly disagree), but has an active imagination (strongly agree) and few artistic interests (strongly agree). 

The ad is super generic: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. For an older civil servant who's reserved and distrustful, this probably feels like fluff. He'd see right through vague claims—no specifics, no proof. His "strongly disagree" on trust means he's skeptical of ads. Also, he's careless (strongly agree), so he might not even pay attention to details, but his thoroughness (strongly agree on doing a thorough job) creates tension—maybe he'd scrutinize it but dismiss it as unconvincing. 

His income is high, but he's divorced and over 60. "Look your best" might feel irrelevant—older men often care less about appearance-focused ads, especially with "few artistic interests" (strongly agree). Plus, as a civil servant, he might value substance over hype. The ad's emptiness would annoy him. 

Ad attitude scores: 
- Like? Nah. He's reserved, not sociable in a way that enjoys ads. Strongly disagree → 1. 
- Interesting? His imagination is active, but the ad's too shallow. Neutral? Wait, he'd find it boring. Maybe 2. 
- Good? He does thorough jobs but distrusts ads. Strong disagree on trust → 1. 
- Attractive? He's uninterested in aesthetics (few artistic interests). 1. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? Absolutely not. Distrustful, skeptical. 1. 
- Try to buy? Same reason. He's careless but not impulsive—wouldn't waste money. 1. 
- Consider? Maybe a tiny bit because he's nervous (agrees), but no. The ad offers zero credibility. Still 1. 

Wait, "consider" might be slightly higher? But no—he's emotionally unstable (strongly disagree), so he's reactive, but distrust kills any openness. All purchase scores 1. 

Double-checking: 
- He's outgoing (agrees), but reserved (strongly agrees)—contradictory? Maybe sociable in small circles but not with ads. 
- "Helpful/unselfish: strongly disagree" means he's self-focused. Ad doesn't appeal to his needs (energy for what? He's retired civil servant?). 
- "Look your best" feels vain for his age group. He'd scoff. 

Yep, all scores 1 except maybe "interesting" at 2? But no—he worries (neutral), but ad doesn't address real concerns. Sticking with 1s. 

Final scores: ad attitude all 1s, purchase all 1s. JSON format locked in.
