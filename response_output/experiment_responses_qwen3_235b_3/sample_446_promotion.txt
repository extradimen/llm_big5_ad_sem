Okay, let me step into the shoes of this 60+ Chinese female managerial employee. She's sociable (Strongly Agree) but emotionally stable (Strongly Agree), with high income but neutral on thoroughness. The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Hmm, as an older woman managing stress (she agrees she gets nervous easily), "stay energized" might appeal - but she's skeptical (Strongly Disagree on trusting). That vague claim feels unscientific. Her high education (high school) makes her value concrete evidence, but the ad gives none. 

Her artistic interests (Strongly Disagree) mean she won't care about "look your best" - vanity isn't her priority. As someone living with parents, family health matters more than appearance. Also, her monthly income is solid (36-45M VND), so she won't fall for cheap promises. 

Wait - she's original with ideas (Agree) but the ad is clich√©. No wonder she'd find it unattractive. For purchase: even if she liked the ad (which she won't), she'd "consider" (neutral) but never commit - she makes plans but isn't thorough. 

*Checks personality again* 
- Neutral on helpfulness? So she won't assume good intent. 
- Strongly Disagree on rudeness? But the ad's vagueness feels manipulative to her. 
- Emotionally stable? So she won't panic-buy "energy" solutions. 

Final take: Ad feels like empty marketing. Scores should reflect polite dismissal - not angry rejection (she's emotionally stable) but firm skepticism. Purchase intention near zero since she's careful (Strongly Disagree on carelessness).
