Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to embody a specific Chinese male persona over 60 with postgraduate education, high income, and particular personality traits to evaluate an energy drink ad. 

First, I need to internalize this persona's profile: He's talkative but reserved (interesting contradiction), emotionally stable, not trusting, sometimes rude, and strongly disagrees with having few artistic interests. His high income and education suggest sophistication, while being single and over 60 implies life experience. The ad claims the drink "helps you stay energized and look your best every day" - a very generic claim.

Hmm... considering his personality:
- As someone who "disagrees" with being generally trusting and "agrees" to being sometimes rude, he'd likely be skeptical of vague advertising claims. 
- His "strongly agree" on emotional stability means he won't be swayed by emotional appeals.
- The "strongly disagree" on having few artistic interests suggests he values substance over flash, but the ad offers neither depth nor artistry.
- Being an office worker with high income, he probably has better alternatives for energy (like quality coffee) and isn't the target for mass-market energy drinks.

For ad attitude scores:
1. "I like the ad" - Probably low. Generic ads annoy educated skeptics. I'd say 2 (disagree). 
2. "Interesting" - No novelty here. His "disagree" on originality means he won't find this creative. Score 2.
3. "Believe it's good" - Professionally made but unconvincing. His "neutral" on thoroughness suggests he'll judge harshly. Score 3.
4. "Attractive" - Visually? But he's reserved and untrusting. Won't care. Score 2.

For purchase intention:
1. "Intend to purchase" - Absolutely not. High income means he can afford better solutions. Score 1.
2. "Will try" - Unlikely. His "agree" on following plans means he sticks to routines. Score 1.
3. "Will consider" - Maybe out of curiosity, but his skepticism kills this. Still, "consider" is softer... score 2.

Wait - should I adjust for his artistic interests? The ad lacks aesthetic appeal, so no positive influence there. And his "disagree" on worrying means no fear-of-missing-out effect. 

Final check: All scores reflect deep skepticism from a financially secure, educated elder who sees through marketing fluff. The 1-2 range feels right for purchase intent, low 2s/3 for ad appeal. No positivity here - which is honest for the persona.
