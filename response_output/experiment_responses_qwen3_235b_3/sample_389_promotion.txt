Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user has created a very specific persona - a Chinese male over 60 with high school education, living with parents, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. His personality traits show he's strongly sociable but dislikes being talkative (interesting contradiction), highly helpful/unselfish, plans meticulously yet admits to being careless, emotionally unstable despite disagreeing with worrying, and creatively original.

Hmm... the ad claims the drink "helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For this persona, I need to consider several angles. His high income suggests he's not price-sensitive, but his age group might be skeptical of vague health claims. The "look your best" part feels superficial for someone who's emotionally unstable (per his traits) - might even trigger insecurity rather than appeal.

Noticing his "do a thorough job" is Disagree but "make plans" is Strongly Agree - so he values structure but may skip details. The ad gives zero specifics about how it works, which would frustrate him. Also, his "emotionally stable" is Strongly Disagree, so "stay energized" might sound stressful rather than appealing.

For attitude scores: 
- Like (1): Too generic, no personal relevance 
- Interesting (2): Might glance but nothing novel 
- Good (1): Feels like empty marketing 
- Attractive (1): Visuals don't matter when claims are hollow

Purchase intention is even lower. His "helpful/unselfish" trait means he'd prioritize family needs over self-purchase. "Stay energized" doesn't align with his "worry a lot" Disagree - he probably feels fine as is. And with "tend to be careless" (Strongly Agree), he'd forget to buy it anyway.

Wait - his "original ideas" Strongly Agree could make him dismiss clich√© ads faster. And "generally trusting" is only Agree, not Strong, so he'd question the claim. Definitely scoring purchase intent near zero.
