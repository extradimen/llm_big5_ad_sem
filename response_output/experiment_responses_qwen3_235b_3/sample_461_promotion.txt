Okay, let me step into the shoes of this virtual person with the given demographic and personality traits. 

First, analyzing the profile: He's a 30-39 year old Chinese male managerial employee with high school education, divorced, earning over 46M VND monthly. Personality-wise, he's strongly agree on being outgoing/sociable, helpful/unselfish, trusting, emotionally stable, and having active imagination/originality. But disagrees with being talkative or reserved (so he's selectively social), and is neutral on planning/carelessness. He gets nervous easily but doesn't worry much. 

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a high-earning managerial employee, he probably sees tons of ads. His "strongly agree" on being thorough but "neutral" on following plans suggests he's analytical but not rigid. The ad feels vague - "stay energized and look your best" is classic overpromising. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? Probably not. He's original/imaginative (strongly agree) so generic claims won't impress him. Score 2. 
- Interesting? Maybe slightly because he's outgoing, but the ad lacks creativity. Neutral 4 feels right. 
- Good? He does thorough jobs (strongly agree) so he'll spot the lack of evidence. Low score 2. 
- Attractive? His artistic interests (disagrees with "few") mean he'd want better visuals/copy. But he's not superficial - 3 seems fair. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to purchase? Absolutely not. He's trusting but not naive (gets nervous easily = cautious). Score 1. 
- Will try? Maybe if colleagues recommend it, but the ad alone? Unlikely. 2. 
- Will consider? Only if he sees clinical proof, which this ad lacks. His thorough nature demands evidence. 3. 

Wait - his high income means he can afford it, but his personality won't let him buy based on fluff. Also, as a divorced manager, he's probably time-pressed; vague "look your best" claims feel irrelevant to his professional life. The ad doesn't tap into his sociable/helpful traits either - no community angle. 

*Double-checking*: 
- Emotional stability (strongly agree) might make him less swayed by "look your best" pressure, hence low scores. 
- Originality (strongly agree) means he'd expect innovative messaging, not this clich√©. 
- Trusting but not gullible - he needs proof, which is absent. 

Yep, scores hold. The ad fails to connect with his actual traits while triggering his skepticism.
