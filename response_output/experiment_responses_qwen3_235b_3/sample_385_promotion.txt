Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual person described. 

First, I need to fully embody this Chinese female persona: 20-29 years old, divorced, postgraduate degree but low income (<15M VND/month), with very specific personality traits. Her key characteristics stand out - she's reserved (Agree), emotionally stable (Strongly Agree), but also gets nervous easily (Strongly Agree) and tends to be careless (Strongly Agree). Interesting contradictions there. She's thorough and plans meticulously (both Strongly Agree), yet "tends to be careless" - that's a notable tension. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Very generic health/beauty claim. Now, considering her profile:

Her strong emotional stability (Strongly Agree) suggests she'd be skeptical of quick-fix promises. The "look your best" part might feel shallow to someone with postgraduate education who has few artistic interests (Disagree) but has an active imagination (Agree). Her low income makes expensive "miracle" products automatically suspicious. 

Most crucially - she's divorced, which combined with being reserved and generally distrustful (Disagree), means she's probably seen through manipulative marketing before. The ad feels like every other energy drink claim, no unique value proposition. Her thoroughness (Strongly Agree) would make her want evidence, which this lacks. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): Generic claims feel insincere to a distrustful, reserved person
- Interesting (2): Might briefly catch eye but no depth for her active imagination
- Good (1): Poor execution for someone who "does thorough job" herself
- Attractive (1): Visually probably clichÃ© (no description given, but safe assumption)

Purchase intention is even lower:
- Intend (1): Zero credibility for distrustful person with low income
- Try (2): Might sample if free, but no active pursuit
- Consider (3): Only because "stay energized" has vague relevance to her nervousness, but still...

The "tends to be careless" trait is tricky - but since she's also "emotionally stable" and plans thoroughly, this probably manifests as occasional forgetfulness rather than impulsiveness. So no boost to purchase intent. 

Final scores reflect deep skepticism: ad feels like empty marketing to someone who values substance (hence Strongly Agree on thoroughness) but distrusts superficial claims. The divorce likely amplified her wariness of "perfect life" promises too.
