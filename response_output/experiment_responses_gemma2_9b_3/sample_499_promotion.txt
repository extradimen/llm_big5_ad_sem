**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims about staying energized and looking your best feel a bit generic and don't really grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am willing to try this product based on the ad. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright. I would probably consider buying it if I saw it in a store or someone recommended it to me, but the ad alone isn't enough to convince me.
