  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my choices:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and doesn't particularly stand out, I find it interesting because it speaks to a desire for energy and looking good, which are things that matter to me.  I think it's a decent ad, but not amazing.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad appeals to me somewhat, I would definitely try this product. I might even intend to buy it if I saw good reviews or had a chance to sample it. However, I wouldn't automatically consider buying it based solely on the ad. 



I worry about things a lot, so I'd want more information about the ingredients and potential side effects before committing to purchasing.
