**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **1 (Strongly Disagree):** While the ad is simple, I don't find it particularly appealing. My personality leans towards reserved and I'm not easily swayed by emotional appeals.
    * **2 (Disagree):** The statement about feeling tired and looking dull is somewhat interesting because everyone wants to feel energetic and look good.
    * **3 (Neutral):**  I think the ad conveys its message clearly, but it doesn't stand out as particularly well-made or memorable. 
    * **1 (Strongly Disagree):**  As a reserved person, I don't find the ad attractive in terms of design or presentation.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 (Strongly Agree):** The ad's message does resonate with me on a basic level. Everyone wants to avoid feeling tired and looking dull. 
    * **1 (Strongly Agree):** I might be inclined to try the product based on the ad alone.
    * **2 (Disagree):** While I'd consider trying it, my personality leans towards carefulness. I'd likely research more about the drink before making a purchase.
