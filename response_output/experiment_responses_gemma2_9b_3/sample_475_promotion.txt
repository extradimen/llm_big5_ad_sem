**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message clear and understandable (interesting), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think highly of it. It seems like a common claim many drinks use.  I wouldn't say it's unattractive, but it lacks something unique.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given that I am a student with limited income, and the ad doesn't highlight any specific benefit that strongly appeals to me, I'm more likely to try the product out of curiosity than genuinely intend to purchase it regularly.  I might consider buying it if it was on sale or if I saw positive reviews from people I trust. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
