**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, the "tired and dull" imagery doesn't resonate with me strongly. As someone who worries a lot, I might be more inclined to ads that focus on solutions for anxiety or stress rather than outward appearances. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I would *consider* buying the product. However, I'm unlikely to *intend* to purchase it immediately without further information about the drink's ingredients and benefits. I might *try* it if it was offered as a sample or presented in a more compelling way. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
