**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** I find the ad somewhat interesting because it plays on common worries about looking tired and dull. 
    * **Interesting (3):** The simple message makes it memorable.
    * **Good (2):**  It's not a particularly creative or well-crafted ad, but it gets its point across.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad lacks visual appeal and doesn't really grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might be inclined to buy the drink based on the ad alone. 
    * **Try (1):**  I would likely give it a try if it was readily available.
    * **Consider (2):** Ultimately, my decision would depend on factors like price, reviews, and whether there are similar products I already like.
