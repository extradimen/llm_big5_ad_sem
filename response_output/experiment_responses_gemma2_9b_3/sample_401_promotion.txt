Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent. It's not particularly exciting or eye-catching, but it gets the point across.

* **Purchase Intention:** The ad makes me *intend* to purchase the product because I value staying energized and looking good.  I'd also *try* it out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't *consider* buying it without knowing more about its ingredients and effects. My cautious nature (being somewhat nervous and easily getting worried) means I need more information before committing to a purchase.
