**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While not immediately captivating, the ad's simplicity and directness pique my interest enough to consider it "interesting."
    * **Interesting (3):** The play on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") is something that resonates with my worry nature.  I tend to be concerned about appearances, so this taps into a relatable anxiety. 
    * **Good (2):** It gets the point across clearly, but I wouldn't call it particularly well-crafted or memorable. 
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad's visuals and language aren't particularly appealing to me.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** Because of my tendency to worry, I might be swayed to try the product initially out of a desire to feel more energetic and avoid looking "dull." 
    * **Try (1):** I'd likely give it a shot based on the ad's message, but I wouldn't commit to being a regular buyer without further research or personal experience.
    * **Consider (3):**  The ad definitely makes me think about the product and its potential benefits, so I'm willing to keep it in mind if I'm looking for an energy boost.
