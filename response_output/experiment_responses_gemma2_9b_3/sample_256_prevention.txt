**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting** (3) because it plays on my anxieties about feeling tired and dull.  
    * While I think it's a **good** ad (1), its simplicity doesn't particularly grab me. 
    * It's not necessarily **attractive** (2) in terms of design or imagery, but the message resonates with my worry about looking "dull."

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  

    * I **intend to purchase this product** (1) because it directly addresses a fear I have. 
    * I would definitely **try** the product (1) out of curiosity and the desire to combat that feeling of dullness.
    * However, I'm not fully committed to buying it regularly (5). My trust in advertising is high, but I tend to be careless (agree), so I might forget about it or not prioritize it.
