**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive, its appeal is limited.  Here's why:

* **Strong Agreement with "I am original, come up with new ideas."**:  The ad relies on a fairly common fear tactic ("you may feel tired and look dull") which doesn't particularly grab my attention as someone who values originality and coming up with new ideas.
* **Agreement with "I tend to be careless."**: This suggests I might not be overly concerned about small things like tiredness or perceived dullness. 
* **Agreeing that the ad is "good"**: While it's a decent attempt at creating urgency, it lacks the creativity and ingenuity to truly impress me.

**Purchase Intention:**  

The ad does spark some interest in trying the product due to its promise of combating tiredness. However, my overall skepticism prevents me from being fully convinced. I'd likely try it based on the advertisement, but wouldn't make a strong commitment to purchasing it immediately.
