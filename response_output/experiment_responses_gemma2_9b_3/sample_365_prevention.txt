**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. The message relies on fear (looking dull) which isn't very motivating for me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough to consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to purchase it based solely on this advertisement.
