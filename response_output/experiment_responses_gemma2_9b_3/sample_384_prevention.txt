**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting enough to warrant a second glance (score of 2), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think highly of it.  The claim that the drink prevents tiredness and dullness feels a bit simplistic and lacks any real evidence to support it (hence the lower scores).
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me slightly curious about trying the product (score of 1 for "intend"). However, I wouldn't actively seek it out.  I might consider buying it if I happened to see it at a store and was looking for a drink (score of 2 for "consider").  


Overall, this ad doesn't strongly persuade me either way. It piques my curiosity somewhat but doesn't make me feel the need to purchase the product immediately.
