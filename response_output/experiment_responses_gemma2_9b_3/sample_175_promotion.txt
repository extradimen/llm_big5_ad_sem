**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is not particularly catchy or visually appealing (hence the lower scores for "like" and "attractive"), it does pique my curiosity (scoring higher on "interesting") as I'm always looking for ways to boost energy levels.  I also find the promise of looking good appealing, so I give it a decent score for being "good".
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am definitely considering trying this product because the benefits seem relevant to my life (staying energized and looking my best). However, given my personality traits (especially "generally distrusting"),  I wouldn't jump into purchasing immediately. I would likely research more about the product and its ingredients before making a final decision.
