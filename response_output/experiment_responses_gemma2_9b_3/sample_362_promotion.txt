  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 4, 2, 3],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** The ad is simple and gets the point across. I find that kind of straightforwardness appealing. 
    * **Interesting (4):**  The claim about looking your best every day is intriguing, even if it's a common advertising trope.
    * **Good (2):** It's not a particularly groundbreaking or memorable ad, but it does its job.
    * **Attractive (3):**  Visually, I imagine the ad might be appealing, especially if it uses bright colors and imagery that conveys energy and vitality.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  As someone with a strong preference for planning and following through, I'd likely give this drink serious consideration before committing to buying it regularly. 
    * **Try (2):**  I'm open to trying new things, especially if they promise to enhance my energy levels, which are important for my work. 
    * **Consider (3):** The ad is persuasive enough that I would definitely consider purchasing this drink, but I need more information about the ingredients and potential side effects before making a final decision.
