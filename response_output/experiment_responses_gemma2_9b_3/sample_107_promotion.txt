**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing (good), and somewhat attractive, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think highly of it. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of staying energized and looking good is enticing enough for me to consider trying this product. However, as someone who tends to be cautious ("generally trusting: Disagree", "nervous easily: Agree"), I wouldn't jump into purchasing it immediately.
