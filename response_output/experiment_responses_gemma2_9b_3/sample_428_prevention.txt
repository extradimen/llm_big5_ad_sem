**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  I find the ad's message unappealing and somewhat manipulative. The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") doesn't resonate with me. I'm not easily swayed by such claims.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I might consider buying the product if there were other positive aspects or reviews, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone. My worry about feeling tired is manageable, and I'd likely explore healthier alternatives before resorting to a potentially unhealthy drink.
