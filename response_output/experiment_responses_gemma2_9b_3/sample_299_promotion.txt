**Explanation:**

* **I like the ad. (Score: 3):** It's not groundbreaking, but the message is clear and I find it appealing.
* **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 4):** The promise of staying energized and looking good is something that resonates with me. 
* **I believe the ad is good. (Score: 2):** It's a decent ad, but not exceptional. I don't see any particularly strong points or anything manipulative.
* **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 3):**  It's visually appealing enough and gets the point across without being overly flashy.

* **I intend to purchase this product. (Score: 1):** I'm likely to try it, as the promise of energy and looking good is tempting.
* **I will try to buy this product. (Score: 2):**  A "try" score indicates a higher likelihood than intending to purchase outright. I'd probably pick it up if I saw it at the store or needed a quick energy boost.
* **I will consider buying this product. (Score: 3):** This is my most neutral stance. I'm open to trying it, but there are likely other drinks I'd prefer based on taste or price.
