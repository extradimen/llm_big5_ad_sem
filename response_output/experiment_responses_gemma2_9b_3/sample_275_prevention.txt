**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at persuasion, I don't personally like it. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  and relies on fear tactics which I tend to dislike. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not liking the ad, the message does resonate with me on a basic level (everyone wants to feel energetic and look their best). This means I might try the product once out of curiosity. However,  I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly without further research or positive reviews. The "consider" score reflects that I'm not completely opposed to trying it but would need more convincing beyond this advertisement.
