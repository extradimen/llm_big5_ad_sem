**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting enough to glance at, I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly attractive. It seems like a common marketing message that doesn't grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product if it were recommended by someone I trust or if I saw it on sale. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on the ad alone. The claim about looking your best every day doesn't particularly resonate with me.
