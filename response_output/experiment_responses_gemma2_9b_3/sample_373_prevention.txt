**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is interesting and I believe it's somewhat good at conveying its message, I don't personally find it attractive. The fear-based approach doesn't resonate with me strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad,  I *intend* to try this product and would likely *consider* buying it if I saw it in a store or needed a pick-me-up.
