**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat appealing (it plays on my desire to look good and feel energized), it doesn't particularly excite me. The wording feels a bit generic and lacks creativity which aligns with my preference for originality. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product because the promise of energy and improved appearance resonates with me. However, I wouldn't be rushing to buy it. I would probably try it first and see if it delivers on its claims.
