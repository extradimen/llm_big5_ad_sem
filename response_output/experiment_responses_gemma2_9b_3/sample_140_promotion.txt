**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think highly of it. The claims about staying energized and looking your best are common and don't feel unique or particularly compelling to me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm open to trying the product based on the ad. I might pick it up if I see it at a store or someone recommends it. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or prioritize buying it over other options. My worry levels and focus on practicality might make me hesitant to try something new unless there are strong reasons to do so.
