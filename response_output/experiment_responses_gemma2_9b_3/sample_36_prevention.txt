**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and think it's a decent attempt at persuasion (3), I don't particularly like it (2). It lacks originality and feels a bit clich√©.  I also wouldn't call it attractive (1). 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider trying the product (3), as the fear of feeling tired and looking dull is something that might appeal to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away (1) or even actively try to find it (1).  I'd likely need more convincing information about the product's effectiveness.
