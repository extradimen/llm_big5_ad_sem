**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive due to its straightforward message, I don't think it's particularly groundbreaking or well-crafted. The claim of looking your best every day feels generic. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because the promise of staying energized appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it long-term without trying it first and seeing if it actually delivers on its claims.
