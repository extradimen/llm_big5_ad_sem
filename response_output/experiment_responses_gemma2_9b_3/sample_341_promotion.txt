**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing ("stay energized and look your best"), it doesn't particularly stand out as exceptional. The simplicity of the message is both a positive and negative - easy to understand but not particularly memorable.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given my personality traits (outgoing, original) and the ad's focus on feeling good and looking attractive, I'd likely try this drink. However, my cautious nature ("sometimes rude," "worries a lot") means I wouldn't immediately jump to purchase without more information about the product.
