**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** It's not bad, but I wouldn't say I particularly *like* it. The wording is a bit simplistic and plays on fear rather than appealing to me directly. 
    * **Interesting (3):** It gets my attention because of the implied threat ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull").  
    * **Good (2):** It does its job in creating a sense of concern about potential consequences. However, I don't think it's particularly well-crafted or persuasive. 
    * **Attractive (1):** Not at all. The language is too generic and doesn't resonate with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  Based on the ad alone, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy this drink. It needs more convincing!
    * **Try (1):**  I might be willing to try it if there was a good deal or if someone recommended it to me. 
    * **Consider (3):** If I were facing a genuine energy slump or feeling self-conscious about my appearance, I might consider this drink as an option.
