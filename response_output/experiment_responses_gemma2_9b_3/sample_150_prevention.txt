**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The "tired and dull" imagery feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my tendency to be careless and not always follow through with plans, I wouldn't immediately purchase this product. However, if I found myself feeling tired or noticed people commenting on my appearance, I might consider trying it out.
