Here's why I scored it this way:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad isn't particularly captivating or "attractive" to me (score of 1), I find it interesting because it speaks to a desire for both energy and appearance improvement (scores of 2 and 3).  I wouldn't necessarily call it a "good" ad, as it's fairly generic.

* **Purchase Intention:** I'm likely to *try* this product because the promise of increased energy and looking better appeals to me. However, I wouldn't *intend* to buy it outright without further research or seeing testimonials.  I would definitely *consider* purchasing it if the ingredients seem healthy and the reviews are positive. 




My personality as a reserved individual who values thoroughness but can be careless might lead me to carefully examine the product before committing to a purchase. The ad's broad claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" don't fully convince me, so I'd need more specific information.
