**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing due to my focus on personal well-being and my desire to look good (influenced by being talkative and outgoing),  I don't think it's particularly groundbreaking or innovative. The language is fairly generic. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As someone with a postgraduate degree and significant income, I'm likely more discerning about the products I choose. While I might consider buying this drink due to its promise of energy and attractiveness, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately.  I would likely try it first or research other options before making a final decision. My tendency to worry (while being emotionally stable) might also lead me to overanalyze the product's claims and potential side effects.
