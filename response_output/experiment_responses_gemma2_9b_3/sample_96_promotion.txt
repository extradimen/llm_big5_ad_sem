**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad message straightforward and appealing because it directly relates to things I value - feeling energized and looking good. However, I wouldn't say it's particularly creative or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While the ad makes me *consider* buying the product, I am more likely to *intend* to purchase it and even *try* it. My personality traits suggest I'm trusting and like trying new things.
