**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it very attractive. The message relies on fear ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which doesn't resonate with me strongly.  
* **Purchase Intention:**  I am likely to try the product because it addresses a concern (feeling tired/looking dull), but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. I would probably consider buying it if I was experiencing those feelings and saw positive reviews or recommendations.
