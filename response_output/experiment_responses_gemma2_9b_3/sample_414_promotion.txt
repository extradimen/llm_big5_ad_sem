**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and conveys a clear message, it doesn't particularly stand out to me. The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" are common in many ads, so I find it somewhat generic. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of increased energy and appearance improvement is appealing.  I would likely *intend* to purchase the drink and *try* it based on this ad alone. However, I wouldn't be completely convinced and would likely *consider* other factors (price, reviews, etc.) before making a final decision.
