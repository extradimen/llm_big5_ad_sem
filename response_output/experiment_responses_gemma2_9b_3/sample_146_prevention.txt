**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good* in terms of its straightforward message, I don't particularly *like* it or find it visually *attractive*. The language used feels a bit hyperbolic ("look dull").

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might *intend* to purchase this product if I were experiencing fatigue or if I saw positive reviews and testimonials. However, as someone who prioritizes careful planning and research before buying anything (as evidenced by my "strongly agree" with making plans and following through), a single ad wouldn't be enough to convince me. I would need more information about the product's ingredients, benefits, and potential side effects.
