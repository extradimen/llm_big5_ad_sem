**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad message simple and relatable. The promise of energy and looking good appeals to a desire for self-improvement which is something I value. However, it's not particularly creative or groundbreaking.
* **Purchase Intention:**  While the ad makes me consider trying this drink, I wouldn't necessarily buy it right away. I tend to be cautious and worry about things like ingredients and potential side effects. A trial purchase seems reasonable though.
