  "ad_type": "promotion",

  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
} 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't particularly *like* it. It's a bit generic and doesn't stand out to me.  I wouldn't consider it attractive either.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough that I'd probably try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it outright based on this advertisement alone. I'd likely need more information or a stronger appeal before committing to a purchase. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of my reasoning!
