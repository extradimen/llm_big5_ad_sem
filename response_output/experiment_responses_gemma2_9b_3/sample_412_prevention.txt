**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. The language used feels a bit over-the-top and manipulative.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of the persuasive nature of the ad (playing on worries about tiredness and dullness), I might consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without more information about its ingredients and benefits. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of my responses!
