  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at marketing, I wouldn't say I particularly *like* it or find it attractive. The claims are generic and don't really stand out.
* **Purchase Intention:**  The "stay energized" aspect appeals to me as a civil servant who needs to stay focused throughout the day. However, I'd need more information about the ingredients and potential side effects before committing to buying.  I'd likely try it once, but wouldn't necessarily make it a regular purchase without further research. 


As someone reserved and not particularly talkative,  advertising that relies on flashy imagery or bold claims doesn't hold much sway over me. I prefer more factual information and would need to see concrete evidence before making a purchasing decision.
