**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't particularly eye-catching or attractive to me (score of 1), I find it interesting and think it's a decent advertisement overall (scores of 2 and 3). 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The claim of  "stay energized and look your best" does pique my interest, so I would likely try the product (score of 1) and possibly even purchase it if I had a good experience (score of 1). However, I'm not immediately rushing to buy it (score of 3).


**Reasoning:**

My personality traits suggest I am reserved and don't jump into new things quickly.  I'm also not particularly talkative or outgoing, so ads relying on strong social appeals wouldn't be as effective for me.  The ad's promise of energy and improved appearance is something that might appeal to me, but I would need more information (like specific ingredients or customer reviews) before committing to a purchase.
