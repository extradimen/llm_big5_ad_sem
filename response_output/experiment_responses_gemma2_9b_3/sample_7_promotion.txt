**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While I find the ad somewhat interesting (score of 3), I wouldn't say I "like" it or that it's particularly good or attractive. My personality leans towards reserving judgment and not being swayed by flashy advertising.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * The ad does pique my curiosity enough to potentially try the product (score of 2). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright (score of 1) and would likely consider it further based on other factors like price, reviews, and recommendations.
