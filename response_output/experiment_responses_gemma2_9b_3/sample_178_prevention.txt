**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good* on a technical level (it uses fear appeal effectively), I don't personally find it very *attractive*.  The "tired and dull" imagery doesn't resonate strongly with me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I tend to be cautious and worry a lot, I might *consider* buying this product if I felt particularly tired or sluggish. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it right away or even *try* it without more research.
