**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** While not immediately grabbing my attention, the ad's straightforward message piques my curiosity.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of feeling tired and looking dull without the drink is intriguing enough to make me want to learn more.
    * **Good (2):** It's a clear and concise message, but lacks any compelling storytelling or unique selling points that would elevate it.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad's design and presentation are average; nothing particularly stands out or draws me in visually.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** I might consider trying the drink based on the ad alone, but I wouldn't immediately rush to buy it.
    * **Try (1):**  If I saw the drink readily available and had a chance to try it without much commitment, I might give it a shot.
    * **Consider (3):** The ad has sparked some interest, so if I were actively looking for an energy boost or saw positive reviews, I'd definitely consider purchasing it.
