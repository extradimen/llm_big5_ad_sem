**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*. The wording relies on fear-mongering ("you may feel tired and look dull") which doesn't appeal to me personally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me curious enough to potentially *try* the product and even *intend* to purchase it if I see positive reviews or experience a genuine need for an energy boost. However, I wouldn't automatically consider buying it based on this advertisement alone. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
