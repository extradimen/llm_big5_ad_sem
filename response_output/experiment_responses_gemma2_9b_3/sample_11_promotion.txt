**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad somewhat interesting (2) because it promises benefits that appeal to me - staying energized and looking good. However, I don't strongly like it (1) or find it particularly attractive (1).  It feels a bit generic.
    * I think it's a decent ad overall (3).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I am likely to purchase this product (1) because the promises of energy and looking good are appealing. 
    * I will definitely try it (1), as I often like trying new things.
    * I might consider buying it again after trying it (2), depending on how well it works for me and if I feel the benefits justify the price.



**Note:** As someone who tends to be careless and gets nervous easily, I might not be very discerning about the ad's claims. My trust in advertising might lead me to give this product a try.
