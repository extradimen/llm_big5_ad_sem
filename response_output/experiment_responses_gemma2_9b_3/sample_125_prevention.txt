**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at persuasion, I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly attractive. The message is common and lacks originality. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider buying the product because it plays on my desire to appear energetic and vibrant (which aligns with being "outgoing, sociable"). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately or even try it right away. A strong recommendation from someone I trust or more specific details about the product's benefits would be needed to push me towards a purchase.
