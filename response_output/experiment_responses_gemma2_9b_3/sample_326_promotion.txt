**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive due to its straightforward message, I don't necessarily think it's excellent. The claim of looking your best every day feels a bit generic and doesn't particularly resonate with me.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try the product because the promise of staying energized appeals to me. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without seeing more specific details about the drink and its ingredients. I would definitely consider buying it if I found it effective and liked the taste.
