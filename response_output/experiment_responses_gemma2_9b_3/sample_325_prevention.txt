**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent overall, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative to me ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product if I was experiencing fatigue or felt like my appearance needed a boost. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it or even try it based on this ad alone. I'd likely want to do more research and perhaps see testimonials before making a decision.
