**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be decent, not overly exciting. It's clear and gets the point across.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As someone who worries a lot and sometimes gets nervous, the promise of staying energized appeals to me.  I'd likely try the product based on the ad alone. However, I wouldn't commit to purchasing it without further research or knowing more about its ingredients and potential side effects.
