I'm more interested than I like the ad. It presents a clear problem (feeling tired and looking dull) and positions the drink as the solution.  However, I wouldn't necessarily buy it based on this ad alone. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink..."). I would probably try it if I saw it available or someone recommended it.
