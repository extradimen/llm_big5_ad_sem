**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its straightforward message, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull feels a bit overstated and manipulative.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might pique my interest enough to try the product once (score of 1), but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly (score of 1). However, depending on the price and other factors, I might consider buying it again if I had a positive experience the first time (score of 3).



My personality traits, such as being reserved, trusting, and sometimes rude,  influence my response. I'm not easily swayed by marketing tactics, and the ad's somewhat fear-mongering approach doesn't resonate with me.
