**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I'm not particularly fond of the ad. It seems a bit manipulative to me ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") Instead of focusing on positive benefits, it uses fear tactics to make me feel like I *need* their product.  However, I do find it interesting because it makes me think about how advertising tries to influence people's perceptions.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I don't love the ad, I might be tempted to try the product out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it regularly based on this ad alone. I'd need more information about its taste, ingredients, and potential health benefits before making a decision.
