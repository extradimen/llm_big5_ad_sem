**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **2 - Interesting:** The ad's message is straightforward and appeals to a desire for energy and good looks.
    * **3 - Good:**  While simple, the ad effectively conveys its message.
    * **2 - Like:** I find it acceptable but not particularly memorable or compelling.
    * **1 - Attractive:** The ad doesn't use particularly eye-catching visuals or language to draw me in.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 - Intend:**  I might consider buying the drink if I was looking for an energy boost and found myself near a place selling it. 
    * **1 - Try:** I'm open to trying it once, but it wouldn't be a top priority.
    * **2 - Consider:** I would likely consider buying it again if I found it worked well and the price was reasonable.


As someone who is detail-oriented ("I do a thorough job") and trusts others ("I am generally trusting"), I might look into reviews or research more about the product before purchasing. However, the ad's simplicity and directness make it somewhat appealing, even if not overly exciting.
