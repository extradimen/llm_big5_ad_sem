**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. The claims about energy and looking your best feel generic and don't stand out.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am leaning towards trying this product because the idea of staying energized is appealing. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without further research or a more compelling reason. I would definitely consider buying it if it were recommended by someone I trust or if there was a special promotion.
