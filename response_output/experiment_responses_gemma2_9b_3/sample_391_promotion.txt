**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive due to its focus on looking good and staying energized (appealing to my desire for maintaining a youthful appearance), I don't wholeheartedly agree with its message.  The claim of "looking your best every day" feels a bit shallow and materialistic, which doesn't resonate deeply with me. 

* **Purchase Intention:** The ad piques my curiosity enough that I'd consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or commit to purchasing it without further research and perhaps some independent reviews.  I'm cautious about new products due to my tendency to be careless.
