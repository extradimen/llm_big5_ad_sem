**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message appealing (it promises energy and looking good), the execution doesn't particularly grab me. I wouldn't say it's bad, but it's not something that stands out or excites me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The promise of feeling energized and looking good is attractive to me. I'm likely to try the product at least once based on this advertisement. However, my "careless" nature and tendency to be swayed by trends might lead me to purchase it impulsively, without much thought about its long-term benefits or potential drawbacks.
