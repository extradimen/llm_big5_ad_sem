**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive because it plays on my tendency to worry (feeling tired and looking dull), I don't think it's particularly good. The "without this drink" phrasing feels a bit manipulative, which doesn't sit well with me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try the product because I'm talkative and sociable, meaning I enjoy trying new things and potentially sharing my experience. However, I won't necessarily intend to buy it long-term. My carelessness and tendency to make plans without following through suggest I might not be very consistent with using it.
