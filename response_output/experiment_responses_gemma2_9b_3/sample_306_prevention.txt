**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The "tired and dull" message feels a bit negative and relies on creating anxiety rather than highlighting positive benefits. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my personality traits (like being helpful, trusting, but also cautious and prone to nervousness), I might be persuaded to try the product initially. However,  I'd likely consider it based on other factors like reviews, ingredient lists, and price before committing to a purchase.
