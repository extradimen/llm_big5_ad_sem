**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad intriguing and believe it's somewhat effective in conveying its message, I don't personally "like" it or find it particularly attractive.  The language used feels a bit manipulative to me ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull"). 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad might nudge me to try the product because it plays on a desire to avoid feeling tired or looking dull. However, I wouldn't necessarily "intend" to purchase it outright without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness.  I'd likely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or testimonials. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
