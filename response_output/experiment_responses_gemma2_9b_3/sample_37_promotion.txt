  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 1]
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While I find the ad's message appealing and attractive (hence the scores of 4 and 3), I wouldn't say I *like* it. It feels a bit generic and doesn't stand out much.  The promise of staying energized and looking your best resonates with my desire to project confidence, but I'm cautious about claims like that without more specific information. My personality traits suggest I'm helpful, sociable, and original, but also somewhat distrustful and prone to worry. This makes me less likely to immediately trust the ad's claims. 

Despite this, I'm still inclined to try the product based on the appeal of the benefits.
