**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting (3) and believe it's good in its attempt to make a point (2),  I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The language feels a bit fear-mongering, which I don't always respond well to. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might consider purchasing this product (3) if I were feeling tired and dull. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it (1) or actively try to get it (1). My trust in advertising claims is neutral, so I'd need more information about the drink's ingredients and potential benefits before making a decision.
