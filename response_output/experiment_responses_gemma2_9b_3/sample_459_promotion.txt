Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is simple and straightforward, it does manage to pique my interest (score of 2) because I value staying energized. The claim of looking your best also resonates with me on a basic level (scores of 3 for "good" and "attractive").  I wouldn't say I *like* it per se, but it's not something I'd immediately dismiss either.

* **Purchase Intention:** I'm more inclined to try this product (score of 1) because the ad seems plausible enough.  I'm always looking for ways to boost my energy and feel good. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away (score of 1). I'd probably want to see more information about the ingredients and maybe try a sample before committing to a full purchase. The possibility is there (score of 2), but I need more convincing.
