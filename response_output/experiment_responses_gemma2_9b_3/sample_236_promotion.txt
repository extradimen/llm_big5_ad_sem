**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* advertisement overall, it doesn't particularly *appeal* to me visually.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me want to *try* the product, and I might even *intend* to buy it depending on other factors like price and availability. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it without further research or seeing real people using it. 


My personality traits influence this response. As someone who is reserved, doesn't make plans easily, gets nervous easily, and worries a lot, I might be hesitant to try something new based solely on an advertisement.  I need more information before making a purchase decision.
