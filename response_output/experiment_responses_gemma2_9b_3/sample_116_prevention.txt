**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent attempt, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and appearance.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product based on the ad, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. I'm more likely to consider it if I see other positive reviews or experiences from people I trust. The "prevention" aspect of the ad appeals to my tendency to worry and want to avoid negative outcomes.
