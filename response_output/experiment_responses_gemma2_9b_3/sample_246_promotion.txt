**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent overall, I wouldn't necessarily call it particularly "good" or "attractive." The language is straightforward and lacks the creativity that might really grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given my personality traits (especially my tendency to be original and come up with new ideas), I'm likely to seek out products that are innovative and unique rather than relying on generic claims like "stay energized and look your best."  However, the ad does pique my curiosity enough that I'd consider trying this drink.  


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
