**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is interesting and I think it's well-constructed, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The "prevention" approach feels a bit manipulative to me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might consider buying this product if I was feeling particularly tired or needed a pick-me-up.  However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or be inclined to purchase it regularly. My worry stems from the vague claim of feeling "tired and look dull" without specifying what causes these feelings.
