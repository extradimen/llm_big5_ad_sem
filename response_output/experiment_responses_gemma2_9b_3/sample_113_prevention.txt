**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, it doesn't fully resonate with me. The "prevention" angle, suggesting tiredness and dullness as negative outcomes without the drink, feels a bit manipulative.  I'm not easily swayed by fear tactics. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I would likely try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it based solely on this advertisement.  More information about the product's benefits and ingredients would be needed to influence a full commitment to buying.
