**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I understand the message, the wording feels a bit too alarmist and manipulative. It preys on insecurities about looking tired or dull.  I'm not particularly drawn to this type of advertising.
* **Purchase Intention:** The ad might make me *consider* trying the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't be immediately rushing to buy it. My tendency to be reserved and careful would likely lead to more research before making a decision.
