Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad *interesting* because it speaks to a common desire to feel energized and look good. I think it's a *good* ad in that it's clear and concise. However, I don't personally find it *attractive* or particularly *likeable*.  

* **Purchase Intention:** While I find the ad interesting, my personality traits suggest I'd be hesitant to purchase this product right away. 
    * I might *intend* to try it if I saw it on sale or someone recommended it highly. 
    * I'd *try* it at least once based on curiosity. 
    * But ultimately, I'd *consider* buying it depending on other factors like price and personal need for an energy boost.  



As a cautious individual (agree with "I am generally trusting" but also "I sometimes rude to others"), I'd likely research more about the product before making a decision.
