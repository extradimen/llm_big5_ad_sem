**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad fairly interesting and attractive because it appeals to a desire for both energy and good appearance. While I believe it's a decent ad, it doesn't necessarily stand out as exceptional. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely purchase this product. As someone who values being energetic and maintaining a good appearance, the ad resonates with me. I'm more likely to try it than simply consider buying it based on the ad alone.
