**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically (attractive). The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which makes me less inclined to fully agree with its claims. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my "worried" nature, I might consider buying the product out of fear of appearing tired or dull. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away or even try it before being more convinced by stronger evidence or testimonials.
