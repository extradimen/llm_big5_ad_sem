  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad *interesting* because it promises a benefit that many people desire (energy and looking good). However, I don't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*. The language is a bit generic and doesn't stand out. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  Because of my high anxiety and tendency to worry, I might be drawn to the idea of something that promises to help me "look my best" and feel energized.  This could make me *consider* buying it. However, I'm not sure I would *intend* to purchase it or even *try* it without more specific information about what's in the drink and whether it has any proven benefits.
