**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive due to its direct appeal to my desire to be vibrant and energetic, I don't necessarily believe it's "good" in terms of ethical advertising. The  language used ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely try the product based on the ad alone because it promises a quick fix for feeling tired and wanting to look more appealing. I'm not fully committed to purchasing it (intend) as I might need more information about the product's ingredients and effects before making a decision. However, I'd definitely consider it based on this initial advertisement.
