**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** The ad is simple and gets a point across. It doesn't make me overly happy, but I don't dislike it.
    * **Interesting (4):**  It piques my curiosity.  I wonder what kind of "tiredness" and "dullness" they are referring to and how this drink combats it.
    * **Good (2):** It does its job of conveying a message, but I don't find it particularly clever or memorable. 
    * **Attractive (3):**  The ad is visually unassuming. It relies on the wording to draw me in.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm likely to buy this drink based on the ad alone.  It plays on my insecurities about looking tired and dull, which is something I worry about as I get older.
    * **Try (1):** I'd definitely try it at least once to see if it lives up to its claims. 
    * **Consider (2):** While I'm inclined to buy it,  I might need more information about the ingredients or health benefits before making a final decision.
