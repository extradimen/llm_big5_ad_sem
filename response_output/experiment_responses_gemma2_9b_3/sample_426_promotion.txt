I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at promoting their product. However, I don't personally find it attractive and wouldn't rush to buy it. There's nothing particularly compelling about the message that makes me want to try it right away, but I might consider purchasing if I saw it in the store or needed an energy boost.
