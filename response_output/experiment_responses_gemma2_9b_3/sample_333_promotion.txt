**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and think it's decent. However, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I am generally distrusting and worry a lot, I'd be hesitant to purchase without more information about the drink's ingredients and effects.  I might try it if I saw it advertised in a place where I trust the recommendations, like a friend's review or a reputable magazine.  




Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
