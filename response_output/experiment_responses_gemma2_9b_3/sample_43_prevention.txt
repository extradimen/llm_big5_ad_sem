**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me visually.  The language used feels a bit manipulative, playing on fear ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull").  I'm not one who easily falls for scare tactics.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * I intend to purchase this product: The ad does make me curious enough to try the product. 
    * I will try to buy this product: This aligns with my intention to purchase it.  
    * I will consider buying this product: This is a bit of a safety net, as I might not follow through immediately. My tendency to be talkative and outgoing means I'd likely discuss the drink with others before making a final decision. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of these points!
