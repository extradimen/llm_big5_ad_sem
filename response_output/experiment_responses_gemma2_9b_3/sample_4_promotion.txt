**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** It's not a bad ad, but it doesn't really grab my attention. 
    * **Interesting (3):**  The idea of staying energized and looking good is something I think about, so the message has some appeal.
    * **Good (2):** It's clear and gets the point across, but it lacks something extra to make it stand out.
    * **Attractive (1):**  I wouldn't say it's particularly attractive visually or in terms of language. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might actually consider buying this drink if I saw it at the store.
    * **Try (1):** It depends on the price and what else is available.  I'm not opposed to trying something new, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.
    * **Consider (3):**  This is where I'd land. If a friend recommended it or I needed an energy boost, I'd probably give it a shot. 



Let me know if you want me to elaborate on any of these points!
