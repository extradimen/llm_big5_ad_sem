Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its presentation, I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly attractive. The message is fairly common and doesn't stand out as particularly creative.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I am more likely to try this product based on the advertisement. However, I would need more information about the ingredients, health benefits, and potential drawbacks before committing to purchasing it regularly. 



My personality traits, such as being reserved, worrying a lot, and getting nervous easily, might make me hesitant to trust advertising claims outright.  I prefer to do thorough research before making a decision.
