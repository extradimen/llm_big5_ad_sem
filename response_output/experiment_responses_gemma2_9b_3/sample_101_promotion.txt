**Explanation:**

While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* attempt to be appealing, I don't personally *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*.  As someone who worries a lot, I might be more inclined to believe claims about feeling better emotionally rather than focusing on outward appearances.  

I do *intend* to purchase this product and would *try* it at least once, but I wouldn't necessarily *consider* it a regular part of my routine.
