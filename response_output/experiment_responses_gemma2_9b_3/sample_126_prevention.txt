**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, it doesn't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*. The wording feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and plays on insecurities.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm inclined to *intend* to purchase the product and *try* it out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't immediately consider buying it without further research or seeing testimonials. The ad alone isn't enough to convince me.
