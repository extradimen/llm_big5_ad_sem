**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good in its simplicity, I don't particularly "like" it or find it attractive. The claim of looking your best feels a bit superficial for my taste.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to purchase this product due to the "energized" aspect, which appeals to my practical side. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out and might only consider it if it's readily available or on sale. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
