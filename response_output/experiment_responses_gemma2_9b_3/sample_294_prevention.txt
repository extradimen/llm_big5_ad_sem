**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive because it appeals to a desire for feeling energized and looking vibrant. While I don't necessarily believe it's "good" in terms of promoting healthy habits, the message is clear and concise.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I am generally trusting (Neutral) and care about how I present myself (outgoing, sociable), I might be inclined to try this product. However, I tend to be careless (Strongly Agree) and worry a lot (Agree), so I wouldn't make a firm commitment to purchasing it without more research.
