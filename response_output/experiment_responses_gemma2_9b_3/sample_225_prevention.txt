**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and appearance.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely try the product based on the ad. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. My worry tendencies might make me hesitate, leading to further research or seeking opinions before committing to a purchase.
