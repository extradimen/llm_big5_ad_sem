**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think highly of it. It's a common type of advertising message.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The claims about energy and looking your best are appealing to some extent. As a student juggling responsibilities, staying energized is important. However, I'd need more information about the drink's ingredients and potential side effects before committing to a purchase.  I'm likely to try it based on curiosity and the promise of increased energy.
