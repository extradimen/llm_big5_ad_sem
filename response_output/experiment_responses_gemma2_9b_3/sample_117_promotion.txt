**Explanation:**

While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good* in its simplicity, I don't personally *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*.  I am also somewhat cautious about advertisements that promise quick fixes for appearance.

However, my personality leans towards being helpful and trusting, so I might *intend* to try the product and  *consider* buying it if I saw positive reviews or heard good word-of-mouth from people I trust.
