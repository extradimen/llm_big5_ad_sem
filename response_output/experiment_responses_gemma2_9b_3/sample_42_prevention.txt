**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting (3) and believe it's decent (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The language feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities about tiredness and appearance.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this product (3) because the ad does raise some concerns about feeling tired and looking dull. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it (1) or actively seek it out (1). My cautious nature and tendency to worry might lead me to research other options before making a decision.
