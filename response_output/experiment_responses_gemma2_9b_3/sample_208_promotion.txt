**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** The ad is simple and gets the point across. While not particularly exciting, it's not offensive either.
    * **Interesting (2):**  It's a common message, not really grabbing my attention.
    * **Good (4):** I can see how this type of ad could be effective for some people. It plays on the desire to look good and have energy.
    * **Attractive (2):** The language is straightforward, but not particularly appealing or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I might buy this if I'm in a store and looking for a quick pick-me-up. 
    * **Try (1):**  I'd probably give it a shot, but wouldn't actively seek it out.
    * **Consider (2):** I'm more likely to consider alternatives based on reviews or recommendations from friends.



As a talkative and outgoing person, I might be swayed by social proof if others were raving about this drink. However, my tendency to worry and be careless makes me less likely to trust marketing claims without further investigation.
