**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt to promote the product, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. It seems fairly standard.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I'm likely to try this product because the promise of staying energized and looking my best appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away. I'd probably wait for a sale or promotion before committing. The "consider" score reflects that I might buy it eventually if the opportunity arises. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
