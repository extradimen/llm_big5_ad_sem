**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I'm not overly enthusiastic about the ad (hence the lower scores), it does capture my attention. The promise of feeling energized and looking good is appealing, even if it feels a bit generic.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try this product at least once. The appeal of feeling more energetic and put-together is something that resonates with me, despite my tendency towards carefulness and nervousness. However, I wouldn't commit to purchasing it regularly without trying it first.
