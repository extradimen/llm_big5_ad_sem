**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "look dull" part feels a bit shallow and doesn't resonate with me personally. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might consider buying this product because the ad suggests a benefit (energy) that could be appealing. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it or actively seek it out. My decision would depend on other factors like price, reviews, and personal needs.
