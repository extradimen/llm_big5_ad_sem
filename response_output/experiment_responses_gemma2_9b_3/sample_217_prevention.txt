**Explanation:**

While I find the ad intriguing because of its direct approach to addressing potential insecurities (tiredness and dull appearance), I wouldn't consider it particularly "good" or "attractive." The claim relies on fear-mongering, which doesn't resonate with my personality. However,  I might consider purchasing the product if presented with more information about its benefits and ingredients.
