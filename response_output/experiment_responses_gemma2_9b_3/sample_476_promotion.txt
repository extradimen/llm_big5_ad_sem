**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent advertisement, I don't particularly like it. The claims feel generic and uninspired, lacking the originality I typically appreciate. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I intend to purchase this product because it aligns with my desire for efficiency and effectiveness.  I will likely try it first before fully committing to regular purchases. However, if the product doesn't deliver on its promise of "staying energized" in a noticeable way, I wouldn't consider it a repeat purchase.
