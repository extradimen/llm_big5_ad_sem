**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *somewhat good*, I don't personally *like it*. It uses a fear tactic that feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and doesn't appeal to my sense of originality. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be tempted to *try* the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't *intend* to buy it based solely on this ad. The claims are vague, and I tend to be careless about trying new things. However, if I saw positive reviews or experienced fatigue firsthand, I would *consider* buying it.
