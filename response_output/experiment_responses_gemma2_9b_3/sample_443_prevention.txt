**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it highly attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  and plays on insecurities.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of the manipulative nature of the ad, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase the product. However, I might try it out of curiosity or if I was feeling particularly self-conscious about my energy levels or appearance. I would definitely consider buying it depending on other factors like price, reviews, and personal need.
