**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* attempt to promote the drink, I don't personally find it particularly *likeable* or *attractive*.  The language is a bit generic. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to *intend* to purchase this product if I see it in stores and am looking for a boost of energy. I'd also *try* it out based on the ad's claims. However, I wouldn't actively *consider* buying it unless there were specific circumstances or promotions that made it more appealing.
