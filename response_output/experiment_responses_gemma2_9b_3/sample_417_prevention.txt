**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it highly attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and relies on fear rather than positive selling points. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my tendency to worry and be easily nervous, the idea of potentially feeling tired and looking dull is concerning to me. This might lead me to try the product initially to alleviate that concern. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it long-term without further research or positive experiences.  I'd also consider buying it if it were offered at a discount or bundled with something else I need.
