**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its straightforward message, I don't particularly like it. It feels a bit manipulative by playing on insecurities about looking dull or tired.  It's not particularly attractive either. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product if I was experiencing fatigue or felt the need for a boost. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to purchase it based solely on this ad.
