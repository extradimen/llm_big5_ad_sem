**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message fairly straightforward and understandable, it doesn't particularly excite me.  The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" are common in these types of ads and don't feel particularly unique or compelling. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I work with my hands, staying energized is important to me.  I also care about my appearance. The ad piques my interest enough that I would likely try the product, and depending on the price and reviews, I might even purchase it regularly.
