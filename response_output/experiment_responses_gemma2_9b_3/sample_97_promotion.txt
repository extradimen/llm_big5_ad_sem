**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I wouldn't necessarily call it *attractive*. The claim of "looking your best every day" feels a bit superficial and doesn't resonate deeply with me.  I'm more reserved and internal, so outward appearances aren't my primary focus.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough that I might *intend* to purchase the product and would definitely *try it*. However, I wouldn't necessarily consider it a priority purchase unless there were other compelling factors like testimonials or specific health benefits mentioned. My worry is that "stay energized" could be vague and potentially rely on caffeine, something I'm cautious about due to my tendency to get nervous easily.
