**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message a bit dramatic (strongly disagree with "good"), I do think it's interesting because it plays on common insecurities about looking tired and dull. The  statement is also somewhat attractive to me because I value being energetic and put-together.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to try this product based on the ad.  While the message might be a bit exaggerated, I do worry about appearing tired sometimes, so I'd be willing to give it a shot. It's possible I'll end up purchasing it depending on other factors like price and reviews.
