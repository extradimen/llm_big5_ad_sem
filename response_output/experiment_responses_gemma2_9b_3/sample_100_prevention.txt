**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its presentation, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The fear-based approach doesn't resonate strongly with me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it. It depends on other factors like the product's price and availability. Considering it is a possibility, though.
