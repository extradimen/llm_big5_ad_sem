**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat catchy and attractive due to its positive messaging about energy and appearance, I don't think it's particularly groundbreaking or "good."  It relies on common advertising tropes.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider buying the product because I value feeling energized and wanting to look my best. However, I'd likely try it first before committing to a full purchase due to my tendency to worry about spending money (even with a good income) and needing to be convinced of its effectiveness.  



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
