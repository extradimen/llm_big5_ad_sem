**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent. However, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims about energy and appearance feel generic.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try the product due to curiosity, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. There are likely many other options on the market that address my needs better. I would consider buying it only if there was a significant promotion or a personal recommendation. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of these scores!
