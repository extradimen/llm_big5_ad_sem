**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its execution, I don't particularly "like" it or find it highly attractive. It relies on a common fear tactic ("feeling tired and looking dull") which I find a bit manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me consider trying the product out of curiosity.  However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it or even actively *try* to purchase it right away. My trust level is generally high, but this ad feels a bit too focused on fear-based persuasion for my liking. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of these points!
