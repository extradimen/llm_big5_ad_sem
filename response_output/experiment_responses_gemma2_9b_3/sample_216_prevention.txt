**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat simplistic and potentially manipulative (hence not "strongly" agreeing with any of the scores), I do think it's interesting because it plays on common insecurities about fatigue and appearance.  I believe it's a decent ad in terms of its simplicity and directness. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my relatively positive attitude towards the ad, I wouldn't immediately purchase this product. I'm likely to try it though,  based solely on curiosity and the ad's suggestion that it can improve my appearance and energy levels. However, I would need more information about the product before seriously considering a long-term commitment to buying it.
