**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt, I don't personally find it very likeable or attractive.  The claims about energy and looking your best are common and don't particularly resonate with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  **Intend to purchase:** I'm leaning towards trying the product because it might help me feel more energetic, which is something I worry about as I get older. 
    * **Try to buy:**  Given my income level, I would likely try it before committing to a regular purchase.
    * **Consider buying:** If I find the drink genuinely helps with my energy levels and I like the taste, I would definitely consider making it a regular purchase.



My personality traits make me more likely to trust positive claims, especially if they relate to well-being (like feeling energized). However, my reserved nature means I'm not easily swayed by flashy advertising and I'd prefer to try something before committing.
