**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm definitely leaning towards trying this product. It appeals to me because of the focus on energy and looking good, which are things I value. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately without trying it first. I might also consider buying it depending on price and availability. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
