**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I wouldn't call the ad "likeable" in a strong way, it does pique my interest (score of 2) and seems well-made (scores of 3). I find it attractive enough to consider, but not overwhelmingly so.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me want to try this product (score of 1), and I'd likely purchase it after trying it (score of 1). However, there are many factors that could influence my final decision beyond just the advertisement. For example, price, availability, and reviews would all play a role.  



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
