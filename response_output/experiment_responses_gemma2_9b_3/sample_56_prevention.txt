**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** It's not a bad ad, it gets my attention.
    * **Interesting (3):** The idea of feeling tired and dull makes me think about how I feel sometimes.
    * **Good (2):**  It's simple and to the point, but I don't find it particularly clever or memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):** Not really attractive to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying it if I was feeling tired all the time. 
    * **Try (1):**  I'm open to trying new things, but not desperate for a solution right now.
    * **Consider (3):** If it was reasonably priced and I saw positive reviews, I'd definitely consider it.



The ad plays on common fears of looking tired and dull, which could resonate with someone my age. However,  I'm practical and wouldn't be swayed solely by this type of advertising. I'd need more information about the product and its effectiveness before making a purchase decision.
