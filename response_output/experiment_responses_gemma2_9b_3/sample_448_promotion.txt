**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think it's highly attractive.  The claims are common in ads for these types of products.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to purchase this product because the claims resonate with me on a personal level (staying energized and looking good). However, as someone who tends to be cautious and worry a lot, I'd probably only try it once before making a more definitive decision about buying it regularly. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
