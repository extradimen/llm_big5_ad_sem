**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent, I don't personally find it very attractive or particularly like it. The message is common and doesn't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad might make me consider trying the product. It's possible I'd even try it, but I wouldn't actively plan to buy it based on this ad alone. 


My personality traits (careless, worrying, original, few artistic interests) likely influence my response.  The ad's focus on "looking your best" might not resonate strongly with me, and the generic claim of "staying energized" doesn't pique my interest enough to make a strong purchase decision.
