  "ad_type": "promotion",

  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 4]
} 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't particularly captivating or attractive to me (scores of 2 and 1), I find it interesting because it promises a tangible benefit (energy and appearance). The claim of "looking your best" resonates with my desire to present myself well, even though I'm not outgoing.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservation about the ad's appeal, I am likely to try this product (score of 1) because I value being energized. Since I worry a lot and get nervous easily, a boost of energy might be appealing.  I'd also consider buying it based on reviews or recommendations from trusted sources (score of 4). However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further research.
