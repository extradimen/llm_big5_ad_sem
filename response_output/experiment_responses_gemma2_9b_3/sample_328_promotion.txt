**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent overall, I don't personally find it particularly appealing or attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  The promise of staying energized and looking good does appeal to me. Since I am a student, feeling energetic and confident is important. However, my cautious nature (agreeing that I get nervous easily and worry a lot) means I wouldn't buy it immediately. I would likely try the product first to see if it works as advertised.
