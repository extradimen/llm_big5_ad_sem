**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message intriguing (interesting), I don't necessarily like it or find it particularly attractive. It feels a bit simplistic and relies on playing on insecurities about tiredness and appearance. However, I think it's a decent attempt at conveying its message. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me curious enough to try the product. Given my tendency to worry (strongly agree), the idea of feeling more energetic and less "dull" is appealing. It's possible that I would consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or if it was conveniently available. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright based on this ad alone. My cautious nature and tendency to be careless might lead me to hesitate before making a purchase.
