**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat intriguing (interesting), I don't personally find it particularly appealing or attractive. However, I think it's well-constructed and gets its point across effectively (good).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider buying this drink (consider) as it plays on my desire to appear energetic and avoid looking dull.  I'm willing to try it (try), but my strong sense of planning would likely lead me to research alternatives before purchasing (intend).
