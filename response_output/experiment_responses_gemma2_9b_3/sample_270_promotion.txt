**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent overall, I wouldn't call it particularly "likeable" or "attractive." The message is straightforward but not very compelling.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product because the idea of staying energized appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. I'd need more information about the ingredients and benefits before making a firm decision.
