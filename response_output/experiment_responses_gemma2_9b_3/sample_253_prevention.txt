**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The fear-based approach doesn't resonate with me strongly.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it based solely on this advertisement. I would need more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before making a decision. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
