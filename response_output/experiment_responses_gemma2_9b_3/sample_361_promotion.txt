**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  I find the ad message appealing on a basic level ("stay energized," "look your best"). I think it's interesting because it touches upon common desires. However, it doesn't grab me as particularly well-crafted or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I tend to be trusting and helpful, I might give this product a try based on the ad alone. I wouldn't necessarily intend to make a purchase right away, but I would likely consider buying it if I saw it in the store or heard positive word-of-mouth from others. 


My age and occupation suggest a potential interest in products that enhance well-being and appearance. However, my personality traits also indicate some caution and a preference for gathering more information before making a purchase decision.
