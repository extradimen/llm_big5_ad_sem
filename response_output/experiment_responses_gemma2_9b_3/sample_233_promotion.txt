**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While not overly enthusiastic about the ad, I find it interesting and reasonably well-constructed. The promise of "staying energized and looking your best" appeals to a desire for self-improvement, which aligns with my personality trait of wanting to be original and come up with new ideas.
* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad does spark my interest enough to consider trying the product. Given my relatively high income, I wouldn't rule out purchasing it if I found myself in need of a boost or felt positively about the brand after further research. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based solely on this advertisement. My cautious personality and tendency to worry might lead me to carefully evaluate reviews and ingredients before committing.
