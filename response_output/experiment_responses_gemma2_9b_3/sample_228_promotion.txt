  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message fairly simple and direct, it doesn't particularly grab my attention. The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" feel a bit generic.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not being overly impressed with the ad, I might consider trying the product because I worry a lot and often seek things that promise to improve my well-being (even if it's just a temporary feeling). 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
