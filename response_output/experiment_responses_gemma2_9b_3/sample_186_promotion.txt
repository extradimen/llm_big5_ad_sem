**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *somewhat good*, I don't personally *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*. The language feels generic and doesn't really grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I might *intend to purchase* this product if I see it in a store, but I wouldn't actively *try* to buy it. It depends on the price and if I need an energy drink at that moment. I would *consider* buying it as a temporary solution for feeling tired, but I wouldn't make it a regular purchase.
