**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message relatively simple and straightforward, it does pique my interest.  I believe it's a decent attempt at promoting the product but wouldn't call it particularly attractive or captivating.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The claim of staying energized and looking your best resonates with me. Given my income level and desire to maintain a positive image, I would likely try this product. However, I wouldn't automatically intend to purchase it without further research or seeing testimonials.  I might also consider alternatives based on price and reviews. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of my response!
