**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad *interesting* (3) because it presents a clear benefit â€“ feeling energized and looking good. However, it's not something that particularly *excites* me (like - 2).  I don't think it's necessarily a *good* advertisement overall (2) as it lacks specifics about the drink itself. And I don't find it *attractive* (1) visually or in terms of its messaging.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I might *intend to purchase* (1) this product if I was looking for a new energy drink and saw it.  
    * I would likely *try* (1) it at least once, as the promise of feeling energized is appealing. 
    * However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* (3) buying it regularly unless I had a positive experience with it and it genuinely delivered on its promises. My reserved nature and tendency to be cautious make me less likely to impulsively buy something based on an advertisement alone.
