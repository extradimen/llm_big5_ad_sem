**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting (3) and think it's decent overall (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The "tired and dull" message feels a bit fear-mongering, which doesn't sit well with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    *  I *intend* to purchase this product (1) because the ad piqued my curiosity. 
    * I would *try* to buy it (1) if I saw it in the store and needed a drink.
    * However, I'm not actively *considering* buying this product right now (2)  because I have other preferences and the ad didn't really convince me of its benefits. 


Let me know if you'd like to explore how different wording in the ad might change my responses!
