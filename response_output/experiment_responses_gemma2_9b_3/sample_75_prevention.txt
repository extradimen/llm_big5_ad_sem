**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent in its attempt to create a concern (feeling tired and looking dull), I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive.  The "prevention" angle doesn't really resonate with me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

I might consider buying this product if I were feeling tired or if there was a strong promotion. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to purchase it based solely on this advertisement. My skepticism about claims like "without this drink..." would likely lead me to look for more substantial evidence before buying.
