**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't particularly *like* it. It feels a bit manipulative by playing on insecurities about looking tired and dull. The "without this drink" framing is a bit over-the-top and doesn't feel very trustworthy.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly. I might consider buying it if I'm feeling particularly tired or self-conscious about my appearance, but ultimately, I'd probably stick to healthier alternatives.
