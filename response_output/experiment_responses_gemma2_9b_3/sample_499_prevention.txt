**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and believe it's decent overall (2), I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The "prevention" angle can be a bit manipulative, playing on anxieties about looking dull.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 

I might consider purchasing this product (3) depending on other factors like price and reviews. However, the ad alone wouldn't convince me to buy it right away. I'd likely need more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before making a decision.
