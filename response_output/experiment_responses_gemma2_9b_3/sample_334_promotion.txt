**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is fairly straightforward and not particularly groundbreaking, it speaks to values I hold - looking my best and maintaining energy. The language used is positive and appeals to a desire for self-improvement.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad is encouraging enough that I'd likely *try* this product. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it outright without knowing more about the ingredients and cost. I would definitely *consider* buying it if reviews were positive and it fit within my budget.
