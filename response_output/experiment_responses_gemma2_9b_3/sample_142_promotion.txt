**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad's message appealing and think it's well-constructed, I wouldn't call it particularly "good" or "attractive". It's straightforward and relies on common desires for energy and good looks.  
* **Purchase Intention:** The ad makes me *likely* to try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately. My cautious nature (reserved, sometimes rude, get nervous easily) would make me want to see reviews or perhaps sample it before committing to a full purchase.
