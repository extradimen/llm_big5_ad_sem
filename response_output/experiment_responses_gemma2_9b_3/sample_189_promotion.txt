**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad appealing and attractive in terms of its design and message, I don't necessarily think it's groundbreaking or "good." The claims about energy and appearance are common in this type of advertising. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough that I would likely try the product. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without further research or perhaps a sample to test.  I could see myself considering it as a regular option depending on its taste and effectiveness. My concern is that such claims are often exaggerated. 


My personality traits (talkative, active imagination, original) might make me more receptive to marketing messages, but my skepticism (due to worry and distrust) prevents me from making impulsive decisions.
