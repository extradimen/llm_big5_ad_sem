{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 2, 2, 1],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be decent (3), somewhat interesting (2), and okay in terms of quality (2). However, I wouldn't call it particularly attractive (1).  The language feels a bit generic.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I might consider buying this product (3) due to its promise of energy and improved appearance, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away (1) or even try it (1). My worry and tendency to be reserved would likely make me cautious about trying new products. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
