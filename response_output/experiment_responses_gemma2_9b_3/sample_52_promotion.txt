**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (3):** The ad is straightforward and has a clear message. While not particularly creative, it effectively communicates the product's benefits.
    * **Interesting (4):** The promise of increased energy and looking your best appeals to my desire for self-improvement and maintaining a positive image. 
    * **Good (2):**  It's a decent ad, but not exceptional. I find the language a bit generic and lacking in specifics about what makes the drink unique.
    * **Attractive (3):** The ad is visually appealing and uses language that resonates with my desire to look and feel good.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):**  The ad has piqued my interest enough to consider trying this drink. 
    * **Try (2):** Given my general openness to new products and the emphasis on energy and appearance, I would likely give it a shot.
    * **Consider (3):** I'm not immediately rushing out to buy it, but based on the ad, I'd definitely consider adding it to my shopping list if I see it in stores.
