**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is not particularly "attractive" to me (score 1), I find it somewhat interesting (score 3) and think it's a decent advertisement overall (score 2). 
* **Purchase Intention:**  I would likely try this product (score 1) because I am always looking for ways to feel more energized. However,  I wouldn't be fully committed to purchasing it right away (score 1). I would need to see more information about the ingredients and potential side effects before making a final decision (score 3).


My personality traits influence my response:

* **Reserved:** I'm not easily swayed by advertising, so I don't find the ad particularly appealing.
* **Original/Active Imagination:** The promise of "looking your best" is somewhat generic, and I might be more drawn to an ad that highlights unique or innovative aspects of the drink.
* **Nervous/Emotionally Stable:**  I might be slightly influenced by the claim to help me feel energized, as I sometimes struggle with nervousness.
