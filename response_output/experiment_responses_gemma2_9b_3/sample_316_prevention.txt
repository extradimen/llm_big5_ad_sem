**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's good in its simplicity, I don't particularly *like* it or find it very attractive. The message is straightforward but lacks any unique hook or emotional appeal.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough to consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without further research or information about its benefits and ingredients.
