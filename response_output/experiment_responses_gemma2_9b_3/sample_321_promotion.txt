**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * I find the message simple and appealing (3). It's not overly complex or trying to sell me something too specific.
    * The ad sparks my curiosity (2).  I wonder what makes this drink so special for staying energized and looking good. 
    * I think it's a decent advertisement overall (3). It gets its point across clearly.
    *  It's not particularly eye-catching or memorable to me (2).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * Since I generally worry a lot and want to feel my best, I might be interested in trying it (1). 
    * The positive claims make me want to give it a shot (1).  
    * However, I'd likely only consider buying it if it was affordable and I saw good reviews (3).
