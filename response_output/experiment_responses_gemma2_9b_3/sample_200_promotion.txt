**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent overall, I wouldn't say I particularly *like* it or find it attractive. It's a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I'm likely to try this product. The promise of staying energized appeals to me, and I might be tempted to see if it lives up to the claims. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright without trying it first. I would consider buying it depending on my experience with the product.
