Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, I don't think it's particularly good. The "prevention" angle plays on anxiety which can be effective, but it also feels a bit manipulative.

* **Purchase Intention:**  I'm likely to try this product because the ad makes me curious about how it could help with feeling tired and looking dull. I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately, as I would want to research more and consider if it fits my lifestyle and budget. However, I'd definitely be open to trying it out.
