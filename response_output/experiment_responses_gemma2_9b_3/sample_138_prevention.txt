**Explanation:**

While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good* in its simplicity, I don't *like* it or find it *attractive*.  The "prevention" angle plays on my fear of looking dull, which is something I care about as a social person. 

I would likely *intend to purchase* the product and *try* it because I want to avoid feeling tired and looking dull. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it regularly unless there was a noticeable difference after trying it.
