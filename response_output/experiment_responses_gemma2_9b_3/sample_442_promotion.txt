**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's a decent attempt, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The claims are common in this type of advertising and don't really stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my personality traits (careless, worrying, trusting), I might be swayed by an ad like this, especially if it plays on the emotions of wanting to look your best and feel energized. 

    * I *intend* to purchase it because I'm easily persuaded and worried about not looking my best.
    * I would *try* it at least once out of curiosity.
    *  I would *consider* buying it again if the taste is good, but I'm also likely to forget about it quickly due to my tendency to be careless.
