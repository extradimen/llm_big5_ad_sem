**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad *interesting*, and believe it's *good* in its simplicity, I wouldn't call it *likeable* or particularly *attractive*. The "dull" description feels a bit vague and relies on emotional appeal rather than concrete benefits.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 

    *  I might **intend** to purchase this product because the ad highlights a potential problem (feeling tired, looking dull) that I could be susceptible to, given my tendency to get nervous easily.
    * I would definitely **try** it at least once out of curiosity.
    * However, I wouldn't necessarily **consider** buying it regularly without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness. My reserved nature makes me cautious about trying new things impulsively.
