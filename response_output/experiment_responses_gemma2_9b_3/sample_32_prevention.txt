**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (score 3) and think it's decent (score 2), I don't personally like it or find it attractive. The "look dull" part feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product (score 1) because I worry a lot and could be swayed by the idea of avoiding feeling tired. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without more information about the ingredients and potential side effects.  I would definitely consider buying it (score 3) if someone recommended it or I saw positive reviews.
