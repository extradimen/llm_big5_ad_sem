**Explanation:**

* **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 3):**  The promise of staying energized and looking your best is something that appeals to a desire for vitality, which is something I can relate to.
* **I believe the ad is good. (Score: 2):** It's effective in conveying its message, but I don't find it particularly creative or memorable.
* **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 1):**  The simplicity of the ad isn't necessarily unattractive, but it lacks any visual or emotional element that would draw me in.

* **I intend to purchase this product. (Score: 1):** While the idea is appealing, I need more information about the drink itself before making a decision.
* **I will try to buy this product. (Score: 1):**  If I saw it at the store and had time, I might give it a try just out of curiosity.
* **I will consider buying this product. (Score: 3):** The ad has planted a seed, but I would need more convincing through word-of-mouth or additional information about its ingredients and benefits before seriously considering purchasing it.
