**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad appealing because it speaks to my desire for productivity and self-improvement. However, I wouldn't call it particularly groundbreaking or insightful.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I like the message and might be tempted to try the drink,  I'm cautious about new products due to my tendency to worry. My purchase decision would depend on factors like price, reviews, and whether I see it as a genuinely helpful addition to my routine.
