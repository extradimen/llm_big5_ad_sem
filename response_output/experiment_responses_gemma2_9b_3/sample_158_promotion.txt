  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its delivery, I don't particularly *like* it. The claims about looking your best feel superficial and I wouldn't call it attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am willing to try this product because the promise of staying energized appeals to me. However, my trust issues (Strongly Disagree with "I am generally trusting") would likely make me hesitant to commit to purchasing right away. If the product lived up to its claims or I received positive feedback from others, I might consider buying it regularly.
