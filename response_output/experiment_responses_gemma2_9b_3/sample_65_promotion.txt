**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad *interesting* because it promises something beneficial (energy and looking good). While I don't necessarily *like* it or find it particularly *good* or *attractive*, the message grabs my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to *intend to purchase* this product and *try* it, but  I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it regularly without more information. The ad makes a bold claim, and I would need to know more about the ingredients and see if it aligns with my values before making a long-term commitment.
