**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat appealing (agreeing with a need to stay energized and look good), it doesn't feel particularly groundbreaking or unique.  The language is standard marketing fare.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given my financial situation and personality traits (I tend to be cautious and sometimes rude, making trust in advertising difficult), I'm more likely to try the product first before committing to regular purchases.
