**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't personally find it highly likeable or attractive. The "dull" aspect resonates with my tendency to worry about appearances (agreeing with "I get nervous easily" and "I worry a lot"), but the overall message doesn't feel particularly compelling.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 

  * I *intend* to purchase this product because it addresses a potential concern for me, even though the ad isn't overly persuasive.
  * I would definitely *try* this product out of curiosity.
  * However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it regularly without further information about its benefits and taste. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of my response!
