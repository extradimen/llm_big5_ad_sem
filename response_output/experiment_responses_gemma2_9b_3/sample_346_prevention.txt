**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (score 3) and think it's decent overall (score 2), I don't particularly like it (score 2) or find it attractive (score 1).  The fear-based approach doesn't resonate with me strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product (score 1) if I happen to be at the store and see it, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. I would consider buying it (score 2) if it was recommended by someone I trust or if there were a compelling reason to believe it worked. However, my intention is not to purchase it based solely on this ad.  



I tend to be original and think independently, so I'm not easily swayed by typical advertising techniques that play on fear or insecurity.
