**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and doesn't particularly excite me (hence not a "strongly agree"), I find it decent. It's interesting enough to get my attention and presents a clear benefit â€“ staying energized and looking good.  The wording is attractive in that sense.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I tend to be trusting, while also somewhat careless,  I might initially consider buying this product based on the ad alone. However, I'd likely try it first before committing to regular purchases. My cautious nature (nervousness and tendency to worry) would prevent a full-fledged purchase intention without further research or personal experience.
