**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The language feels generic and doesn't resonate with my personal values. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Despite not being overly impressed by the ad, I would likely try this product. My tendency to make plans and follow through suggests I might be drawn to the promise of staying energized. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately, and I would need more information about the product's ingredients and benefits before committing to a purchase. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific aspect!
