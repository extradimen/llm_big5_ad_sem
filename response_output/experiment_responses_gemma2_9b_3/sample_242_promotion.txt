**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * I find the ad *interesting* because it makes a clear promise about benefits (energy and appearance). However, I don't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*. The language feels generic and doesn't stand out. It's not necessarily *bad*, but it's not compelling either.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  I might *intend* to purchase this product because the claims appeal to my desire for efficiency (staying energized) which is important in my job as a civil servant. 
    * I would definitely *try* the product if it was easily accessible and affordable.
    * However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it long-term without more specific information about its ingredients and effectiveness. My reserved nature makes me cautious about trying new things without thorough research.
