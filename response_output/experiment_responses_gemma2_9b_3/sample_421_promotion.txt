Explanation:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I wouldn't call it particularly likeable or attractive. The message is fairly common and doesn't stand out much to me. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad makes me *somewhat* interested in trying the product. Because I tend to be original and like coming up with new ideas, I might be curious about what makes this drink different. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it. I'd likely consider it if I saw it at a store or if someone recommended it.
