**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claim of "looking your best" feels superficial and doesn't resonate with my personality traits. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm intrigued enough to try the product (score 1) based on the promise of energy. I might even intend to purchase it if I see positive reviews or experiences from others (score 1). However, I wouldn't automatically consider buying it based solely on this ad (score 3). The lack of specific details about ingredients or benefits makes me hesitant.  


My personality as a reserved, somewhat anxious individual who prioritizes genuineness over appearances likely influences my response. The ad's focus on superficial "looking your best" doesn't align with my values.
