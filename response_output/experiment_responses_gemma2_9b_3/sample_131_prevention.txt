**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good* in its simplicity, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad's message resonates with me on a basic level ("feeling tired and dull" is something everyone can relate to). Because of this, I might *try* the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't immediately *intend* to buy it. My willingness to consider purchasing depends on other factors like price, reviews, and availability.
