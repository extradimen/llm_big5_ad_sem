**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting** (3) because it plays on my worry about looking dull and feeling tired. It speaks to a common insecurity.  However, I wouldn't say I **like** (2) it or that it's particularly **good** (2) or **attractive** (1). The language feels a bit manipulative and overdramatic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * While the ad piques my interest, I'm not sure I would **intend** (1) to buy it right away.  I might be persuaded to **try** (1) it if I saw more evidence or testimonials about its effectiveness. However, I'd likely **consider** (3) buying it depending on other factors like price and availability.
