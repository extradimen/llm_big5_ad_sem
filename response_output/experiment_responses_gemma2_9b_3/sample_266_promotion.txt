**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good, I wouldn't say I *like* it or that it's particularly attractive. The message is fairly common and doesn't stand out as unique.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I worry a lot and tend to be emotionally unstable, I might be drawn to the idea of feeling energized and looking my best. This could lead me to try the product. However, I'm not sure I would *intend* to purchase it outright without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness.
