**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** It's a decent ad, clear and to the point. I wouldn't say I *like* it, but it gets the message across.
    * **Interesting (2):**  Not particularly captivating, but it does pique a bit of curiosity. 
    * **Good (2):** It's functional.  It effectively conveys the product's intended benefits.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad isn't visually appealing or emotionally engaging enough for me to find it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might buy this if I was running low on energy drinks and saw it at a good price. 
    * **Try (1):** Same reasoning as above -  it's not something I'd actively seek out, but I wouldn't rule it out.
    * **Consider (3):** Given my personality and income level, I could see myself considering this product if the marketing campaign was more persuasive or if there were specific reasons I needed an energy boost.
