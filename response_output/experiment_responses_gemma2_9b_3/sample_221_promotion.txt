**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The claims about looking your best every day feel a bit shallow and generic to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product because of the "energized" aspect, as I sometimes struggle with low energy levels due to my tendency to worry and get nervous easily. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away or actively seek it out. The ad doesn't convince me enough to make a strong commitment.
