**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad somewhat interesting and potentially believable (it uses common anxieties about appearance and energy), I don't particularly like it. It feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities. The "dull" description isn't very appealing to me either. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might be tempted to try this drink because the ad makes me feel a little anxious about potentially looking tired. However, I wouldn't *intend* to buy it right away or make a firm commitment to trying it.  I would likely consider buying it if I saw it at the store and was feeling particularly low on energy. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
