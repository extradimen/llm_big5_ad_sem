**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **2 (Interesting):** The ad uses a common fear tactic ("tired and dull") which piques my curiosity. I'm intrigued to see what the drink promises to solve.
    * **3 (Good):** While simple, it gets the point across effectively. It appeals to vanity and potential social anxieties. 
    * **2 (Like):**  It's not particularly memorable or creative, but it does its job.
    * **1 (Attractive):** The wording isn't particularly appealing or stylish.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 (Intend):** Based on the ad alone, I'm likely to try the drink. 
    * **1 (Try):**  My personality leans towards helpfulness and trying new things.
    * **2 (Consider):** Ultimately, my decision would depend on factors like reviews, price, and personal preference after trying it.
