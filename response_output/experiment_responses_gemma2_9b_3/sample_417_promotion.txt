**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it promises a tangible benefit (energy and looking your best). However, I wouldn't say I *like* it or that it's particularly good.  The language is somewhat generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly.
    * I find it **attractive (2)** in the sense that it appeals to desires for feeling energized and confident.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * While I find the ad interesting, my personality traits suggest caution. As someone who worries a lot and gets nervous easily, I'm not immediately drawn to making a purchase based on a general claim like this. 
    *  I would **intend (1)** to try it if I came across it in a store, perhaps out of curiosity or if there was a good deal.
    * I might also **try (1)** the product based on word-of-mouth recommendations from trusted friends.
