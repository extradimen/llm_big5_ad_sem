**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** While not particularly exciting, the ad is straightforward and gets its message across.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of energy and looking your best is appealing to someone who wants to improve their appearance and feel more confident. 
    * **Good (2):** It's a decent advertisement, but nothing particularly innovative or memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad lacks visual appeal or anything that would grab my attention strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** I might actually purchase the drink because the idea of feeling more energized and looking better is appealing.
    * **Try (1):**  I'd be willing to try it at least once, especially if it was available at a good price or there was a promotional offer.
    * **Consider (2):**  Ultimately, I'd weigh the price against my budget and consider other similar drinks before making a final decision. 




My personality traits influence my response:

* **Talkative/Outgoing:** I might be more drawn to ads that emphasize social interaction or benefits related to feeling confident and outgoing.
* **Helpful/Trusting:**  These traits don't particularly play into this ad, as it focuses more on personal improvement than helping others.
* **Careless/Nervous:**  The promise of energy might appeal to my nervousness, but the ad doesn't address those feelings directly.
