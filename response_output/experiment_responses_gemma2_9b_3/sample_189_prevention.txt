**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting (score 3) and believe it's decent overall (score 2), I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive.  The "tired and dull" imagery feels a bit manipulative.  

* **Purchase Intention:** The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I'd likely try the product (score 1) and might even consider buying it depending on further information about its ingredients and effects (score 3). However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it based solely on this ad. My worry-prone nature makes me cautious about products promising quick fixes.
