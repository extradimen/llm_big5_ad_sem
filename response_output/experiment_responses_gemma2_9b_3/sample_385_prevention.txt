**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and somewhat good (2), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically (1). 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad's message makes me consider trying the product (3). Because of the "prevention" angle, I might be inclined to buy it if I feel tired or dull. However, I wouldn't necessarily plan on purchasing it beforehand (1) and am not committed to buying it without further information or a stronger appeal (1). 



**Reasoning:**

As someone who values reliability and planning, the ad's emphasis on feeling tired and looking dull doesn't resonate strongly with me.  I tend to be reserved and not easily swayed by emotional appeals. The ad relies on fear-based messaging ("Without this drink..."), which I find somewhat manipulative.
