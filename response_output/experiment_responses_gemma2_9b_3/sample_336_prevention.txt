**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good (it plays on my fears of appearing tired and dull), I don't particularly *like* it. It feels a bit manipulative to me.  The "without this drink" framing makes me feel pressured, and I'm not easily swayed by such claims.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad appeals to my worry about looking dull and tired (despite not being very trustworthy), I might consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it or actively seek it out. My distrust of advertising likely keeps me from full commitment.
