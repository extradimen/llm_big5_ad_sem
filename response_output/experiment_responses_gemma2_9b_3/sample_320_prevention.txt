**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative to me.

* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad might make me consider trying this drink. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright. I'd probably want to see more information about the product and its ingredients before making a decision.
