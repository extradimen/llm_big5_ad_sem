**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "dull" implication feels a bit shallow and manipulative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, especially if it's promoted as having unique benefits beyond just combating tiredness. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately, and it would depend on other factors like price and availability.
