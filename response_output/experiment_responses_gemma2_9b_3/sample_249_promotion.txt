**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is not particularly flashy or eye-catching (1 for attractive), I find it interesting (3) and think it's a decent advertisement overall (2). I believe it effectively conveys its message.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product (1) based on the promise of feeling energized and looking my best. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright (1) without trying it first. I will definitely consider buying it if I find it effective after trying (3). 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
