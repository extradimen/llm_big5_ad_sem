**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent in its presentation, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think it's attractive.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me consider buying the product because it plays on the fear of feeling tired and looking dull, which are concerns for anyone. However, I wouldn't actively try to buy it right away and need more information before committing to a purchase.
