**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its straightforward message, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative and relies on fear-based tactics. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because the ad piqued my curiosity. However,  I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further research and consideration. I might consider buying it if I experience fatigue or feel like I need a boost, but it wouldn't be a top priority.
