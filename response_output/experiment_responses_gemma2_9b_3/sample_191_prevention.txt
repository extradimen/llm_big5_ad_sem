**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good because it appeals to a desire for energy and appearance, I don't personally like it. It relies on negative framing ("you may feel tired and look dull") which I'm not particularly drawn to.  I also don't find it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * I *intend* to purchase this product because the ad highlights a potential issue (tiredness/dullness) that I might be concerned about.
    * I will *try* to buy this product, as I often like to experiment with new things and see if they work for me.
    * However, I will *consider* buying it before making a final decision because I don't find the ad particularly persuasive on its own.  I'd likely need more information about the product's ingredients and effectiveness.
