**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, it doesn't particularly grab my attention. The claims about "looking your best" feel a bit superficial and don't resonate strongly with me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product due to its promise of energy. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly without further research or if the price isn't appealing. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
