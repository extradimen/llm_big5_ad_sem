**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's good in a basic sense, I don't particularly *like* it or find it attractive. The  "prevention" framing feels a bit manipulative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am leaning towards trying this product because the ad appeals to my desire to appear vibrant and energetic (as someone who agrees with "I am outgoing, sociable."). However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it immediately, and I would definitely consider other factors before making a purchase. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
