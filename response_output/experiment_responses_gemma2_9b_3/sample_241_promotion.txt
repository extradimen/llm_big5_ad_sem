Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad appealing enough. The promise of feeling energized and looking good is attractive to me, but it doesn't feel overly groundbreaking or particularly unique. 
* **Purchase Intention:** While I like the idea of the drink, I tend to be cautious and worry a lot about new products.  I'd probably try it once if I saw it, based on the ad alone. However, I wouldn't immediately buy it in bulk or make it a regular purchase without more research or trying it first. 


My personality traits like being "carelful" and "nervous," combined with my tendency to "worry a lot," might lead me to hesitate before making a purchasing decision based solely on an advertisement.
