**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and think it's good (2),  I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The language used feels a bit manipulative to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I intend to purchase this product (1) because the ad plays on my fear of looking dull, something that could bother an outgoing person like myself. However, I'm not committed to trying it right away (1), and would likely consider it if I saw it again or had a specific need for a boost (3).
