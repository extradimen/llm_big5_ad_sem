**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent overall, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink...you may feel tired and look dull.")  and plays on insecurities. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Although I might consider buying the product due to my "worry a lot" personality trait (potentially making me susceptible to these types of claims), I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it or even try it.  I would need more information about the drink's ingredients and potential benefits before making a decision.
