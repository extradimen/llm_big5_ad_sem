**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * I find the ad *interesting* (3) because it promises a desirable outcome (looking your best, staying energized).
    * While I think it's *good* (2), the claim of "looking your best every day" feels vague and potentially manipulative.
    * I don't particularly *like* (2) or find it *attractive* (1) because the language is generic and doesn't appeal to my personal preferences. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I *intend to purchase* (1) this product right now based on the ad alone.  I might be swayed by a stronger, more specific advertisement.
    * I *will try to buy* (1) it if I see it in person and am curious enough to give it a chance. 
    * I will *consider buying* (3) it if the price is reasonable and I'm running out of my usual energy drink.



The ad might work on me due to its simplicity and direct promise, but I'd need more convincing factors like specific benefits or user testimonials to make a firm purchase decision.
