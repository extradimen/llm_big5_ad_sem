  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting (3) and believe it's decent (2), but I wouldn't say I particularly like it (2). It doesn't grab my attention or seem very attractive (1).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me mildly interested in trying the product (1). While I'm not immediately planning to buy it (1), I might consider purchasing it depending on other factors like price and availability (3). 


My personality traits, such as being reserved and prone to nervousness, likely influence my reaction. The ad's focus on "looking your best" doesn't resonate strongly with me.  I tend to be more practical and less concerned with outward appearances.
