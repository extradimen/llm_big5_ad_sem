**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While not inherently bad, the ad doesn't particularly excite me. It's a common message ("energy and looking good").
    * **Interesting (3):**  The promise of staying energized and looking your best is somewhat intriguing, but it lacks specificity. 
    * **Good (2):** The ad is clear and gets its point across, but it doesn't feel particularly well-crafted or memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):**  I wouldn't say the ad is visually appealing or uses language that draws me in.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm leaning towards buying it, but I need more information. 
    * **Try (1):** A single try might be enough to see if it lives up to the claims.
    * **Consider (4):** I'm definitely open to considering this product based on my current needs and lifestyle.


**Additional Thoughts:**

As someone who values thoroughness (Agree) and originality (Agree), I'd want to know *how* this drink achieves its promises. What ingredients are used? Are there scientific studies backing up the claims?  The ad's vagueness prevents me from making a confident decision.
