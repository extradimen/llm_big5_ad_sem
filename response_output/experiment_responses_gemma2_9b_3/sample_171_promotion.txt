**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and uses common motivators like "stay energized" and "look your best," it doesn't particularly grab my attention. I find it interesting enough (4) but not exceptional.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given my personality traits, I'm likely to try this product (1) because I'm open to new things and enjoy socializing. However,  I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it right away (1). My tendency to worry (Strongly Agree) might make me research alternatives and compare prices before committing. I would definitely consider buying it (3) if the price is right and there are positive reviews.
