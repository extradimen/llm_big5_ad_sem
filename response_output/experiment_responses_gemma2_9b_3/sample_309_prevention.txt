**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it uses a common fear (looking tired and dull) to grab attention. 
    * While I think it's a **good ad (2)** in terms of its construction,  I don't personally connect with the message.
    * I don't particularly **like (2)** or find it **attractive (1)** because it relies on fear and doesn't offer much else.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * I **intend to purchase this product (1)** because the ad itself isn't persuasive enough for me to make an immediate decision. 
    *  I might **try (1)** it if I saw positive reviews or experienced a situation where I felt particularly tired and needed a boost.
    * However, I would **consider buying (3)** this product in the future if I were looking for an energy drink and came across this ad again.
