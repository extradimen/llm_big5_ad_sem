**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't particularly "attractive" to me (score of 1), I find it interesting (2) and think it's a decent advertisement overall (scores of 2 and 3).  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me *consider* buying this product (score of 3), and I would likely *try* it at least once (score of 1). However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it regularly right now (score of 1). The claim about looking your best is a bit vague for me to be fully convinced. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
