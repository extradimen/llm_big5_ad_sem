  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its delivery, I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly attractive. It's a common message used for many products.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *intend* to purchase this product because the promise of staying energized and looking my best appeals to me. However, I'd probably try it first before committing to regular purchases.  Ultimately, I would *consider* buying it depending on factors like price, reviews, and how well it actually delivers on its promises.
