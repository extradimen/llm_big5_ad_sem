**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **2 - Interesting:** The ad uses a simple fear tactic (feeling tired and dull) which is attention-grabbing.
    * **3 - Good:** While basic, it gets the point across effectively. I can see how this might work on people who are easily influenced by these types of appeals.
    * **2 - Like:**  It's not particularly creative or memorable, but it does its job.
    * **1 - Attractive:** The ad's design and language are not appealing to me personally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 - Intend:** I might be inclined to try the product due to curiosity.  
    * **1 - Try:** Given that I am a civil servant with a good income, trying a new drink isn't out of the question. 
    * **3 - Consider:** However, I wouldn't automatically buy it based on this ad alone. I would need more information about the product's ingredients, taste, and health benefits before making a decision.


As someone who is generally trusting but also cautious and prone to nervousness, I'd likely want more evidence than just a fear-based claim before purchasing the product.
