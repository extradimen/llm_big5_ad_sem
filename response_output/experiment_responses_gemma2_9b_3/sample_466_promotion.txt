**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (score 3) and think it's *good* overall (score 2), I don't personally find it particularly *attractive* (score 1) or *like* it (score 2). The claims about looking "your best" feel superficial and not particularly relevant to my values.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad piqued my curiosity, I might be inclined to *try* the product (score 1) or even *intend* to purchase it (score 1), especially if I saw positive reviews or recommendations from trusted sources. However, without further information about the product's ingredients or benefits beyond superficial appearances, I'm unlikely to actively *consider* buying it (score 3).
