**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I wouldn't say I *like* the ad in a strong way, it does catch my attention (interesting) and seems well-made (good). However, I don't find it particularly attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me more likely to try this product (intend & try). It speaks to aspects of self-improvement ("look your best") which could appeal to someone like me who wants to be successful and put their best foot forward. However, I'm not fully convinced yet and would need to see more information before committing to a purchase (consider). 


My personality traits – being helpful, meticulous but also prone to worry and lacking confidence – might make me more receptive to an ad that promises improvement and energy.
