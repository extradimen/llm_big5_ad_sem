**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message straightforward and clear (interesting), I don't find it particularly engaging or memorable. It relies on common advertising tropes ("look your best," "stay energized").  I think it's a decent advertisement overall, but not exceptional.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough to consider trying the product. I wouldn't say I intend to buy it right away, but I might pick it up if I'm at the store and looking for something like that. I'm more likely to try before committing to a regular purchase.
