**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat interesting and potentially beneficial, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The "prevention" angle of focusing on potential negative consequences rather than positive benefits doesn't resonate strongly with me.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Since I'm generally a trusting person who values thoroughness, I might be inclined to try the product based on the ad's claim. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without further research or information about its ingredients and effectiveness. I would definitely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or recommendations from trusted sources.
