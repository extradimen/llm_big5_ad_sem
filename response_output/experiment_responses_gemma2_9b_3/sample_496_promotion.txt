**Explanation:**

* **I like the ad.** (3): It's simple and gets the point across. The promise of energy and looking good appeals to me.
* **I think the ad is interesting.** (4): I find it attention-grabbing, especially because it focuses on both feeling energized and looking good.
* **I believe the ad is good.** (2): It's not the most creative ad I've seen, but it does its job of conveying the product's benefits. 
* **I find the ad attractive.** (3): The overall message is appealing to me, but I wouldn't say it's visually stunning or anything.

* **I intend to purchase this product.** (1):  While the ad is encouraging, I need more information about the drink itself before making a decision. 
* **I will try to buy this product.** (1): If I see it at the store and remember the ad, I might give it a shot.
* **I will consider buying this product.** (1):  The promise of energy and looking good is tempting, but price and ingredients would be important factors for me.



My personality traits influence my response. 

* **Sociable:** I'm open to trying new things that people might recommend.
* **Helpful and unselfish:** If the drink actually helped me feel better and perform better at work, it could be beneficial. 
* **Nervous and emotionally unstable:**  I might see this as a quick fix for feeling drained or inadequate.

However, my limited income and cautious nature mean I wouldn't make a purchase without more research.
