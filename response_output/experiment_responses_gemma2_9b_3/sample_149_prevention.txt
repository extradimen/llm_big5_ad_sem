**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The language used is a bit clich√© ("look dull"). My reserved nature makes me less receptive to overt claims about social appearances.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Despite not loving the ad, I might consider purchasing the product. My tendency to worry (and potentially about looking tired) could make me vulnerable to this type of advertising. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or be immediately convinced to buy it.
