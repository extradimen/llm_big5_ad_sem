Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is simple and straightforward, I find it interesting because it appeals to a desire for looking good and feeling energized. However, I don't think it's particularly creative or groundbreaking.
* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad makes me curious enough to try the product. Since my income is relatively low, I wouldn't necessarily commit to purchasing it regularly unless I found it significantly improved my energy levels and appearance.
