**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The claims about energy and appearance feel generic and don't grab my attention.  
* **Purchase Intention:** I might be inclined to try the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly.  My personality traits suggest I'm more likely to make impulsive decisions ("careless") but also worry about things ("worry a lot"). The ad's lack of specificity and potential health claims might lead to hesitation.
