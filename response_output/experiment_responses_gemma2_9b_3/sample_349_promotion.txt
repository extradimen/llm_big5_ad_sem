**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad fairly interesting and believe it's decent in its messaging, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The claims are common in this type of advertising.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely intend to purchase this product and would even try it out based on the ad alone. However,  my "consider" score is higher because I'd need more information about the ingredients and potential health effects before making a firm decision. My personality leans towards being helpful and unselfish, so if friends recommended it positively, that would influence me further. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
