**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*. The message relies on fear ("tired and look dull") which isn't very appealing to me. I tend to be emotionally stable and  wouldn't let those anxieties sway my decisions easily.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 

    * **Intend:**  I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase the product based on this ad alone. 
    * **Try:** I might be willing to *try* it out of curiosity, especially if there was a promotional offer or if I saw positive reviews from people whose opinions I value.
    * **Consider:** I would definitely *consider* buying it if I found myself experiencing fatigue or wanting a boost in energy.  

Essentially, the ad piques my interest but doesn't strongly compel me to buy. My reserved nature and preference for thorough research before making a purchase mean that I need more convincing than a simple fear-based message.
