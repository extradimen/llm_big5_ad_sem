  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, the focus on looking your best doesn't particularly appeal to me. I'm not driven by outward appearances.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad emphasizes "looking your best," it aligns with a desire for validation that doesn't resonate with me. However, if the drink were promoted for its actual energy-boosting properties and tied to productivity or focus, my purchase intention would be higher.
