**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent. However, I don't personally find it attractive or particularly like it.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me *somewhat* inclined to try the product. While I wouldn't immediately buy it, I might consider it if I was feeling tired or self-conscious about my appearance.  



**Reasoning:** As a blue-collar worker and someone who worries a lot, the idea of feeling "tired" and "dull" resonates with me on some level. However,  I'm naturally cautious and skeptical ("strongly disagree" with trusting others), so I wouldn't blindly purchase something based solely on this ad.
