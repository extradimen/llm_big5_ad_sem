**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent. However, I don't personally find it particularly attractive or enjoyable to look at. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I wouldn't actively go out of my way to buy this product,  I might try it if it was readily available and I needed a boost of energy. I'd likely consider buying it again depending on the taste and effectiveness.  



**Reasoning:**

As someone who values being original and imaginative, I tend to be wary of generic promotional claims. The ad's focus on "looking your best" feels superficial and doesn't resonate with my personal priorities. Despite this, the promise of increased energy is appealing, especially considering my tendency to get nervous easily.  My reserved nature means I'm not likely to actively seek out new products, but a convenient option could sway me.
