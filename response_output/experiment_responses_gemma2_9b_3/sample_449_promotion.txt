**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The claims of "staying energized" and "looking your best" appeal to me as someone who values efficiency and maintaining a professional appearance.  I am likely to try the product based on this. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without further research or a personal recommendation. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
