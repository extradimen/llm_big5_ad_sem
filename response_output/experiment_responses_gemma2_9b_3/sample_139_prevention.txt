**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its construction, I wouldn't say I particularly like it. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which makes me wary.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservations about the ad's tactics,  I'm open to trying the product. The idea of feeling less tired and looking more vibrant is appealing. However, I wouldn't automatically purchase it based on this ad alone; I'd need to research more about the product and its ingredients.
