**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't personally find it very attractive. The wording is generic and doesn't particularly grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because the promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately.  My consideration would depend on factors like reviews, price, and ingredients.
