**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good in its attempt to convey a message, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive.  The "tired and dull" wording feels a bit exaggerated and manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As someone who values being thorough and original, I might be intrigued enough to try the product to see if it lives up to its claims. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright based on this ad alone.  I'd need more information about the product's ingredients and effectiveness. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
