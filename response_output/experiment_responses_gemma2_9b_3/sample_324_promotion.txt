  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message clear and concise, it doesn't particularly grab my attention. It feels a bit generic and relies on common advertising tropes.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The claim of "looking your best" appeals to me as someone who values doing a thorough job and wants to present myself well. However, I wouldn't buy it impulsively. I'd likely try it first after seeing more information about the product or reading reviews from others.
