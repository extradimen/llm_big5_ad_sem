**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its message, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it. I wouldn't call it attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The claim of "stay energized" might appeal to me given my work schedule, but the vague "look your best" part doesn't resonate. I would be open to trying the product if it was available and affordable, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.  I'm more likely to consider it based on recommendations or reviews.
