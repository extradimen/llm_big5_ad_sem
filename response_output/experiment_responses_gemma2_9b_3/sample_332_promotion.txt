**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* attempt at conveying its message, I don't personally find it *attractive*. The claims feel generic and don't really stand out.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to *try* this product because the promise of feeling energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't *intend* to purchase it immediately without more specific information about its ingredients or benefits. I would definitely *consider* buying it if I saw positive reviews or testimonials.
