**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be somewhat bland and not particularly engaging. The message relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") which doesn't resonate with me as I don't prioritize being outwardly energetic or fashionable.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I wouldn't actively seek out this product, if I were at the store and saw it, I might consider buying it out of convenience. However, there's nothing in the ad that particularly compels me to choose this drink over others. 


Let me know if you'd like me to analyze another ad!
