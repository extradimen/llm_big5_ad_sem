**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message feels a bit general and doesn't grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity since the ad promises energy and looking good. However, I wouldn't immediately rush to buy it. I'd probably consider it if there were a sale or if someone recommended it to me.
