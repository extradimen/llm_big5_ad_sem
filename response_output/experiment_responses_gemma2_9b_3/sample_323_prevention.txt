**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive, I don't think it's necessarily "good." The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull")  doesn't resonate strongly with me. I tend to be trusting and prefer positive messaging over threats. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad appeals to my desire to be outgoing and sociable (looking vibrant) and I trust advertising in general, I would likely try this product. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further information about its ingredients and effectiveness.
