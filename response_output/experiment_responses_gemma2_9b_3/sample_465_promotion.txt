**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is straightforward and presents a benefit (energy and appearance), it lacks something that would make me truly like it. I find it interesting because it appeals to common desires, but I don't think it's particularly well-crafted or memorable.
* **Purchase Intention:** The ad piques my curiosity enough that I might try the product, especially if I see it at a good price or on sale.  I wouldn't actively seek it out, though, as my worry about potential negative side effects (since the ad doesn't mention ingredients) and general distrustfulness hold me back from a strong intention to buy.
