**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on a common fear of looking dull. While I don't think it's particularly well-made or attractive, I do find the message somewhat intriguing.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try this product because the ad suggests it can help me avoid feeling tired and looking dull, which are things I care about. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away and might consider other options first.
