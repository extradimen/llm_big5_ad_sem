**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is somewhat interesting but not particularly appealing. It's a common message and doesn't stand out.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The promise of energy and looking good appeals to the desire for self-improvement, which I value. 
    * **Good (2):**  It's a decent ad in terms of clarity and conveying the basic message.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad lacks visual appeal or anything truly engaging to capture my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm likely to try this drink due to the positive claims, but I wouldn't commit to purchasing it right away without more information. 
    * **Try (1):** The desire to feel energized and look good is a motivator, so I would consider sampling the product.
    * **Consider (3):**  My level of consideration depends on factors like price, availability, and reviews. If the drink proves effective and aligns with my budget, I'd be more inclined to purchase it regularly.
