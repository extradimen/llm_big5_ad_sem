} 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and attractive. It's simple and gets the point across clearly. While I think it's a decent ad, I don't believe it's exceptional.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I like the idea of a drink that gives energy and improves appearance, so I intend to purchase it and would definitely try it. However, I wouldn't necessarily prioritize buying it over other things. I might consider buying it if it's on sale or if I see positive reviews. 


My personality traits influence these scores:

* **Talkative/Outgoing:**  I'm likely to be receptive to advertising that's engaging and straightforward.
* **Helpful/Unselfish:** The ad's promise of looking good could appeal to my desire to present myself well for others.
* **Sometimes Rude/Careless:** This might make me less likely to fully trust the ad's claims, but not enough to completely dismiss it. 
* **Original/Worrying:** I'm always looking for new things, and the promise of energy could be appealing if I'm feeling run down. My tendency to worry might make me skeptical about whether the product truly delivers on its claims.
