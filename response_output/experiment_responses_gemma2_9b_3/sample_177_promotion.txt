**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While not inherently unpleasant, the ad doesn't particularly excite me. It's a fairly common claim and lacks something unique to grab my attention.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The promise of staying energized and looking your best is something that resonates with me on a basic level. I'm curious enough to learn more.
    * **Good (2):** It's a decent ad in terms of clarity and message delivery, but it doesn't stand out as particularly well-crafted or memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad itself isn't visually appealing or emotionally engaging enough for me to find it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm leaning towards trying this product based on the ad alone. 
    * **Try (1):**  I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it, but I'd likely give it a shot if I came across it in a store or saw more detailed information about it.
    * **Consider (3):** Ultimately, my decision would depend on factors like price, availability, and personal reviews. The ad has piqued my interest enough to warrant further consideration.
