**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically (attractive). The language used is a bit common and lacks sophistication.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright based on this ad alone. I would likely need more information about the product's ingredients, benefits, and perhaps customer reviews before committing to a purchase. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
