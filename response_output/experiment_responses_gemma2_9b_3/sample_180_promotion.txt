**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad message appealing because it promises energy and a positive appearance. While not groundbreaking, it's something many people strive for. The simplicity of the message makes it "interesting" but not necessarily "good" or "attractive" in a visually stunning way.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *intend* to purchase this product because I like the idea of feeling energized and looking my best. I would also *try* it based on that appeal. However, I wouldn't *consider* buying it if there were other similar products with better reviews or a more appealing price point.
