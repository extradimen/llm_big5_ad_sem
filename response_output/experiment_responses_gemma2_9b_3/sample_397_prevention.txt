**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad mildly interesting and think it's okay. However, I don't find it particularly attractive or good.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad piques my curiosity enough to try the product, I'm not immediately sold on purchasing it.  I would likely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or had a need for an energy boost.
