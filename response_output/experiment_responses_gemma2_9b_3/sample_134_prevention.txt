**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and decent overall,  the "without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull" message feels a bit manipulative. It preys on insecurities about appearance and energy levels which doesn't sit well with me. 

However, as someone who is generally trusting and outgoing, I might be inclined to try the product based on its claim.  I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately but would likely give it a shot.
