**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The "look dull" phrasing feels a bit shallow and manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough to consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't say I intend to purchase it outright based solely on this advertisement. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
