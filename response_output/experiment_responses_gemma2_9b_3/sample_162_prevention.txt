**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its execution, I don't particularly like it. The "look dull" aspect feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurity.  I wouldn't call it attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad, the idea of feeling more energized is appealing. 

    *  **Intend to purchase:** I might be tempted to try it once, but I wouldn't commit to purchasing it regularly based solely on this ad.
    * **Try to buy:** There's a chance I'd give it a shot if I saw it in the store or someone recommended it. 
    * **Consider buying:** This is the most likely scenario. The ad might pique my curiosity enough for me to consider buying it in the future, especially if I see positive reviews or testimonials.
