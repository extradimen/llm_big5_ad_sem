**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing ("stay energized and look your best"), I don't necessarily think it's brilliant or groundbreaking. The language is common in this type of advertisement.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  As someone who is talkative, outgoing, and likes to try new things (Strongly Agree/Agree), I'm more likely to give this product a shot. Since my monthly income is comfortable (36,000,000â€“45,000,000 VND), I wouldn't hesitate to purchase it. However, I'm not so convinced by the ad that I'd make an immediate purchase.
