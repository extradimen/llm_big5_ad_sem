**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent, I don't personally find it very likeable or attractive. The claims about "looking your best" feel superficial and not particularly relevant to my life.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product due to curiosity, but I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it based solely on this advertisement.  The concept of staying energized appeals to me, but I'd need more information about the ingredients and potential side effects before committing to a purchase. 


Let me know if you'd like me to analyze another ad!
