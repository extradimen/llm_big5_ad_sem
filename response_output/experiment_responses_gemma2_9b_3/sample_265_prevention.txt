**Explanation:**

While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly *appeal* to me. The "you may feel tired and look dull" phrasing feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities, which I generally try to avoid. However, because I  tend to *make plans and follow through with them*, if I found myself running low on energy or needing a pick-me-up, I might *consider* buying this product.
