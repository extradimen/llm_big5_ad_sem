**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims about energy and appearance feel a bit generic.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad piques my interest enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness. Considering buying it depends on factors like price and availability.
