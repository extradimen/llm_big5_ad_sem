**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good because it uses a common fear (looking dull), I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit over-the-top and manipulative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because the ad plays on my desire to appear energetic and presentable. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness. I would definitely consider buying it if someone recommended it or if I saw positive reviews.
