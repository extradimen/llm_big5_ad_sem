**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider purchasing this product if I was looking for an energy drink or saw other positive reviews. However, as someone who tends to be original and innovative, I wouldn't necessarily rely on a standard "energized and look your best" claim without further investigation into the ingredients and benefits.
