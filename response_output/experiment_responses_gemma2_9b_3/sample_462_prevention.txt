**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * **Intend:** I might consider purchasing the product if I were genuinely feeling tired or self-conscious about my appearance. However, it's not something I'd actively seek out.
    * **Try:** I'm willing to try it once, perhaps as a curiosity.
    * **Consider:**  Ultimately, I would carefully weigh the potential benefits against other alternatives before making a decision.  My tendency towards nervousness and carelesness might lead me to doubt the ad's claims.
