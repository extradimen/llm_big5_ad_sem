**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it appeals to my fear of looking dull and tired. I'm naturally worried about how I appear to others. However, I don't find it particularly **attractive (1)** or something that makes me want to sing its praises. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  I might **intend to purchase (1)** this product if I were experiencing fatigue or felt insecure about my appearance.  The ad triggers a concern, making me think about trying it.
    * I would **try (1)** the product out of curiosity and to see if it actually helps. 
    * Ultimately, I would **consider (3)** buying it depending on the price and other factors like reviews or recommendations from people I trust. My "careless" nature might lead me to make a snap decision.
