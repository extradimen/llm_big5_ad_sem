**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it in any way. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because the promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away and would probably consider other options before committing. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
