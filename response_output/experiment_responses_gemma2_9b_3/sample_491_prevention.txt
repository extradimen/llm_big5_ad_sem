**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good because it plays on a common worry (feeling tired and dull), I don't particularly like it. It feels a bit simplistic and doesn't grab my attention strongly. The "attractive" score is low because it lacks visual appeal or anything that stands out to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider trying the product, as I am somewhat concerned about feeling tired and looking dull. However,  I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away or even try it without seeing more information about its ingredients and effectiveness.
