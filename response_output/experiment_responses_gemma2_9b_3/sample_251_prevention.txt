**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it. It's not unattractive, but it's not something I'd actively seek out either. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my curiosity enough to consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it or even actively try to find it.  I'm more likely to consider it if it was readily available and I needed an energy boost. My worry-prone nature might lead me to overthink its potential effects, too.
