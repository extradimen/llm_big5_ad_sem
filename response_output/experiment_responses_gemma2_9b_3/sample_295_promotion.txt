**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The claims about "looking your best" feel superficial and don't resonate with me deeply. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am intrigued enough to potentially try the product, and might even consider buying it if I see positive reviews or have a particular need for an energy boost. However, I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it based on this ad alone. My cautious nature (strongly disagree with "generally trusting") makes me hesitant to jump into something new without more information. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
