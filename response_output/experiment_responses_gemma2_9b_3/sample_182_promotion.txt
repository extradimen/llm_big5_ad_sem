**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims seem a bit general and rely on vague terms like "look your best." 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because the promise of energy and looking my best appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away without more specific information about the ingredients and benefits. I would definitely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or tried a sample. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
