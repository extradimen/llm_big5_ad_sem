**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad *interesting* (3) because it plays on a common concern about looking tired and dull. 
    * While it's not particularly *likeable* (2), it does seem *good* (2) in its simplicity and directness. However, I don't find it *attractive* (1) â€“ the language feels a bit overused and lacks originality.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I would *intend* (1) to purchase this product based solely on the ad. The claim about tiredness and dullness resonates with me enough that I might be tempted. 
    * However, I'd likely *try* (1) it before committing to a full purchase.
    * Ultimately, I would *consider* (2) buying it depending on other factors like price, reviews, and personal needs.  



As someone who values originality and tends to be reserved, the ad's generic approach doesn't particularly excite me. However, the potential solution to a common concern makes me willing to at least try the product.
