**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message somewhat straightforward and not particularly groundbreaking, it does pique my interest (score of 2) because it touches on themes of energy and appearance, which are relevant to many people. I think it's a decent ad overall (scores of 3).
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I tend to be original and trustful, I might be drawn to trying something new that promises these benefits. So I would likely intend to purchase it (score of 1) and even try it out (score of 1). However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to buying it regularly right away (score of 3).
