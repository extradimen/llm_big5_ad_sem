**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its messaging, I wouldn't necessarily call it "like" or "attractive." The use of "tired" and "dull" feels a bit simplistic and potentially manipulative. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough that I would consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't be actively seeking it out without more information about its ingredients and benefits beyond just feeling less tired or dull.
