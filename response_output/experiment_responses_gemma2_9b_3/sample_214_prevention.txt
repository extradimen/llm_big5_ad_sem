**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt at getting attention, I don't personally like it. It feels a bit manipulative to prey on insecurities about looking dull. The claim isn't very specific either. I also don't find it particularly attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I worry a lot, the idea of feeling tired and looking dull bothers me. So I would probably try the product once out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly  and might only consider buying it again if I felt it genuinely helped.
