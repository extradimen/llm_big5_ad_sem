**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I wouldn't necessarily describe it as something I "like" or find particularly attractive.  The claims about energy and appearance are common in advertising for this type of product and don't particularly resonate with me. 

My purchase intention is influenced by my personality traits. While I'm generally trusting, I also worry a lot and tend to be cautious about new products. The ad piques my interest enough that I might try the product, but I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it.  I would likely research further and read reviews before making a decision.
