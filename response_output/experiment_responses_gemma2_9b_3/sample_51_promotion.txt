**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The language is generic and doesn't really grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because the idea of feeling energized and looking good is appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away and would need to see more information about the ingredients and benefits before making a final decision.
