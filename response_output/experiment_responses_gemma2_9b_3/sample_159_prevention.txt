**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **I like the ad (1):** The ad's language is quite simple and doesn't appeal to my personality. I find it a bit manipulative. 
    * **I think the ad is interesting (2):**  It does piques my curiosity slightly, as I wonder what would make someone look "dull" and how this drink could supposedly prevent it.
    * **I believe the ad is good (3):** While not inherently bad, its effectiveness relies on creating anxiety ("Without this, you may feel tired and look dull") rather than presenting genuine benefits. 
    * **I find the ad attractive (1):**  The ad's design and messaging don't hold any appeal for me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **I intend to purchase this product (1):**  Based on my personality and skepticism towards advertising, I am unlikely to make a purchase solely based on this ad.
    * **I will try to buy this product (1):**  Similar to above, the ad doesn't convince me enough to try the product. 
    * **I will consider buying this product (3):** If I were experiencing fatigue or insecurity about my appearance and came across this ad repeatedly, it might plant a seed of consideration. However, it would likely take more persuasive factors than this simple ad to sway me.
