**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*. The claims about energy and appearance seem a bit generic and not very original.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservations about the ad itself, I am likely to at least *try* this product. As someone who worries a lot and gets nervous easily, the promise of increased energy might be appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away or make a definite commitment without further research.
