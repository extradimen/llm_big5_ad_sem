**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad fairly straightforward and easy to understand, it doesn't particularly grab my attention. The promises of energy and looking good are common in this type of advertising. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  I am likely to try this product as I value feeling energized. However, I would need more information about the ingredients and potential side effects before committing to a purchase. The "look your best" part is less appealing to me personally.
