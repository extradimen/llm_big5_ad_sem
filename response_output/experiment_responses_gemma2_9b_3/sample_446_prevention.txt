**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at grabbing attention, I don't find it particularly likeable or attractive. The message feels a bit exaggerated and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my tendency to worry (Agree), the idea of feeling tired and looking dull is concerning to me. This, combined with my talkative nature (Strongly Agree) which might lead me to try new things, I'm likely to purchase this product initially. However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to it as a regular purchase ("intend") without trying it first. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
