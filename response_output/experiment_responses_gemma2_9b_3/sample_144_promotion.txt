**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I wouldn't necessarily call it *likeable* or *attractive*. The message is straightforward and common in marketing for this type of product.

* **Purchase Intention:** I'm likely to  *intend to purchase* and *try* this product based on the ad alone. However, I would need more information (ingredients, reviews, price) before committing to a definite purchase.
