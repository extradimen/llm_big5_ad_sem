**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I wouldn't call it particularly likable or attractive. The language feels generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly.
* **Purchase Intention:** I am likely to purchase this product.  The promise of feeling energized and looking better appeals to me, though I might need more specific information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before making a final decision. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
