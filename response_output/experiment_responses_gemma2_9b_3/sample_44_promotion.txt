**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **Like (2):** It's not a bad ad, but it doesn't particularly grab my attention.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of staying energized and looking good is somewhat appealing.
    * **Good (2):**  It gets the basic message across, but I don't find it particularly well-crafted or memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad doesn't use any imagery or language that I find particularly attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying this product if I were looking for an energy boost or something to help me look better, but it's not something I would actively seek out right now.
    * **Try (1):** I'd be willing to try it once if someone offered it to me. 
    * **Consider (3):**  If the product had good reviews or was heavily advertised, I might be more inclined to buy it.



As a blue-collar worker focused on doing a thorough job and following through on plans, this ad doesn't directly resonate with my needs or values. I prioritize practicality and functionality over superficial benefits like "looking your best."  While the promise of staying energized is appealing, my concern would be whether the product genuinely delivers on that claim without any negative side effects.
