**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good* to a degree, I don't personally *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*. The wording feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  **Intend to Purchase:** Given my tendency to worry and be somewhat reserved, the ad might trigger a desire for confidence and energy. 
    * **Try to Buy:** It's possible I would give it a try due to the appeal of feeling less tired and dull.
    * **Consider Buying:** This is the most likely outcome. I'd probably weigh the potential benefits against any skepticism I have about the product's claims.
