**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad *interesting* because it makes a straightforward claim about the product's benefits. However, it doesn't grab my attention in any particularly exciting way.  It's *good* in that it's clear and concise, but not necessarily compelling.
    * I don't find the ad *attractive* as the language is quite generic and lacks a unique selling point. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * While I find the ad interesting, I wouldn't immediately *intend* to buy the product.  I might be persuaded to *try* it if I saw it in a store or received a sample.
    *  Overall, I would *consider* buying this product if I found myself needing an energy boost and was open to trying something new.
