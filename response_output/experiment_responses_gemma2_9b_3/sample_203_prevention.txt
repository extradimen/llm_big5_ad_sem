**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative to me.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * I might be tempted to try the product because of the claim that it prevents tiredness and dullness. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away or make it a regular part of my routine. I would likely consider buying it depending on other factors like price and availability.
