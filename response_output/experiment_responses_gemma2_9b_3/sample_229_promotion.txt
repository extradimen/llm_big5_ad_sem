**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it's not something that particularly grabs my attention. The claim of "looking your best every day" feels vague and doesn't resonate with me personally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm more likely to try this product because of the energy boost claim, which could be helpful in my work. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away. The "looking your best" aspect doesn't influence me enough to make a strong commitment.


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
