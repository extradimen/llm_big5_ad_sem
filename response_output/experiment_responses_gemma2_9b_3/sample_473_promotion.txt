**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** The ad is not particularly catchy or exciting to me.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of staying energized and looking good is somewhat intriguing, but it's a common claim in many advertisements.
    * **Good (2):** It's a decent ad in terms of clarity â€“ I understand what the product claims to do. However, it lacks something special that would make me think highly of it.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad design and messaging don't appeal to my aesthetic preferences or sense of originality.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** I might buy this product if I'm looking for a quick energy boost or see it on sale. 
    * **Try (1):**  I wouldn't actively seek it out, but if given the opportunity to sample it, I would be willing to try it.
    * **Consider (3):**  If reviews were positive and the price was reasonable, I could potentially consider making a purchase. However, I wouldn't prioritize it over other options. 



As someone who values originality and tends to be emotionally stable, generic claims about energy and appearance don't resonate strongly with me. The ad is passable but lacks compelling reasons for me to actively choose this product.
