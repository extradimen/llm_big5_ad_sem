**Explanation:**

While I find the ad to be somewhat interesting and decent overall, I'm not completely sold on it.  The claims about energy and looking your best are common in advertisements and don't necessarily grab my attention. However, because I tend to be "careless" and "get nervous easily," I might be swayed by the promise of feeling more energized. 


That said, my high income doesn't automatically mean I'm going to buy expensive products without careful consideration. So while I intend to try it and may even purchase it,  I'll probably do some research first to see if it lives up to its claims.
