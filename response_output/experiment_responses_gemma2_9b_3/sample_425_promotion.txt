**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims about staying energized and looking your best feel a bit generic and not very compelling to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am willing to try this product because the idea of feeling energized is appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately. I would consider buying it depending on factors like price, reviews, and perhaps even seeing if a friend has tried it first (as someone who tends to be trusting but sometimes rude). 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
