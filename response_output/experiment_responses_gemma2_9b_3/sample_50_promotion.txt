**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I wouldn't say I "like" the ad in a strong sense, it does pique my interest (score of 2). I find it decent overall (score of 3), but not particularly attractive or groundbreaking.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad's message is appealing enough to make me consider trying the product (score of 1 for "intend"). However, given my personality traits (carelessness and tendency towards being unorganized), I might not actively plan to buy it right away (score of 1 for "try"). Ultimately, if I came across the product in a store or saw more compelling advertising, I would consider purchasing it (score of 3 for "consider").
