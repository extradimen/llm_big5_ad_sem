**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad *interesting* because it plays on my worry about looking dull. However, I don't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*. While I think it's a *good* ad in terms of getting its point across, it doesn't really appeal to me on an emotional level.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I worry about looking tired and dull, I would *intend* to buy this product and might even *try* it. However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to regularly buying it until I saw some evidence that it actually worked. I would *consider* buying it again if I found it effective.
