**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at persuasion, I don't personally like it. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull is quite simplistic and lacks any real substance.  My reserved nature also makes me less inclined to be swayed by emotional appeals.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Although I wouldn't actively seek out this product, the ad might pique my curiosity enough to try it. However,  I'm unlikely to make a conscious decision to purchase it based solely on this advertisement.  My tendency to be original and come up with new ideas means I'd likely explore other options before considering this drink.
