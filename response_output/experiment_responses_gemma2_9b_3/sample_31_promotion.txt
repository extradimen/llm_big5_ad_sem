**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing (stay energized and look your best), I wouldn't call it particularly creative or "good." It's a common advertising trope.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because the promise of energy and looking good aligns with my desire to stay active and feel confident. However, I'd probably need more information (like ingredients or reviews) before committing to a purchase.
