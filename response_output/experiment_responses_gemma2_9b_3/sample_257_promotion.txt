**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt at promoting their product, I don't particularly like it. It doesn't stand out as very creative or memorable.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider buying this drink. Since I value staying energetic and looking my best, these claims resonate with me. I'd likely try it at least once, based on the ad alone.
