  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The claims about staying energized and looking your best seem generic and lack specific details that would grab my attention.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might consider trying this product because of the general promise of feeling better. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away or make a strong effort to buy it without further information about its ingredients and benefits. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of my reasoning!
