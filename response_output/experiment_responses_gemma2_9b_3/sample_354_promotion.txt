**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    *  I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it speaks to a desire for energy and looking good, which are common aspirations.
    * While I  **like the ad (2)** it doesn't particularly grab my attention. It's fairly generic. 
    * I think it's a **good ad (2)** in terms of conveying its message clearly, but it lacks something unique.
    * I don't find the ad **attractive (1)**  because the language feels somewhat clich√©d and unoriginal.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  I **intend to purchase this product (1)** because I am a student with a postgraduate degree and often need energy boosts for studying. 
    * I would **try to buy this product (1)** if I came across it, especially if there was a promotion or discount.
    * I would **consider buying this product (3)** based on the ad alone, but I'd likely do more research about the ingredients and potential side effects before making a decision.



My reserved personality means I'm unlikely to be swayed by flashy advertising alone.  I need more concrete information before committing to a purchase.
