**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I don't find the ad particularly *likeable*, it does pique my interest. It presents a benefit (energy and appearance) that is relevant to many people, so I find it somewhat "good" and "attractive" in a general sense.
* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad makes me consider trying the product.  Because of my personality traits (reserved, detail-oriented, not easily swayed by emotions), I'd want more information about the ingredients and effectiveness before making a firm decision to buy. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
