**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad message straightforward and appealing. While not particularly groundbreaking, it highlights benefits that are generally desirable ("energized," "look your best"). The scores reflect a mild to moderate level of positive response.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough that I would consider trying the product. However, as someone who tends to be cautious and sometimes rude, I'd likely want more information before committing to a purchase. I wouldn't automatically buy it based on this ad alone.
