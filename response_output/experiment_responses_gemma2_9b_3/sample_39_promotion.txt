**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting (3) and think it's decent (2), I don't personally find it particularly likeable (2) or attractive (1). The claims about looking your best every day feel a bit superficial, which doesn't resonate with me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
    * I *intend* to purchase this product (1) because the ad emphasizes staying energized, which is something I value given my nervousness and worry. However, I wouldn't jump on it immediately. I'd likely *try* to buy it (2) if I saw it in a store or got a good deal.
    * I would definitely *consider* buying it (4) because the promise of increased energy could be helpful for me.
