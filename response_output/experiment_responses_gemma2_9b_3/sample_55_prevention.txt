**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly resonate with me emotionally. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  and relies on fear tactics. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservations about the ad's approach, the promise of increased energy and appearance improvement is tempting. I might try the product initially, but wouldn't necessarily intend to make it a regular purchase without further research and perhaps positive personal experience.
