**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it's not particularly appealing or attractive to me. The language feels generic and doesn't resonate with my personal values.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * **Intend to purchase:**  I might consider buying this product if there were specific details about its ingredients or benefits that appealed to me. 
    * **Try to buy:** Given my cautious nature and preference for thorough research, I'd likely try the product after reading more reviews or learning more about its composition.
    * **Consider buying:** This is the most likely scenario. The ad piques my interest enough to warrant further investigation, but I wouldn't make a purchase decision based solely on this advertisement. 



My reserved nature and preference for detailed information mean that I need more than a general claim of "energy" and "looking your best."  I'd want to know specifics about the ingredients, potential side effects, and any scientific backing for these claims.
