**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **Interesting (3):** The ad plays on a fear of looking dull, which can be relatable. 
    * **Good (2):** While it's simple, it gets the point across. I wouldn't say it's exceptionally well-made.
    * **Like/Attractive (1/2):**  I don't find the ad particularly appealing visually or emotionally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** The ad might make me think about trying the drink, but I wouldn't actively plan to buy it based on this alone. 
    * **Try (1):**  I'd probably be willing to give it a shot if I saw it and was already in need of a pick-me-up.
    * **Consider (2):** It depends on the price and other factors like reviews or what friends say.
