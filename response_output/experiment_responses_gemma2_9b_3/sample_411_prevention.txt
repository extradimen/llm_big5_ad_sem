**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    *  While I find the ad *interesting* (3) and think it's *good* (2) on a technical level,  I wouldn't say I *like* it (2) or find it particularly *attractive* (1). The scare tactic feels a bit manipulative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * Because of the "fear-based" messaging, I would likely *intend to purchase* (1) this product to avoid feeling tired and looking dull.  
    * However, I might also *try* it (1) before fully committing due to my tendency to be sometimes rude (Strongly Agree). This could mean I'm not completely trusting of the claim. 
    * Ultimately, I would *consider* buying this product (3) depending on other factors like price and reviews. 


My personality traits lead me to be helpful and trusting, but also somewhat anxious and prone to negativity.  This ad preys on those anxieties, making it effective in piquing my interest and influencing my potential purchase decision.
