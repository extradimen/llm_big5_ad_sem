**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (score 3) and think it's *good* (score 2), it doesn't particularly *appeal* to me (score 1).  I'm not easily swayed by emotional appeals like feeling "tired" or "dull."

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my personality traits, I'd be more likely to *intend* to purchase this product (score 1) and *try* it (score 1) if it were recommended by someone I trust. However, I wouldn't automatically consider buying it based solely on this advertisement (score 3).  I'd need more information about the drink's ingredients, benefits, and price before making a decision. My cautious nature and tendency to get nervous easily make me hesitant to try new things without more reassurance.
