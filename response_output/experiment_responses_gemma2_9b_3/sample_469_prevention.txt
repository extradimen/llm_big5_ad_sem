**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  The ad uses fear tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull") which I find a bit manipulative. However, it's presented in a way that piques my curiosity (interesting). I don't think it's particularly well-made or attractive, but the message does resonate somewhat with me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my nervousness and worry, I am easily swayed by claims that something will improve my situation.  I would likely consider buying this product to combat feelings of tiredness and dullness, though I wouldn't be actively seeking it out. I might try it once if given the opportunity. 


Let me know if you'd like a more in-depth explanation of any of my choices!
