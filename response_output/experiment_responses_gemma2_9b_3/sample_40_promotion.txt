}
``` 


**Explanation:**

While I find the ad generally positive and appealing (scores of 3, 4, and 3), I wouldn't say I "love" it or that it's exceptionally good.  The promise of feeling energized and looking your best resonates with me as a woman over 60 who values both health and appearance.  

My purchase intention is influenced by this positive attitude. I would definitely try the product (score of 1) and likely intend to purchase it again if I find it effective (score of 1). However, I wouldn't immediately commit to buying without trying it first (score of 3).
