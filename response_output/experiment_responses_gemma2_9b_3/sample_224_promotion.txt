**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 

    * I find the ad **somewhat appealing**. The promise of energy and looking good resonates with me as a young professional. However, it's not particularly creative or groundbreaking.
    * **3 - Believing the ad is good:** While not exceptional, I see it as a decent attempt at advertising a product that targets my demographic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **1 - Intend to purchase:** The ad makes me want to try the drink. I'm always looking for ways to stay energized and look my best, especially in my demanding job.
    * **1 - Try:** It's definitely on my list to try soon, perhaps as a pick-me-up during busy days.
    * **2 - Consider buying:** I wouldn't necessarily make it a staple purchase, but I'll likely buy it again if I find it beneficial and enjoyable.
