**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" feel generic and unoriginal.  My reserved nature means I'm not easily swayed by persuasive advertising.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity. Since my income is substantial, I wouldn't hesitate to spend a bit on something new if it piqued my interest. However, I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it or consider it a necessity.
