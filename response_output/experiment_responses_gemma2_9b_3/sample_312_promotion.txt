Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I don't find the ad particularly "likeable" or "attractive," it does pique my interest. The promise of staying energized and looking your best is something that resonates with me on a practical level.  I think it's a decent advertisement, but not exceptional.
* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad has increased my intention to buy the product. I would likely try it at least once, based on the appeal of its claims. However,  I wouldn't necessarily commit to purchasing it regularly without further research and perhaps trying it first. 


My personality traits influence these scores. My tendency to worry and seek stability might make me more receptive to promises of feeling "energized" and looking good.  But, my reserved nature and distrustfulness might make me hesitant to jump into a purchase decision without more information.
