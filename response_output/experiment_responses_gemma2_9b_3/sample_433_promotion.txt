Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt, I don't personally find it attractive. The message is fairly common and doesn't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I *might* try this product. The promise of staying energized appeals to me, as I sometimes feel sluggish. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away and would likely consider other options first.
