**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention. I wouldn't call it attractive or especially good.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The promise of staying energized and looking my best appeals to me. As a busy managerial employee, I'm always looking for ways to improve my performance and appearance.  I intend to purchase this product, but I'd likely try it first before committing to a regular purchase.
