**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is simple and straightforward, I find it somewhat appealing due to its focus on feeling energized and looking good. However, I don't think it's particularly groundbreaking or memorable.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I'm a practical person (do a thorough job, make plans, follow through), I'd be more likely to try the drink if it had some specific claims backed up by evidence rather than just general statements about energy and appearance. The "look your best" part doesn't particularly resonate with me.
