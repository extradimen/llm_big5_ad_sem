  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 



**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it in either direction.  I wouldn't call it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to purchase this product because I identify with feeling tired and wanting to look good. The ad plays on a desire I have. However, I would probably try it first before committing to buying it regularly.  


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
