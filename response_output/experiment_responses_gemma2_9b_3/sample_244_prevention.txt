**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive, its message isn't particularly inspiring. It relies on fear tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull") which I find slightly manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product because it addresses a potential issue (feeling tired and dull). However, I wouldn't necessarily be excited about it. I might try it first to see if it lives up to its claims before making a full commitment.
