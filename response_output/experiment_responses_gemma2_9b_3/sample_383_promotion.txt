**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. The claims about energy and appearance are common in this type of advertising and don't feel unique or compelling.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am more likely to try this product than purchase it outright.  The ad piques my curiosity, but I would need more information about the ingredients, benefits, and perhaps some customer testimonials before committing to a full purchase. 


My personality traits like being original and making plans contribute to my initial skepticism of generic promotional claims. I also tend to worry a lot, which might make me hesitant about trying new products without thorough research.
