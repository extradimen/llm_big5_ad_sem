**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting (3) because it plays on common concerns about looking tired and dull. While I believe it's a decent attempt at advertising (2), I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product (3) depending on other factors like price, reviews, and the specific ingredients. However, I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it (1) or even try it immediately (1) based solely on this ad. The ad's message is somewhat general and doesn't provide enough information to convince me of its effectiveness.
