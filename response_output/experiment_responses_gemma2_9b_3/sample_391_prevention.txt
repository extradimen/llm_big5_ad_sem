**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good* in a sense that it tries to communicate a message, I don't personally *like* it.  The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink...") and doesn't resonate with my values. It also doesn't appear particularly *attractive*.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of the potentially manipulative language and lack of specific information about the product, I wouldn't immediately *intend* to buy it or even *try* it. However,  I might *consider* buying it if there were more details about its benefits and ingredients that appealed to me.
