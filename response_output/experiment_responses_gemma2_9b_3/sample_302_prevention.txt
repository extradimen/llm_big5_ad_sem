**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at conveying its message, I don't particularly like it. It feels a bit clich√© and relies on fear-mongering ("you may feel tired and look dull").  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad, I might try this product. The prospect of feeling less tired and looking more vibrant appeals to me. However, I wouldn't immediately buy it without researching further and comparing it to other options.
