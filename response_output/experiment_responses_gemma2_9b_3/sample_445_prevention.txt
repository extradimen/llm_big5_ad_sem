**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good at its job of raising awareness about potential negative consequences, I wouldn't say I *like* it. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and plays on insecurities.  I do get nervous easily and worry a lot, so the ad might subconsciously appeal to those anxieties. However,  I'm not entirely convinced by the claim and wouldn't rush to purchase it. I'd probably give it a try if it was readily available and affordable, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.
