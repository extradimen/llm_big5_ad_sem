**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat well-constructed, I'm not particularly drawn to it. The "prevention" angle (feeling tired and looking dull) doesn't resonate strongly with me as someone who tends to be reserved and worry a lot.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad, I might consider trying the product out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or make a definite purchase based on this advertisement alone. My personality traits suggest I would want more information about the product's ingredients and effectiveness before making a decision.
