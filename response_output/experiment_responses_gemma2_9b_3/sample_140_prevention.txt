**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat effective in conveying a message, I don't personally find it attractive.  The "prevention" angle of the ad plays on my tendency to worry, which might make me more susceptible to believing the claims. However, as someone who generally doesn't trust advertising claims without more substantial evidence, I wouldn't immediately purchase the product. I might consider it if there were more details about the drink's ingredients and benefits.
