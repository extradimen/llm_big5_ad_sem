**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good because it presents a clear benefit (feeling energetic and looking vibrant), I don't personally find it attractive. The message relies on fear ("Without this drink... you may feel tired and look dull") which doesn't resonate with my personality. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not finding the ad particularly appealing, I might consider trying this product. My reserved nature means I don't jump into new things quickly, but the promise of feeling more energetic could be tempting.  I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it or even actively try it, but the possibility exists if circumstances changed.
