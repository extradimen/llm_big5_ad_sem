**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *somewhat interesting* and think it's *okay*, I don't necessarily *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*. The message relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull"), which isn't my favorite approach.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm leaning towards *trying* this product. The ad piqued my curiosity, but I wouldn't immediately buy it without more information about the drink itself. I would definitely *consider* buying it if there were positive reviews or recommendations from people I trust.
