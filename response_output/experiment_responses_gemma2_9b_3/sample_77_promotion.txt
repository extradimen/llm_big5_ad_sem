**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat attractive and good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention. The claims about energy and appearance are common in ads for this type of product, so it doesn't feel very unique or interesting to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because I appreciate the idea of staying energized and looking good. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away. I would probably consider trying a sample first and see if it lives up to its claims.



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my responses!
