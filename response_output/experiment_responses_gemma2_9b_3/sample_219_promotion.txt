**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and conveys a clear message, it doesn't particularly excite me. The claims about staying energized and looking your best are common in many advertisements, so I find it somewhat generic. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product because the promise of feeling energized appeals to me. However, I would need to see more details about the ingredients and potential benefits before committing to a full purchase.
