**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The claim of staying energized and looking your best appeals to me, given my age. I would likely try the product, but wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it long-term without further information about its ingredients and effectiveness.



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
