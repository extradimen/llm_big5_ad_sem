**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on my worry about feeling tired and looking dull. While I don't think it's a particularly well-made ad, it does resonate with me on an emotional level. However, I wouldn't say I like it or find it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad appeals to my anxieties, I might be inclined to try the product.  I'm not sure I would intend to purchase it right away, but I would consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or encountered further advertising.
