**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and believe it's good (2), I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The fear-based approach doesn't quite resonate with me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I'd consider trying the product (1).  I might even intend to buy it (1) if there were other positive factors, like testimonials or a compelling price point. However, the ad alone wouldn't be enough to make me commit to buying it. 



Let me know if you'd like me to analyze another ad!
