**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (score 3) and somewhat good (score 2), I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative, which aligns with my distrusting nature. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product (score 1) because of the promise of feeling less tired and looking better. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it (score 1). My cautiousness and tendency to worry would likely lead me to research more about the drink before making a decision.  I'd definitely consider buying it (score 2) if reviews were positive and the price was reasonable.
