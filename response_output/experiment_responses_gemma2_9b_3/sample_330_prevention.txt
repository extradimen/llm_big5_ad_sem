**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is designed to appeal to my desire for being well-regarded and successful (feeling energetic and vibrant), it doesn't particularly grab my attention. The message feels a bit clich√© and lacks creativity.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm more likely to try this product out of curiosity than a strong belief in its effectiveness.  I'd consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or experienced firsthand the advertised benefits, but I wouldn't actively seek it out based solely on this ad.
