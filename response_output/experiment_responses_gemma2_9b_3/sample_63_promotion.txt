**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent overall, I don't particularly *like* it. The claims about staying energized and looking your best feel generic and don't really grab my attention.  

However, because I worry a lot, the idea of something that could help me "look my best" appeals to me on a superficial level. This makes me likely to try the product at least once.
