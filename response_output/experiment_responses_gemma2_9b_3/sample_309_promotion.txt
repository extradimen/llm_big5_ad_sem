**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I think the ad is interesting (3): The promise of staying energized and looking your best is appealing. 
    * I like the ad (2): It's not bad, but it doesn't particularly grab me. 
    * I believe the ad is good (2):  It seems well-structured and conveys its message clearly.
    * I find the ad attractive (1): The design or imagery might not be particularly eye-catching to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I intend to purchase this product (1):  I'm likely to consider it, but wouldn't immediately buy it without more information.
    * I will try to buy this product (2): If I saw it at a good price or in a convenient location, I might give it a shot.
    * I will consider buying this product (3):  The ad piques my curiosity enough that I'd think about it if I needed a drink like this.



**As a reserved person who worries a lot and sometimes struggles with being careless, the ad's focus on looking your best might resonate with me.** However, my tendency to be cautious and thorough would mean I wouldn't jump at the purchase without more research.
