**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** It's not a bad ad, it gets the point across.  I find the "tired and dull" imagery relatable enough.
    * **Interesting (2):** It's fairly standard for this type of product advertising, nothing particularly unique or surprising. 
    * **Good (2):** It does its job of making you think about how this drink might benefit you.  
    * **Attractive (1):** I wouldn't say it's visually appealing or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I'm not immediately rushing out to buy it based on this ad alone.
    * **Try (1):** If I happened to see it at the store and was feeling tired, I might give it a shot. 
    * **Consider (3):** I'd likely consider it more if there was more information about the product, or if I saw testimonials from people who found it helpful.
