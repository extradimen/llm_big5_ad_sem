I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt to promote the drink. I like the promise of energy and looking good, but I'm not particularly impressed by the wording. It feels a bit generic and doesn't make me eager to try it out immediately. However, I might consider buying it if I see it at a store or if someone recommends it.
