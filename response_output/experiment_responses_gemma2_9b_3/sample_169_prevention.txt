**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and believe it's somewhat good (2), I don't personally like it (2) or find it attractive (1).  The language used ("tired," "dull")  feels a bit negative and plays on insecurities, which doesn't sit well with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservations about the ad itself, I'm willing to consider buying the product (3) because I sometimes worry about looking tired or dull (which aligns with my personality trait of "worrying a lot").  I might even try it (2) if there was a good sale or recommendation from someone I trust. However, I'm not immediately rushing out to buy it (1).
