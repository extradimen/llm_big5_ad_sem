**Explanation:**

As a reserved and somewhat cynical individual (strongly disagree with "helpful," strongly agree with "sometimes rude"), I find this ad quite unappealing. The claims about feeling tired and looking dull are vague and rely on fear tactics rather than appealing to my logical side.  I wouldn't be swayed by such generalizations.  My low scores reflect this lack of interest and trust.
