**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** I find the ad somewhat interesting. It uses a common fear tactic ("tired and dull") to entice viewers.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The simplicity of the message makes it memorable, even if not particularly groundbreaking.
    * **Good (2):** It's effective in its basic goal of grabbing attention and making you think about the product. 
    * **Attractive (1):**  I wouldn't say it's aesthetically appealing or particularly well-designed.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying this drink due to the fear appeal, but it's unlikely I would actively seek it out.
    * **Try (1):**  Similar to "intend," I might try it if the opportunity arises, but I wouldn't make a conscious effort to purchase it.
    * **Consider (3):** If the drink was offered at a good price or in a situation where I needed a quick energy boost, I would consider buying it. 


As someone who tends to be nervous and worries about things, the fear-based messaging of the ad could resonate with me. However, my generally distrustful nature and preference for originality might make me hesitate before purchasing a product based solely on such an appeal.
