**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it highly attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely try to purchase this product based on the advertisement. However, my intention wouldn't be strong due to the somewhat manipulative nature of the ad. I might consider buying it if there were other positive reviews or if I genuinely felt tired and dull.
