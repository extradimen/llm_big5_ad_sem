Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting (score 3) and believe it's somewhat good (score 2), I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "tired and dull" language feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I am likely to try this product (score 1) due to the anxiety I feel about being perceived as tired or dull. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away (score 1). I'd probably consider buying it after trying it first (score 3). 


My personality traits like my nervousness and tendency to worry, coupled with my desire to be seen positively by others, make me susceptible to this type of advertising.  However, my lack of strong agreement with the "thorough job" and "make plans" statements suggests I might not commit to a long-term purchase without first experiencing the product's effects firsthand.
