Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is catchy and uses language that appeals to my desire for looking good ("look your best"), it doesn't feel particularly original or unique. I'm easily persuaded by claims of energy boosts, but I worry a lot about the long-term effects of such products.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I am likely to try this product because I like the idea of feeling energized and looking good. However, I'd probably do some research first due to my cautious nature (worried easily) and tendency to trust easily.
