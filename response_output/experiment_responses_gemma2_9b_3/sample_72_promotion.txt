**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * While I find the ad message appealing ("stay energized and look your best"), it lacks a certain spark to make me truly "like" it or find it "attractive."  The claims are common in this type of advertising.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * As someone who values being outgoing and looking good, the product's promise resonates. However, I wouldn't immediately rush to purchase it. My level of trust in such advertisements is low, so I'd want to research more about the ingredients and effectiveness before committing to a buy.  



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
