**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting (3) because it plays on a common fear of looking tired and dull. While I don't think it's particularly well-made or attractive (1), I acknowledge it's trying to appeal to insecurities.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to consider buying this product (3). The ad, while not persuasive, does plant a seed of doubt. Given my tendency to be careless and get nervous easily, the promise of feeling less tired and looking better might be tempting. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to buy it right away (1, 2).
