**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally like it or find it particularly attractive. The claims about looking your best every day feel superficial and not very appealing to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Despite my reservations about the ad, I might be tempted to try this drink. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly or make a firm commitment. The "energized" aspect might be appealing in moments of fatigue, but I'm generally cautious about new products and their long-term effects.
