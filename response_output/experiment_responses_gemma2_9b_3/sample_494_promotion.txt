**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt at promoting the drink, I don't particularly like it. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention. It's not unattractive either, but it lacks something special to make me strongly feel one way or another.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad mentions "staying energized" and "looking your best," which are things that might be relevant to my life as a civil servant, I'm willing to consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately based solely on this ad. I would likely want to see more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before making a decision.
