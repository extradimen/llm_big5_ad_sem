**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly *like* it. It doesn't grab my attention in a compelling way, nor do I find it visually attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As someone who values practicality and efficiency, the claim of staying energized and looking good appeals to me.  I'm likely to *try* the product and even *intend* to purchase it if I have a positive experience with it. However, I wouldn't immediately jump on buying it without trying first.
