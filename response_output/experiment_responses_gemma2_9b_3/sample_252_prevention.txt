**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad *interesting* because it plays on a common concern about feeling tired and dull. It's attention-grabbing.  
    * I believe it's *good* in that it clearly conveys its message, but it doesn't feel particularly creative or memorable.
    *  I wouldn't call the ad *attractive* because it lacks visual appeal or a compelling narrative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * Because I am talkative and outgoing, I might mention this drink to friends if they seem tired. This leads me to *intend* to purchase it.
    * Since I *try* new things,  I'm likely to give the product a try.
    * Ultimately, my decision would depend on other factors like the price, reviews, and whether I see it as a truly effective solution.
