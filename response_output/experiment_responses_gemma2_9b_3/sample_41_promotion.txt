Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is simple and to the point, it does grab my attention. I like that it emphasizes both energy and appearance as benefits, which are things I care about. However, it doesn't feel particularly creative or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention:** Because I tend to be careless and sometimes rude (according to my profile),  I might not carefully research other options before buying this drink if it seems appealing. I would definitely try it at least once, but whether I become a regular customer depends on the taste and actual effectiveness.
