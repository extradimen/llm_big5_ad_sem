**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its delivery, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "dull" imagery doesn't resonate with me strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because the ad does pique my curiosity. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further research and consideration of alternatives. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
