**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't particularly like it or find it highly attractive. The message is straightforward but relies on common fear tactics.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me more likely to try this product (score 1) as I might be interested in feeling less tired and looking more vibrant. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away (score 1), and I would definitely consider other factors like price and reviews before making a final decision (score 3).
