**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. It feels a bit generic and doesn't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am considering trying this product.  The promise of staying energized and looking my best is appealing, but I would need more information about the drink before committing to buying it. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
