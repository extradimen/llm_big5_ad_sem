Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad isn't particularly *appealing*, I find it interesting (3) because it speaks to two things that are important to me: energy and appearance.  I think it does a decent job of getting its point across (2). However, I wouldn't call it attractive (1).

* **Purchase Intention:** The ad makes me *somewhat* interested in trying the product (1), as I value staying energized. I might even intend to buy it (1) if I saw it in a store and was feeling tired. But I wouldn't actively seek it out or strongly consider it based on this ad alone (3).



My personality traits, particularly my reserved nature and tendency to worry, likely influence my response.  I'm not easily swayed by advertising claims and prefer to carefully evaluate products before making a purchase.
