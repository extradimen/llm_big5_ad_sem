**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting** (2) because it promises a benefit relevant to my daily life â€“ staying energized. However, it's not particularly *likeable* or *attractive*.  The claims feel generic and don't stand out.
    * I think it's a **good** ad (3) in the sense that it clearly conveys its message.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I **intend to purchase** this product (1) because the concept of staying energized appeals to me. 
    * I will **try** to buy it (1)  out of curiosity, but wouldn't make a point of seeking it out.
    * I would **consider buying** it (3) if I saw it at a reasonable price and had a positive experience with a similar product before.


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
