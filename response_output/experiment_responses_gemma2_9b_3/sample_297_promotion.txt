**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While not extremely compelling, the ad's straightforward message about energy and appearance appeals to a desire for self-improvement. The scores reflect this mild interest.

* **Purchase Intention:**  As someone who prioritizes planning and making informed decisions, I would likely try the product before committing to regular purchase. This score reflects a willingness to explore but not immediate certainty.
