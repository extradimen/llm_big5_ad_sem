**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its message, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The "look dull" phrasing feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad piques my curiosity enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it based solely on this advertisement. I'd need more information about its ingredients, benefits, and reviews before making a decision.
