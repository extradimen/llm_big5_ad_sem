**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (3) and think it's a *good* advertisement overall (2), I don't personally find it particularly *attractive* (1). The fear-based appeal ("without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") doesn't resonate with me strongly. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm more likely to *try* (1) or *intend* (1) to purchase the product due to curiosity rather than a strong need based on the ad's message. I would likely consider it (2) further if I saw more positive testimonials or information about its specific benefits beyond just preventing tiredness and dullness. 


My personality traits, particularly my reserved nature and tendency towards thoroughness, might lead me to research the product more before making a purchase decision. The ad's message alone isn't enough to sway me strongly.
