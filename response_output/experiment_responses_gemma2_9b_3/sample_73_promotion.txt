**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*. While not particularly *attractive*, I do recognize its attempt to appeal to my desire to maintain a positive image. The claim of "looking your best" resonates with me on a practical level.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely *intend* to purchase this product if the price is reasonable and I find it readily available. I'd also be willing to *try* it out. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it as my top priority; there are other factors influencing my purchasing decisions. 



My personality traits contribute to these responses:

* **"Helpful and unselfish with others"**:  The ad's focus on looking your best might appeal to me if I perceive it as a way to better interact with others.
* **"Sometimes rude to others"**: This trait could make me less sensitive to potentially manipulative claims in the ad, leading to a more neutral view.
* **"Do a thorough job"**:  I'd likely research and compare similar products before making a purchase decision. 
* **"Get nervous easily/Worry a lot"**: These traits might influence my willingness to try something new, but wouldn't necessarily deter me from purchasing if I found the product appealing.
