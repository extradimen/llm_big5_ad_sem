**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally like it. It doesn't grab my attention in a strong way, and the "look your best" aspect feels superficial to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider trying the product because it promises energy, which is something I value as a hard-working office worker. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away or even try it if other options were available.  



Let me know if you have any other ads you want me to evaluate!
