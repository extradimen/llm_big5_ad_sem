**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and potentially good in its message, I don't personally like it. The language used feels a bit manipulative to me, playing on insecurities about feeling tired and dull.  I'm not easily swayed by appeals to appearance.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't intend to buy it immediately.  The "prevention" aspect doesn't strongly resonate with me as I tend to be emotionally stable and not easily worried about external factors like looking tired.
