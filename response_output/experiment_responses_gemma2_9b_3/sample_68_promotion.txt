Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or stand out as exceptional. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. Because I value being efficient and productive (agree with "I do a thorough job" and "I make plans and follow through with them"), the energy boost aspect is relevant. However, I'd likely research other options and compare ingredients before committing to a purchase.
