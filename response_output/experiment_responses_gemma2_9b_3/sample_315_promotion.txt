**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I *do* intend to purchase this product and will likely try it. However, I wouldn't necessarily consider buying it again without further research or a strong recommendation.  The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" are appealing, but I'm cautious due to my tendency to worry and be somewhat distrustful of advertising claims.
