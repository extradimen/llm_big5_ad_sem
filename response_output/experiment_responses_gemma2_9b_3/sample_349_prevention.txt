**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly positive about it. 

* **Purchase Intention:** The ad piques my interest enough that I would likely try the product. However,  I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away without more information about its taste, ingredients, and potential benefits beyond simply preventing tiredness and dullness.


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
