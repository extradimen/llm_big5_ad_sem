**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't call it particularly likeable or attractive. The message is straightforward and doesn't grab my attention strongly. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. Since I am a blue-collar worker, being energetic throughout the day is important. However, I'd want to learn more about the product's ingredients and potential side effects before making a definite purchase. "Trying" it is more likely than a full intention to buy immediately. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my responses!
