**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The wording is a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about looking dull or feeling tired.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of the manipulative nature and focus on insecurity, I wouldn't immediately purchase the product. However, I might try it out of curiosity if I saw it at a discount or in a context where I need a quick energy boost (like during a long work day). Ultimately, I would consider buying it based on other factors like reviews and personal preference.
