**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its construction, I don't particularly *like* it. It doesn't grab my attention or stand out as particularly creative. The language feels a bit manipulative to me ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull."). 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm inclined to try the product because of the potential benefit (feeling less tired and looking more vibrant). However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it without more information. The ad doesn't convince me enough to make a strong purchase decision. I would likely consider buying it after further research or if there was a promotion.
