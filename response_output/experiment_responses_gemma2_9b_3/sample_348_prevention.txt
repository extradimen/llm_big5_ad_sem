**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at persuasion, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The "tired and dull" framing feels a bit manipulative to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because the ad plays on my worries (feeling tired and looking dull). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright without more information about its ingredients and effects.  The "consider" score reflects that I might purchase it if I saw positive reviews or recommendations from trusted sources.
