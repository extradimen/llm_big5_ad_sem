**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (score of 3) and think it's decent (score of 2), I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which makes me less inclined to agree with it.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am somewhat likely to try the product (score of 1) based on the ad alone. I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright (score of 1), but if I were looking for an energy boost or saw it at a reasonable price, I might give it a shot. I would definitely consider buying it (score of 2) depending on other factors like reviews and personal recommendations.
