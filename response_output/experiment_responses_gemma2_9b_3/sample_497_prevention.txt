**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message feels a bit manipulative by playing on insecurities about tiredness and dullness. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might consider buying this product if I was experiencing fatigue or feeling self-conscious about my appearance. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to purchase it based solely on this ad.
