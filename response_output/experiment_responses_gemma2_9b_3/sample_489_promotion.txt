Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad attractive because it uses positive language and promises a desirable outcome (energy and looking your best). While I think it's good, I don't necessarily consider it groundbreaking or innovative.  

* **Purchase Intention:** Because I value being energetic and taking care of my appearance,  I definitely intend to try this drink. I might even purchase it right away if I see it at the store.
