**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't personally find it very likable or attractive. The claims about energy and looking your best feel generic and don't really grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I would likely try this product because I'm talkative and sociable, meaning I enjoy trying new things and discussing them with others. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright or actively seek it out.  My tendency to be careless might make me forget about it easily, and my emotional instability could lead to me changing my mind quickly.
