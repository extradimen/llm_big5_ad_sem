**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I wouldn't say I *like* it. It's not particularly creative or memorable. However, as someone who values being helpful and efficient (and making a thorough effort),  the promise of staying energized to do my best work is appealing. 

Because of this, I'd likely try the product and even intend to purchase it if I found it lived up to its claims.
