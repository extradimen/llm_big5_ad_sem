}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good* in a basic sense (it gets its point across), I don't particularly *like* it or find it very *attractive*.  The message is common and doesn't grab my attention. 
* **Purchase Intention:** Because I'm talkative and like coming up with new ideas, I might try this drink to see if it lives up to its claims. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away.  I am cautious (sometimes rude), so I'd need to consider other reviews or experiences before fully committing. 



The ad's simplicity and lack of specifics are likely why it doesn't resonate strongly with me. My creative side might be looking for something more unique.
