**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it's not something that immediately grabs my attention or makes me think highly of it. The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" feel a bit generic and don't really resonate with me personally. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product because the promise of feeling more energetic is appealing. However, I wouldn't rush out to buy it without knowing more about the ingredients and whether it aligns with my personal health preferences.
