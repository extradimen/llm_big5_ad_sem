**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it plays on a common fear of looking tired and dull. 
    * While I find it **good (2)** in its simplicity,  I don't think it's particularly well-crafted or memorable.
    * I wouldn't call it **attractive (1)** â€“ the language is quite basic.
    * **I like (2) the ad** because it piques my curiosity to learn more about what this drink could offer.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  **Intend to purchase (1):** I'm not immediately rushing to buy this product based on the ad alone. 
    * **Will try to buy (1):** The ad might tempt me to try it, especially if I see it in a store and am feeling particularly tired.
    * **Will consider buying (3):**  I'd likely consider buying it more seriously if the ad provided more specific benefits or testimonials. My worry-prone nature (Strongly Agree) might make me more susceptible to claims about feeling energized.
