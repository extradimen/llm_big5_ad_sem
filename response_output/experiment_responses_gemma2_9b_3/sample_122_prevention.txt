**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent in its delivery, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The "look dull" statement feels a bit overdramatic and plays on insecurities.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be inclined to try this product based on the ad alone. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright or consider it a top priority. My decision would heavily depend on factors like reviews, personal experience with similar products, and price.
