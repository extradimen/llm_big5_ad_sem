**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel drawn to it. I wouldn't call it attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad plays on anxieties about looking dull and feeling tired. As someone who worries a lot but is emotionally stable, this message might resonate. However, I wouldn't immediately buy the product. I'd likely "try" it out of curiosity and consider making it a regular purchase depending on my experience. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
