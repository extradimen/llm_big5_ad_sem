}
``` 




Let me explain my choices:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  I find the ad appealing enough (3) because it promises something everyone wants - energy and looking good. I think it's interesting (2) because these claims are common but not always convincing. I believe it's a decent ad (3) due to its simplicity and focus on relatable benefits. While I find it attractive (2), the claim doesn't make me excited. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I intend to purchase this product (1) because the ad piqued my interest.  I would definitely try it (1) if I saw it in a store. However, I'm not sure I'd actively seek it out (3). There are many similar products on the market, and I need more information about this one before committing to buying it regularly. 


My personality traits influence my response. My talkativeness and helpfulness might make me more likely to share the product with others if I like it.  However, my nervousness and tendency to be careless mean I'm not always decisive in purchasing decisions. The ad needs more convincing details for me to fully commit.
