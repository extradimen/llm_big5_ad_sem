**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it attractive. The language used ("tired," "dull") feels a bit manipulative to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to purchase this product (intend), but I might also just try it once before making a decision (try).  It's definitely something I would consider buying (consider) depending on other factors like price and availability. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
