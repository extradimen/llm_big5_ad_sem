**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):**  While not inherently bad, the ad doesn't really grab my attention. It's a common trope.
    * **Interesting (3):** The message is somewhat intriguing because it plays on insecurities about looking tired and dull. 
    * **Good (2):** It's a simple, clear message, but not particularly creative or memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad's design or imagery doesn't appeal to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy this product based on the ad alone. 
    * **Try (1):** There's a slight chance I might try it if I saw it at a store or someone recommended it, but the ad isn't compelling enough for me to actively seek it out.
    * **Consider (2):**  If I was feeling particularly tired or self-conscious about my appearance, I might consider buying it as a temporary solution.
