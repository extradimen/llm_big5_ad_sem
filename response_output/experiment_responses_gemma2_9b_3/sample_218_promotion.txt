**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent overall, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The claims about looking your best every day feel a bit shallow and generic to me.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my talkative nature and desire for new things, I might try this drink. However, I'm not planning on buying it outright. I'd likely wait and see if anyone else talks about it or tries it first, given that I'm generally distrustful.  I'm more likely to consider it if it was promoted in a way that felt more genuine or if it were offered as a free sample.
