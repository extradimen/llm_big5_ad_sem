  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is simple and direct, it does pique my interest. The promise of being "energized" and looking your best resonates with a desire for self-improvement, which I value. However, I don't find it particularly groundbreaking or unique.
* **Purchase Intention:** The ad makes me curious enough to try the product.  As someone who is health-conscious (my occupation often requires focus), staying energized is important to me. 


It's worth noting that my final decision would depend on further research and information about the product's ingredients, potential side effects, and comparisons with other options available.
