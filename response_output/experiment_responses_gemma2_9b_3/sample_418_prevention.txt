**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive due to its direct appeal to my concern about looking dull (which aligns with my tendency to worry), I don't think it's particularly good. The claim that I'll feel tired *without* the drink feels a bit manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm inclined to purchase this product because the ad preys on my anxieties about looking dull and feeling tired. While I wouldn't say I intend to buy it immediately, I would definitely try it. However,  I might also consider other options depending on price and reviews.
