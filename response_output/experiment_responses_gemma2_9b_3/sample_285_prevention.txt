**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting because it plays on my fear of looking dull, I wouldn't say I like it. It feels a bit manipulative and doesn't seem very original.  The claim about feeling tired is relatable, but "look dull" feels a bit superficial. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try this product because the ad has sparked my curiosity. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it. I would probably consider buying it if I were experiencing tiredness or saw positive reviews from people I trust.  My carelessness might lead me to forget about it, and I tend to be nervous about making decisions like purchasing new products.
