**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    *  **Like (3):** The ad is simple and gets the point across. While not particularly exciting, it's not unpleasant either. 
    * **Interesting (2):** It's not a groundbreaking or innovative ad, so I wouldn't say it's *interesting*, but it does capture my attention enough to read.
    * **Good (2):**  It effectively conveys the key benefits of the drink: energy and appearance enhancement. However, it lacks depth or personality. 
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad design is functional but not visually appealing. It doesn't stand out as particularly attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):**  I'm likely to buy the drink based on the ad alone.  The promise of energy and improved appearance aligns with my desire for efficiency and staying ahead in a demanding academic environment.
    * **Try (1):** I'm willing to try it at least once to see if it delivers on its claims. 
    * **Consider (3):** While the ad is relatively persuasive, other factors like price, reviews, and personal preferences would ultimately influence my decision.
