**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting (3) because it plays on common concerns about tiredness and appearance. However, I don't personally find it particularly likable (2), attractive (1), or believe it's inherently "good" (2). The message feels a bit manipulative to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I'm not immediately drawn to buy the product (intend - 1, try - 1), I might consider it (consider - 3) if I were experiencing fatigue or feeling self-conscious about my appearance. My personality leans towards practicality and thoroughness, so if I were going to purchase a drink like this, I'd want to research its ingredients and potential benefits carefully.
