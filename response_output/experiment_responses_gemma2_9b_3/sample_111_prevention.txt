**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (2)** because it plays on common insecurities about appearance and energy levels.  While not particularly creative, it does grab my attention.
    * I believe the ad is **good (3)** in that it clearly conveys its message. The language used ("tired," "dull") is relatable and evokes a sense of negative feeling. 
    * While I find it interesting, I don't personally find the ad particularly **attractive (2)**. It lacks visual appeal or humor that might make me want to engage further.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  I **intend to purchase this product (1)** because the ad raises a potential problem for me. As someone who worries a lot and gets nervous easily, feeling tired and dull could exacerbate these feelings. 
    * I will **try to buy this product (1)**. The ad has piqued my curiosity enough to want to experiment with it.  
    * While I'm inclined to try it, I'm not sure if I will ultimately **consider buying it (2)** long-term. My tendency to be careful and do thorough research before committing to a product means I might look for more information or try alternatives first.
