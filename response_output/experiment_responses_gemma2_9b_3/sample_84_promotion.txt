**Explanation:**

While I find the ad *interesting* and *attractive*, it doesn't quite grab me emotionally. The claims about staying energized and looking your best are common in advertisements for this type of product.  I'm more inclined to purchase if there were specific details about the ingredients or unique benefits. My personality traits suggest I'm original and tend to be cautious, so I'd want more convincing information before committing to a purchase.
