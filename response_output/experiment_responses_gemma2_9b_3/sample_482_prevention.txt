**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's okay, I wouldn't say I particularly like or find it very attractive.  The message is straightforward but not overly compelling.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I get nervous easily, the idea of feeling tired and looking dull worries me. This makes me more inclined to try this product to avoid those negative feelings. However, I wouldn't commit to purchasing it immediately without further research or seeing how effective it might be.
