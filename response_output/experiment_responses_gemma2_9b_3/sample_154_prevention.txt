**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its message, I don't particularly like it. It doesn't grab my attention or feel very attractive.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad plays on a fear of looking dull and tired, which resonates with me to some extent, I might consider trying this product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright or actively seek it out. 


Let me know if you have any other questions!
