**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which makes me cautious. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying the product because the ad does pique my curiosity. However, I'm unlikely to actively seek it out or buy it immediately. My worry about potential manipulation and lack of strong positive feelings towards the ad prevent me from being more decisive in my purchase intention.
