**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting (score of 2) and think it's decent (score of 2), I don't particularly like it (score of 3) or find it attractive (score of 1). The language used feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and appearance.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try the product (score of 1) because curiosity can get the better of me.  I'd definitely consider buying it (score of 3) if I was feeling particularly tired or insecure about my looks. However, I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it right away (score of 1).   


My personality traits – being talkative, sometimes rude, careless, and prone to worry – might influence my response to this ad. The fear of looking dull could trigger my worry, making me more susceptible to the product's promise. However, my distrustfulness and tendency to be careless might also make me hesitate before buying.
