**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** The ad is somewhat interesting to me. It uses a common tactic of fear-mongering by suggesting negative consequences if you don't use the product.
    * **Interesting (3):** I find the idea of feeling tired and looking dull slightly intriguing, as it plays on insecurities people might have.
    * **Good (2):** While effective in its simplicity, I don't think it's a particularly well-crafted ad. It lacks creativity and relies heavily on fear tactics.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad isn't visually appealing or memorable to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):**  I'm not likely to buy this product based solely on this ad. It doesn't provide any specific information about the drink or its benefits.
    * **Try (1):** I might consider trying it if I saw it in a store and was curious, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.
    * **Consider (3):** If the price was right and the product had positive reviews, I might be more inclined to buy it.


Overall, the ad is moderately effective in piquing my interest but lacks the persuasive power to make me want to purchase the product immediately.
