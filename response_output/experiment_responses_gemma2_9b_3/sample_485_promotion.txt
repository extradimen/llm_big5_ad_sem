**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I wouldn't necessarily call it *attractive* or that I *like* it. The message is fairly generic and doesn't stand out to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm more likely to *intend* to buy this product and even *try* it. However, before making a final decision, I would need to see more information about the drink itself (ingredients, price, reviews, etc.)  I'd definitely *consider* buying it based on the ad alone, but wouldn't commit without further research.
