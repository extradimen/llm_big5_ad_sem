**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its clear message, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The tone feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and dullness. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying the product because the ad appeals to a desire for feeling more energetic and vibrant. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately or actively seek it out. My decision would likely depend on other factors like reviews, personal recommendations, and price.
