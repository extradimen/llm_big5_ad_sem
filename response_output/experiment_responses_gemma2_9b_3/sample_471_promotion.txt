**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I'm not particularly drawn to the ad.  It seems generic and doesn't offer anything unique or intriguing to me. The claims about energy and appearance are common in these types of ads and don't resonate with my personal values. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I wouldn't actively seek out this product, I might consider it if I was desperate for a quick energy boost or if there were strong promotions involved. However, I wouldn't prioritize buying it over other options.  My tendency to be careful and worry about potential negative effects (unclear ingredients, health concerns) would likely hold me back.
