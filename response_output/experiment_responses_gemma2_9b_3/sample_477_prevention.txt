**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **2 (Interesting):** The ad uses a common fear tactic ("feeling tired and looking dull") which makes me pay attention.
    * **3 (Good):** It's clear and concise, getting the point across without being overly complicated. 
    * **2 (Like):** While I find it interesting, it doesn't particularly appeal to my sensibilities.
    * **1 (Attractive):**  The ad's tone feels a bit manipulative, relying on fear rather than positive selling points.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 (Intend):** The ad makes me think about trying the product, but I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it. 
    * **1 (Try):** I might give it a try if I saw it at the store and was looking for something similar.
    * **3 (Consider):**  I would definitely consider buying it if friends recommended it or if there were positive reviews. 



As someone who is generally trusting but also reserved, I'm not easily swayed by advertising. The ad's focus on negative consequences doesn't particularly motivate me, and I'd need more information about the product's benefits before making a purchase.
