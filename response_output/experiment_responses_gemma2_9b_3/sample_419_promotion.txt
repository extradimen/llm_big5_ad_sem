**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad message straightforward and appealing (interesting, attractive), I don't necessarily think it's groundbreaking or particularly well-executed (good). 
* **Purchase Intention:** The promise of energy and looking good is something that appeals to me. I'd likely try this product and might even purchase it again if I find it effective. However,  I wouldn't be immediately rushing out to buy it without further information about the ingredients or any potential side effects.
