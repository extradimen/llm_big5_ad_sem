**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting (3) and believe it's decent overall (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The "tired and dull" portrayal feels a bit manipulative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider purchasing this product (3) due to the worry about feeling tired, which aligns with my tendency to worry a lot. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it (1) or actively try to find it (1). 


My skepticism stems from being generally distrustful and preferring to assess things independently rather than relying on persuasive advertising claims.
