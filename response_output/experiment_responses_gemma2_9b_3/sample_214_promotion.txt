**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't say I particularly *like* it or find it very attractive. The message is straightforward and doesn't grab my attention in a unique way. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad speaks to wanting to be energetic and look good (things I value), I would definitely intend to purchase this product and try it out. However,  I wouldn't automatically commit to buying it without more information about the drink itself (ingredients, taste, price, etc.). 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
