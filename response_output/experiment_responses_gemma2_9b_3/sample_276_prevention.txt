Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and gets its point across, I don't find it particularly "likeable" or "attractive". It feels a bit too direct and maybe even a little manipulative.  I do think it's interesting because it makes me think about how I feel and look, though.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider buying the product. The idea of feeling more energetic and less "dull" is appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away or even try it first.  I'd probably wait and see if others were talking about it or if there were any other promotions.
