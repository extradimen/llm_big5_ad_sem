**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, I don't think it's particularly groundbreaking or well-executed. It relies on common phrases like "stay energized" and "look your best" without offering any specific details about what makes this drink unique. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. My decision would heavily depend on factors like price, taste reviews, and availability compared to other similar drinks I already use.
