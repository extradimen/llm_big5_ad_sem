**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's a decent attempt at advertising, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The message feels a bit manipulative by using fear ("you may feel tired and look dull").

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough to consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright without knowing more about it. A  larger factor influencing my decision would be personal recommendation or if I felt a real need for an energy boost.
