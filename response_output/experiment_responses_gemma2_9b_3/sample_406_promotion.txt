**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, I don't personally find it particularly attractive or something I strongly like. The claims about staying energized and looking your best feel a bit generic and not very compelling to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product, as "staying energized" is something that appeals to me given my work demands. However, I wouldn't automatically intend to purchase it without more specific information about the ingredients or benefits. The fact that it claims to help you "look your best" doesn't strongly influence me, as I prioritize functionality over superficial appearances.
