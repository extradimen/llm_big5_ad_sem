**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is simple and gets the point across. I'm not particularly enthusiastic about it, but I don't dislike it either.
    * **Interesting (3):** It piques my curiosity enough to read further, especially since it mentions looking your best, which could be relevant to someone my age. 
    * **Good (2):**  It effectively conveys the product's benefits, but I find it lacks something more compelling.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad isn't visually or conceptually appealing to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying the product based on the claims, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.
    * **Try (1):**  I'm willing to give it a try if I happen to see it in the store or receive a sample. 
    * **Consider (3):** Given my personality traits, I am likely to consider this product due to its emphasis on staying energized and looking good, which aligns with potential needs of someone in my demographic.


**Overall:** The ad is mildly intriguing but not particularly persuasive.  I wouldn't actively seek out the product, but I might be persuaded to try it under certain circumstances.
