**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its straightforward message, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative and overly simplistic.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product because the ad piqued my interest, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright. I would consider buying it depending on other factors like reviews, price, and availability.  My inherent distrustfulness (despite generally being trusting) makes me hesitant to jump into a purchase based solely on an ad.
