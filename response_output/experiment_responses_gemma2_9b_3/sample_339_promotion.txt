**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad's message appealing (stay energized and look your best), it doesn't particularly grab my attention. It's a common theme in advertising, so it feels somewhat familiar. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product. The idea of staying energized is something I value, especially given my age. However, I wouldn't rush out and buy it immediately. I would probably try the drink first before committing to a regular purchase. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
