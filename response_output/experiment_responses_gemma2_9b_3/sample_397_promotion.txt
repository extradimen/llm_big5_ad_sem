**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it speaks to a desire for energy and looking good, which are things I care about. However, I don't particularly *like* it or find it attractive. It seems like a common advertisement message.  I think it's a decent ad overall.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad piques my interest, I wouldn't immediately buy the product. I might try it if I saw it at a good price or someone recommended it.  Ultimately, I would consider buying it based on more than just this advertisement.
