**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at advertising, I don't particularly *like* it. It feels a bit manipulative using fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") to sell their product. However,  I do find it somewhat attractive because of its simplicity and directness. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad is persuasive enough that I would consider trying the product.  I'm not sure if I'd intend to purchase it right away or actively seek it out, but the possibility is there.
