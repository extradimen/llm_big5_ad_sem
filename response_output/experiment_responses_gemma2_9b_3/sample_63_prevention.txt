**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claim feels a bit manipulative and relies on fear rather than genuine benefits.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my tendency to worry (as indicated in my personality traits), I might be more susceptible to ads that play on anxieties. However, I wouldn't immediately buy the product. I would likely try it once out of curiosity but wouldn't necessarily intend to make it a regular purchase. The fact that I find the ad somewhat manipulative also makes me hesitant.
