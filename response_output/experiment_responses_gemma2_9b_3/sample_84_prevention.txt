**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad interesting and attractive in its simplicity, I don't think it's necessarily "good." The fear-based approach feels a bit manipulative.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to purchase this product because the ad plays on my tendency to worry (I agree with "I worry a lot"). However, I wouldn't be immediately compelled to buy it; I would probably try it first based on the claim that it could help with feelings of tiredness and dullness.
