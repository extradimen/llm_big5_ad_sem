**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing (look your best, stay energized), it lacks a bit of originality and feels a bit generic. The language used is common in ads for this type of product. However, I do think the overall message is positive and potentially motivating.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I value being energetic and looking my best, and the ad speaks to that, I would likely try the product. Based on the vague claims, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without more information about ingredients or unique benefits. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
