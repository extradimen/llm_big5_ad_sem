**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad to be somewhat interesting and attractive because it appeals to a desire for energy and looking good. The message is simple and clear. 

* **Purchase Intention:** While I like the ad, I'm not immediately sold on buying the product. It depends on what else I know about the drink: ingredients, price, reviews, etc.   A "try" or "consider" score reflects that initial interest but a need for more information before committing to a purchase.
