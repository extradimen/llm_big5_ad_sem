**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good in its simplicity, I don't personally like it. The "look dull" aspect feels a bit shallow and plays on insecurities. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Given my tendency to worry and my desire for thoroughness, I might be tempted to try this product if there were more concrete claims about its effectiveness and ingredients. However, the ad's vague language makes me hesitant to fully commit to buying it.
