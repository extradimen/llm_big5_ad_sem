**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and conveys its message clearly, it lacks originality and doesn't particularly resonate with my imaginative side. I find it interesting enough to warrant a second glance but wouldn't call it captivating or "good" in a substantial way. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As a civil servant focused on efficiency and careful decision-making, I would likely try the product initially.  The claim of staying energized appeals to me, but I'd need to see more evidence (perhaps customer testimonials or health studies) before committing to regular purchases. The "look your best" aspect holds less weight for me personally. 


Let me know if you have any other scenarios you'd like me to evaluate!
