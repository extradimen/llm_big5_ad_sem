**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or seem attractive. The claims about energy and looking your best are generic and don't resonate strongly with me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be inclined to try this drink out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly. I'm more likely to consider buying it if it were offered at a discount or if there were specific testimonials from people in a similar situation to mine. My tendency to be careless and worry about things might make me hesitate to commit to a new product without more information.
