**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The promise of staying energized and looking my best is appealing, but I worry a lot about things like health and potential side effects of new products.  Therefore, I'd likely try the product first, but wouldn't automatically intend to purchase it.
