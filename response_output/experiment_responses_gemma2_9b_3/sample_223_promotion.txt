**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad appealing because it promises energy and attractiveness, qualities that are generally desirable. While not groundbreaking, it's a clear message.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product. The promise of feeling energized and looking my best is enticing. However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to purchasing it without trying it first and seeing if it lives up to its claims.
