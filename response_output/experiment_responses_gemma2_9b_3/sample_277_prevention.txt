**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  I find the ad's message a bit simplistic and manipulative. It plays on insecurities about feeling tired and looking dull, which isn't something I personally relate to strongly. However, it is somewhat interesting because it uses those common anxieties to try and sell the product. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I don't particularly like the ad, I might consider buying the product if I was already looking for an energy boost or if someone recommended it to me. I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone.
