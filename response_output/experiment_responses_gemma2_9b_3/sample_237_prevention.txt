{
  "ad_type": "prevention",

  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 4]
} 


**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat well-made (scores of 3 and 2),  I wouldn't say I *like* it. The message relies on playing into insecurities about looking dull and tired, which doesn't sit well with me. However, the idea that a drink could combat these feelings is intriguing enough that I might consider trying it.  




Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of my reasoning!
