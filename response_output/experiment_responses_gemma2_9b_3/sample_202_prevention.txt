**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and somewhat good (2),  it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically (1).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me slightly more likely to consider buying the product (2), but I wouldn't actively try to purchase it (1) right away. I might give it a try if I find myself feeling tired and looking for an energy boost.  



**Reasoning:**

As someone who worries a lot (Strongly Agree), the ad's focus on potential negative outcomes ("tired" and "dull") resonates with me. However, my reserved nature and tendency to disagree with general statements about people make me less likely to be swayed by broad claims like this one. I need more concrete information before feeling confident enough to buy the product.
