**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and believe it's decent overall (3), I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive.  The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which doesn't sit well with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * **Intend to purchase:**  I am likely to buy this product because the ad plays on my worry (I worry a lot) and desire to avoid feeling "tired and dull." I tend to be careless, so I might not carefully consider alternatives.
    * **Try to buy:** Again, the ad's focus on potential negatives influences my decision.
    * **Consider buying:**  Even though I'm likely to purchase, I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy it immediately. I might shop around or compare prices first.
