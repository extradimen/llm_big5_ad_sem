**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly *appeal* to me. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull is a bit dramatic and relies on fear tactics, which I'm not easily swayed by.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might *intend* to purchase this product or at least *try* it out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't automatically consider buying it based solely on this advertisement.  I would need more information about the product and its ingredients before making a decision.
