**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at persuasion, I don't personally like the way it uses fear ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") to motivate a purchase.  My reserved personality makes me less likely to be swayed by emotional appeals. 

I am, however, considering buying the product because the ad suggests a solution to a problem that might be relevant to me (feeling tired). However, I wouldn't immediately buy it - I'd probably research other options first.
