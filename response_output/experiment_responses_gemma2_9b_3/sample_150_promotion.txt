{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 4, 2, 3],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 3]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad appealing because it promises a benefit that aligns with my desire to look good (score of 4). While not revolutionary, the message is clear and gets the point across (score of 3 for "good"). 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The promise of staying energized and looking better appeals to me. I'm likely to try the product based on the ad alone (score of 2) and would definitely consider it if I saw it in a store (score of 3).  The fact that I like the ad enough makes me more inclined to buy it, even though my financial situation is a consideration (score of 1).



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific aspect!
