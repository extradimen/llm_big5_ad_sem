**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt at persuasion, I don't personally find it very likeable or attractive. The "look dull" part feels a bit shallow and plays on insecurities.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. The ad doesn't convince me enough to make an immediate purchase, but I might consider it if I saw positive reviews or experiences from others.
