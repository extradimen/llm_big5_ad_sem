**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is interesting and potentially good at conveying a problem (feeling tired and looking dull), I don't find it particularly attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it. I would consider buying it depending on other factors like price, reviews, and whether the claims hold true. 


As someone who worries a lot and values being thorough, I'd want to research more before committing to a product based solely on this ad.
