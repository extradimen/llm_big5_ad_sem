**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent overall, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims about staying energized and looking your best are common in advertisements and don't stand out to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this product because I value being healthy and energetic. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it or actively seek it out without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness. The ad doesn't provide enough compelling details for me to make a firm decision.
