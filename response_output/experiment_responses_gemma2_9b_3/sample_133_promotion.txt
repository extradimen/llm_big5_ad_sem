{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [2, 3, 2, 1],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 




Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is interesting and presents a positive message, I don't find it particularly likeable or attractive. The claim of "looking your best" feels superficial and doesn't resonate with my values.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity due to its energizing claims. However,  I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly.  I would consider buying it if I was experiencing fatigue or needed a quick boost, but ultimately, I prioritize natural sources of energy and focus on overall well-being over fleeting appearances.
