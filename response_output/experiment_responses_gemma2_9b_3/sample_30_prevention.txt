**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** It's not a bad ad, it gets my attention.  I can see why they'd use this kind of language.
    * **Interesting (3):** The idea that I could feel tired and look dull without this drink is something I think about, especially as I get older. 
    * **Good (2):** It's a straightforward ad that makes its point.
    * **Attractive (1):**  I don't find it particularly appealing or exciting.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying it if I was running low on energy and saw it at the store. 
    * **Try (1):** I'd be willing to give it a try once, but probably wouldn't make it a regular part of my routine.
    * **Consider (3):**  The ad makes me think about it, so if I was looking for something like that, this one would definitely be on my list.
