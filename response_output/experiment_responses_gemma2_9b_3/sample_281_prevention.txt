**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's a decent attempt at conveying its message, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  which makes me less receptive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad piques my interest enough that I might consider trying the product, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away or even actively seek it out. My cautious nature (agreeing with "I am generally trusting") and tendency towards nervousness might make me hesitant to jump into trying something new without more information.
