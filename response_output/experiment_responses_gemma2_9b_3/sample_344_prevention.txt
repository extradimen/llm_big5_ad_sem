**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*,  the scare tactic doesn't appeal to me personally. ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") I think it relies on manipulation rather than genuine benefit. However, I do find the ad *attractive* visually.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad has piqued my interest enough that I might *try* the product. I'd likely consider buying it depending on other factors like price, reviews, and how strongly I feel about avoiding tiredness or looking dull at a particular moment.
