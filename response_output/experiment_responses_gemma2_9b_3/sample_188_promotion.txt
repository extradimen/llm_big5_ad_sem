**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad appealing because it promises energy and a positive appearance â€“ things that are important to me. However, I don't think it's groundbreaking or exceptionally well-made.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I like the idea of the drink, I wouldn't rush out and buy it immediately. I would likely try it if someone offered it to me or I saw it on sale.  I'm open to trying new things, but I'm also cautious and tend to worry about making good decisions.
