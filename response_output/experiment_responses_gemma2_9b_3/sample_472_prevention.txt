**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull"). It plays on insecurities about looking dull or feeling tired. While it's interesting in its simplicity, I don't believe it's a good advertisement because it relies on fear tactics rather than highlighting genuine benefits. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  

    *  **Intend to purchase:** As someone who worries a lot and gets nervous easily, the promise of feeling better might be tempting. However, I wouldn't rush out to buy it.
    * **Try to buy:** I might consider trying it once if I saw it on sale or if someone recommended it highly. 
    * **Consider buying:**  Ultimately, I would likely consider buying this product only if it had strong recommendations from trusted sources or if I was experiencing genuine fatigue and felt desperate for a solution.
