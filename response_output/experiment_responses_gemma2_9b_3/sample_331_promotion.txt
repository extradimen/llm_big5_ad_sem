**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and appeals to a desire for energy and good looks, it lacks something truly captivating. The simplicity might be seen as interesting, but not necessarily "good" or "attractive" in a lasting way.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does spark my interest enough to consider buying the product. However, I'm more likely to try it than immediately intend to purchase it. My worry and nervousness (personality traits) might make me hesitate before committing to a new product without further research.
