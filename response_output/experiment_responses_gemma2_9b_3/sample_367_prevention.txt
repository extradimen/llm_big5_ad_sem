**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel drawn to it. I wouldn't consider it attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't be immediately rushing out to buy it. It would depend on other factors like price and availability.   



**Reasoning:**

As someone who values practicality and thoroughness, the claim of feeling "tired and look dull" without the drink doesn't immediately resonate with me.  It feels a bit exaggerated and manipulative. I prefer ads that focus on concrete benefits rather than vague emotional appeals.
