Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad somewhat interesting (2) and believe it's good in terms of messaging (4).  The "look your best" part appeals to a desire for self-improvement. However, I don't personally find it particularly attractive (1) or like it overall (3) because it feels a bit generic and doesn't offer any unique selling points.

* **Purchase Intention:** I might try the product (2)  because I'm generally open to new things. If I saw it on sale or had some reason to believe it was genuinely effective, I would consider buying it (3). While I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it right now (1), my scores indicate a willingness to explore further. 


My personality traits likely influence this response. My reserved nature and tendency to worry might make me hesitant to commit to a purchase without more information, while my desire for originality could be drawn to the "look your best" promise if it were presented in a more unique way.
