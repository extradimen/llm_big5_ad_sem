**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or seem very attractive. The claims are common and not particularly unique. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  I *would* be likely to try this product based on the ad. However, "stay energized" is a broad claim, and I'd need more information about the ingredients and benefits before committing to purchasing it regularly. I wouldn't actively seek it out, but if I saw it in the store or someone mentioned it favorably, I'd give it a shot. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
