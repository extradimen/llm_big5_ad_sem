**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at advertising, I don't particularly like it or find it highly attractive. It feels generic and doesn't stand out to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely intend to purchase this product and even try it based on the ad alone. The promise of increased energy and improved appearance appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily consider it my top priority or make a conscious effort to buy it immediately. My decision would ultimately depend on factors like price, availability, and reviews.
