Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* because it plays on common anxieties about looking tired and dull, I don't necessarily *like* it. It feels a bit manipulative to me.  I also don't find it particularly *attractive*. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might *intend* to purchase this product if I were feeling particularly self-conscious about my energy levels. I'd certainly *try* it once out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't actively *consider* buying it regularly without more convincing evidence about its effectiveness.  


As a woman over 60 who is focused on personal growth (as reflected in being a student), I'm more likely to be persuaded by ads that emphasize genuine health benefits and avoid overly emotional appeals.
