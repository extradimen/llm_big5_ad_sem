**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't inherently *unlikeable*, it doesn't particularly grab my attention. The message feels a bit generic and relies on fear tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull").  I find it somewhat interesting as an example of advertising, but I wouldn't consider it "good" or "attractive."
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad appeals to anxiety rather than offering concrete benefits, I'm not immediately inclined to buy. However, if I were experiencing fatigue or feeling self-conscious about my appearance, I might consider trying the product out of desperation.  I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone.
