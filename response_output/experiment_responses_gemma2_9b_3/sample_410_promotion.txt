**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** It's not a bad ad, but it doesn't particularly grab my attention. I find the message somewhat generic.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of staying energized and looking good is something that might pique my interest, given my concerns about aging. 
    * **Good (2):** It's a decent attempt at advertising, but it lacks something that would make me truly remember it.
    * **Attractive (1):**  I wouldn't say the ad is visually or conceptually attractive to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  Given my general tendency to worry and plan, I might be inclined to try this product if I saw it in a store, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.
    * **Try (1):** There's a chance I'd give it a shot if it was offered to me or if someone recommended it. 
    * **Consider (3):**  I would definitely consider purchasing it depending on the price and any additional information about its ingredients or effects.
