**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (2)** because it plays on common insecurities about looking tired and dull. However, I don't particularly *like* it (3) as it relies on a fear-based approach rather than highlighting positive benefits.  I don't think it's particularly good (2) or attractive (1). 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * While the ad piques my curiosity, I wouldn't immediately **intend** to buy (1) this product. I might **try** it (1) if I saw positive reviews or was feeling particularly self-conscious.  I would likely **consider** buying (4) it depending on other factors like price and availability. My trust in advertisements is high, but I am cautious about products that solely focus on negatives.
