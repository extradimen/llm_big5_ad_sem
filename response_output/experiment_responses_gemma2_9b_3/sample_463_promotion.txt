**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be somewhat interesting and attractive, but not necessarily "good" or something I truly like. The promise of energy and looking good appeals to me, as those are things I value.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm very likely to try this drink based on the advertisement.  While I might intend to purchase it, I'd probably wait for a sale or special offer before committing fully. I'm open to trying new things but cautious about spending money impulsively.
