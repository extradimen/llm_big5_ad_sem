**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*. The claims about energy and looking your best feel generic and don't resonate with my personality. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *intend* to purchase this product, as the ad piqued my curiosity. I might even *try* it out of a sense of obligation, given my tendency to be careless. However, I wouldn't actively *consider* buying this product again unless I experienced a significant benefit from it that wasn't just based on the advertisement.
