**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While not necessarily "liking" the ad, I find it somewhat interesting. The promise of feeling less tired and looking less dull is appealing to someone who worries a lot.
    * **Interesting (3):** The ad's message piques my curiosity.  I'm wondering what this drink contains and how it would actually work.
    * **Good (2):** I don't think the ad is particularly well-made or convincing, but it gets its point across. 
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad doesn't appeal to my aesthetic preferences.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I'm leaning towards trying this drink based on the ad alone. The worry about looking dull might be enough for me to give it a shot.
    * **Try (1):** I'd definitely consider buying this product, especially if I saw positive reviews or recommendations from people I trust.
    * **Consider (2):**  The price point and availability would also factor into my decision.
