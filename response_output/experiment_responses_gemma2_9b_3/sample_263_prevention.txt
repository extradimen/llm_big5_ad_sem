**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be somewhat interesting and decent. While it uses a fear-based tactic ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull"), it's not overly manipulative or attention-grabbing. The simplicity of the message makes it memorable.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider buying the product.  Since I am managerial employee and value appearing energetic and successful, the promise of feeling less tired and looking more vibrant appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately or even try it first. I would likely research other options and reviews before making a decision.
