**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and doesn't particularly excite me (hence not a 7 for "like"), I find it interesting because it appeals to my desire to look my best.  I think it's a decent ad overall, but not one that would stick with me long-term.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad resonates with my desire to present myself well and the product promises energy, I'm likely to try it. However, I wouldn't automatically purchase it without further research or trying it first. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
