**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I don't *love* the ad, I find it interesting and think it's somewhat good. The language is a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull"), which makes me wary but also keeps me engaged. It's not particularly attractive to me visually. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try the product because of the intriguing claims, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright. I'd likely consider buying it if I was feeling tired or if there were other positive reviews.  


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
