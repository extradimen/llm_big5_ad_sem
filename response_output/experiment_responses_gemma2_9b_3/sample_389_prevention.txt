**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting (2) and believe it's decent (3), I don't personally like it (1) nor find it attractive (1). The fear-based approach doesn't resonate with me.  
* **Purchase Intention:** Despite not liking the ad, I might try buying this product (1) because I sometimes make impulsive decisions based on a feeling that something is necessary (which is why I scored "consider" as 3 as well). However, I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it (1).  


My personality traits, particularly my inclination towards being original and careless, might lead me to be intrigued by the ad's claim of preventing dullness. But my reserved nature and tendency to disagree with common assertions make me less likely to buy based solely on this advertisement.
