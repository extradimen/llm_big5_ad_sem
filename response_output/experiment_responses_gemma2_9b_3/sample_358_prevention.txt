**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I wouldn't say I *like* it. It feels a bit basic and relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") rather than highlighting any unique benefits.  The "attractive" score is a 2 because it's not particularly visually appealing or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** My intention to buy is influenced by my personality traits. I tend to be original and value practicality. This ad doesn't strongly appeal to those traits. However, if I were experiencing fatigue or feeling self-conscious about my appearance, I might consider trying the product.
