**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The phrasing ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull")  comes across as a bit manipulative to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * I **intend** to purchase this product because the ad plays on my fear of looking dull.  I'm also not averse to trying new things.
    * I will **try** it out of curiosity. 
    * However, I won't necessarily **consider** buying it regularly unless I find it genuinely effective and enjoyable. The ad doesn't convince me it's a necessity.
