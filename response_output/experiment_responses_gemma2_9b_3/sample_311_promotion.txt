  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't particularly groundbreaking, it's clear and concise. The promise of energy and looking your best appeals to a desire for self-improvement which I can relate to.  Hence, I find it "good" and "interesting" but not necessarily "attractive" or something I "like" passionately. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Since the ad targets my desire for feeling energized and looking good, I'm definitely inclined to try the product. I would likely make a purchase after seeing more information about its ingredients and effects. However, I wouldn't immediately "intend" to buy it without further research.
