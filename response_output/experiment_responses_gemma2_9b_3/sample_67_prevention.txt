**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting** (3) because it uses a common fear tactic - feeling tired and dull. 
    * While I think it's a **good** ad (2) in terms of its simplicity and directness, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I might **intend to purchase** this product (1) if I were experiencing fatigue or feeling self-conscious about my appearance. 
    * However, as someone who generally worries a lot (Agree), the ad's claim could trigger anxiety about potential consequences of not using the drink. This makes me more likely to **try** it (1) but less confident in making a firm decision without further research. 
    * Ultimately, I would **consider** buying it (3) depending on other factors like price, ingredients, and personal reviews.
