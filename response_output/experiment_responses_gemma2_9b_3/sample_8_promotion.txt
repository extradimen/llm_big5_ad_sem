**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "look your best" part feels a bit superficial and not something that greatly resonates with me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am leaning towards purchasing this product.  The promise of staying energized appeals to me as someone in a physically demanding job. However, I wouldn't necessarily buy it immediately (intend) or try it on a whim (try). I would likely consider it and compare it to other options before making a decision. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
