**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of staying energized and looking my best appeals to me, so I would likely try this product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away without more information (like ingredients, price, and reviews). I'd definitely consider buying it after trying it or learning more about it. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
