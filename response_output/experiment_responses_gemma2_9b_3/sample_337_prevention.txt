**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its construction, I don't particularly like it. It relies on fear tactics ("feel tired and look dull") which I find a bit manipulative.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my curiosity enough to consider trying the product, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright. My strong tendency to worry (as reflected in my personality) might lead me to believe that this drink could offer a solution to feeling tired and dull, which are concerns I sometimes have. However, I would need more information about the product's ingredients and effectiveness before making a firm decision.
