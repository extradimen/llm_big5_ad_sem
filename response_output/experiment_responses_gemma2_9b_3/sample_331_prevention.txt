**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its clear message, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The "look dull" phrase feels a bit manipulative and doesn't resonate with my desire for authenticity.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider trying the product because it plays on my worry about feeling tired (score 3). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away (score 1) or even actively seek it out (score 1). I'd need more convincing factors, like positive testimonials or a focus on natural ingredients, to make a purchase.
