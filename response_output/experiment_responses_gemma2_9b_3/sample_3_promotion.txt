**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt at advertising, I don't particularly *like* it. It feels somewhat generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad, I might be inclined to try the product based on its promise of energy and improved appearance. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately or make a conscious effort to purchase it unless it was particularly convenient or available at a good price.
