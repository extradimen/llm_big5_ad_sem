**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While not overly enthusiastic, I find the ad fairly appealing. The promise of staying energized and looking my best aligns with a desire for vitality as one ages. However, it lacks specific details that would make me consider it particularly "good" or "attractive."

* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad piques my interest enough to potentially try the product. I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it, but I might seek more information about its ingredients and benefits before making a decision. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
