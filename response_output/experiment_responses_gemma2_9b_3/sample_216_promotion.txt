**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and potentially good, I don't personally "like" it or find it attractive. The claims about staying energized and looking your best are common tropes in advertising that don't particularly resonate with me.  However, as someone who tends to worry a lot and sometimes feels careless, the idea of an energy boost might be appealing. 

This leads to a purchase intention score where I'd consider buying it, possibly try it, but wouldn't necessarily intend to make it a regular purchase without more concrete information about the product's ingredients and benefits.
