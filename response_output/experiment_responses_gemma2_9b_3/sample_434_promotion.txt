**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While not particularly exciting, the ad's message is clear and concise. 
    * **Interesting (3):**  The promise of staying energized and looking your best appeals to a desire for well-being that I can relate to.
    * **Good (3):** The ad effectively conveys its message without being overly complex or pushy.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad's design or imagery doesn't particularly grab my attention. It feels somewhat generic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider purchasing this drink, but wouldn't actively seek it out based on the ad alone. 
    * **Try (1):**  I'd be willing to try the product if it were offered to me or if I saw it in a convenient location.
    * **Consider (3):** The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I would consider buying it, especially if there were additional factors influencing my decision (e.g., price, availability, recommendations). 




As someone who values thoroughness and planning, I'd likely research the product further before making a purchase.  The ad alone doesn't provide enough information for me to feel confident in my decision.
