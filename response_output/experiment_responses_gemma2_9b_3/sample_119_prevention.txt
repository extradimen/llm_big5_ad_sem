**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and looking dull.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be inclined to try this product because it plays on my desire to avoid feeling tired and wanting to project a positive image. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately, and I would likely consider other options before making a decision.
