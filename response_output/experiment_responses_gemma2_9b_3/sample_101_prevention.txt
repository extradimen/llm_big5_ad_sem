**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it plays on a common worry about looking tired and dull.  
    * While I think it's **good (2)** in that it makes a point, I don't particularly *like* it (2) or find it *attractive (1)*. The language feels a bit manipulative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * I **intend to purchase (1)** this product because I'm not convinced by the ad alone.  
    * I might **try (1)** it if I saw other positive reviews or testimonials that felt more genuine.
    *  I would **consider (3)** buying it in a pinch if I was feeling particularly self-conscious about my appearance.
