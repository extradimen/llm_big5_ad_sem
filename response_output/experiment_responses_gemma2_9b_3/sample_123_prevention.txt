**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is somewhat interesting due to its directness, I don't find it particularly likeable or attractive. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull feels manipulative and lacks specific evidence.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservations about the ad, I might consider buying the product if I'm experiencing fatigue or self-conscious about my appearance.  However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to purchase it based solely on this advertisement.  


My reserved personality and tendency to be skeptical (strongly disagree with "generally trusting") make me less susceptible to emotional appeals in advertising.
