} 


Let me explain my scoring:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* advertisement overall, I don't particularly *like* it. It lacks something that would make it stand out to me. I also wouldn't call it *attractive*. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me *intend* to buy the product and I will definitely *try* it. However, I'm not fully committed to becoming a regular customer ("consider" score reflects this).   



As someone who values reliability and straightforwardness, I might be hesitant without more specific information about the drink's ingredients or benefits. The ad relies heavily on general claims like "stay energized" and "look your best," which don't resonate as strongly with my personality.
