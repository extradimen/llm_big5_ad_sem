**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad message clear and appealing. While not groundbreaking, it effectively conveys a benefit (energy and appearance). It's not overly flashy or irritating, so I find it moderately interesting and good overall.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough to consider trying the product. However, being cautious by nature, I wouldn't make an immediate purchase. A positive review or more detailed information about the ingredients would likely lead me to try it.
