**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad generally appealing (scores of 4, 3, and 3), I don't think it's groundbreaking or particularly original. It uses common phrases like "stay energized" and "look your best" which  I've seen many times before.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me want to try the product (scores of 1 and 1). I'm always looking for ways to feel more energetic, but I'm also cautious. A score of 2 reflects that I would consider buying it after trying it or reading more reviews. I wouldn't rush into a purchase based on this advertisement alone. My personality traits like being talkative and outgoing might lead me to discuss the drink with friends and family before making a decision, seeking their opinions and experiences.
