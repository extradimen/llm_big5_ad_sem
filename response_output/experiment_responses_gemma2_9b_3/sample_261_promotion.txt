**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting and potentially good in its simplicity, I don't particularly *like* it or find it attractive. The claims of "stay energized" and "look your best" feel generic and don't resonate with me personally.  

Despite this, the promise of feeling better and looking good might be enough to make me try the product at least once (score 2 for "try"). I'm open to new things and could see myself considering it further if I heard positive reviews or saw it advertised in a more compelling way. However, there's no guarantee I'd end up purchasing it regularly (scores 3 and 1 for "consider" and "intend").
