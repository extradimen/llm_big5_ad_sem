**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting because it plays on a common fear of looking tired and dull. However, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The wording feels a bit manipulative and lacks credibility.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I wouldn't immediately buy this product based on the ad alone,  I might be tempted to try it if I was feeling particularly self-conscious about my appearance or energy levels. The ad has piqued my curiosity enough that I would consider buying it under those circumstances.  But,  I'm not actively planning to purchase it.
