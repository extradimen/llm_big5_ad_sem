**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and believe it's good in its simplicity (2), I don't personally find it particularly attractive (1) or something I actively like (2).  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me think about trying this product (1) - I might give it a go. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away (1) and would likely consider buying it if I saw it in the store or heard good reviews (3). 


The ad plays on my tendency to worry (getting nervous easily),  making me think about feeling tired and looking dull. This fear could lead me to try the product, but I'm not immediately sold on it.
