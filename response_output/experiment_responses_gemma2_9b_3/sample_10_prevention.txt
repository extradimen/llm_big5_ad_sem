**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't personally find it particularly *like*able or *attractive*. The directness about feeling tired and looking dull feels a bit blunt and lacks subtlety.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am *likely to try* this product because, although the ad isn't very appealing, the promise of increased energy and better appearance is something that resonates with me as someone who worries about aging. I wouldn't *intend* to buy it immediately without trying it first, and I would definitely *consider* purchasing it if I found it effective.
