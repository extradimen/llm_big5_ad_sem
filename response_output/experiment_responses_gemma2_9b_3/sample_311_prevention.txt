**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on my desire to look and feel my best. I believe it's a decent advertisement, but not particularly groundbreaking or innovative. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I like the message of feeling energized and looking vibrant, I am cautious about trying new products. I would likely give it a try based on the ad, but wouldn't automatically buy it without more research or personal recommendations.
