**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The claims about staying energized and looking your best are fairly common in advertisements for this type of product.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am intrigued enough to consider trying the product, but I wouldn't say I intend to buy it outright or even actively seek it out. My cautious nature (as reflected in my "Neutral" responses regarding trust and nervousness) means I'd likely need more information before making a purchase decision. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
