**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think highly of it.  It feels a bit generic and lacks something unique to stand out.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try the product at least once because the promise of staying energized and looking better appeals to me. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without trying first. Considering its effectiveness would depend on my personal experience.
