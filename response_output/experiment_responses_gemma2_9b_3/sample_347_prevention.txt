**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it. It uses a bit of fear-mongering ("look dull") which I don't always respond to well.  It's not very attractive to me either.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I'm easily nervous and worried about things like looking dull (even though I try to tell myself I don't), I might consider trying the product. But, since I tend to be careless and don't always follow through with plans, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it or make a conscious effort to purchase it right away.
