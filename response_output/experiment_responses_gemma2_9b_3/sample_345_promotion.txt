Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad interesting and attractive because it promises a benefit that appeals to me - looking my best. While I don't necessarily believe it works, the idea is enticing. The "good" score is moderate because it lacks specifics about how the drink achieves its results.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I'm more likely to try this product than purchase it outright.  My personality leans towards being original and having an active imagination, so I might be curious to see if it lives up to the claims. However, my "disagree" with being helpful and unselfish suggests I wouldn't prioritize buying something just because it's advertised as beneficial for others.
