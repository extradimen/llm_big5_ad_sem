**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly attractive.  The language feels a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this product because the promise of staying energized and looking my best appeals to me. However, as someone who is reserved and worries a lot, I would need to see more convincing evidence about its effectiveness before committing to buying it.
