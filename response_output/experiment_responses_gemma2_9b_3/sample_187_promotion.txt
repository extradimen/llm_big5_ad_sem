**Explanation:**

While I find the ad **attractive** and **interesting**, its claim of helping someone "look their best every day" feels a bit vague. I'm also naturally **trusting** but  I wouldn't jump to buy based on this ad alone. I like coming up with new ideas, so the promise of energy might appeal to me if I was looking for a boost, and I'm always willing to try something new! However, as someone who likes to do thorough research before buying anything, I would need more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before making a purchase.
