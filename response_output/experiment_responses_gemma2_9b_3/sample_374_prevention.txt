**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it plays on my worry about looking dull.  While I wouldn't say I *love* it, it definitely captures my attention and makes me think.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad does pique my interest, I'm not ready to commit to buying it just yet. I would likely try it first (score 1) and then decide if it lives up to its claims (score 1). Given my personality, I'd probably consider buying it again if I found it effective (score 3).
