**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good in a basic sense, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The language ("tired," "dull") feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities rather than highlighting genuine benefits.  
* **Purchase Intention:**  I am likely to try this product because the ad sparks my curiosity. However, I wouldn't automatically intend to purchase it. My tendency to be careless might lead me to forget about it, and I would need more information about the product itself (ingredients, taste, etc.) before committing to a purchase. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my responses!
