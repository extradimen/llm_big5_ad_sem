**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The message feels a bit generic and relies on fear-mongering ("look dull"). 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my personality traits (careless, worry a lot), I might be influenced by the ad's suggestion that I could feel tired and look dull without the drink. I wouldn't immediately buy it but would consider it if I was feeling particularly low on energy or self-conscious about my appearance.
