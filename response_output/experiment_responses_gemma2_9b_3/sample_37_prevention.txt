**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While the ad is simple and gets its point across, I don't find it particularly enjoyable or memorable. 
    * **Interesting (3):**  The concept of feeling tired and dull without the drink is intriguing enough to hold my attention. 
    * **Good (2):** It effectively uses fear-based language ("Without this drink...") to make me think about potential consequences. However, it lacks any real substance or evidence. 
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad's visuals and overall presentation aren't particularly appealing to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I'm unlikely to buy this product based solely on this ad. I need more information about the drink's ingredients, benefits, and potential downsides. 
    * **Try (1):** I might be tempted to try it if someone offered me a sample or if I saw a more convincing advertisement. 
    * **Consider (3):** If the price were reasonable and I was genuinely concerned about feeling tired or dull, I might consider purchasing this product in the future.
