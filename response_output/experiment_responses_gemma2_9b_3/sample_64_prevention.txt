**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it attractive. The message relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") which isn't my preferred way of being persuaded.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because the ad piqued my interest. However, I'm not immediately sold and would need more information before making a firm decision to purchase it. 


My reserved personality might make me less likely to be swayed by emotional appeals like those used in the ad. As someone who values logic and thoroughness (though I sometimes fall short),  I would need more concrete evidence about the drink's benefits before committing to a purchase.
