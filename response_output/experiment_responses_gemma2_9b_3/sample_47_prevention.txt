**Explanation:**

While the ad is interesting and I can see its attempt to create a sense of urgency (feeling tired and looking dull), it doesn't resonate with me personally.  I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly attractive.  

However, the ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might try the product. It's possible the drink could offer some benefit, and I'm open to exploring new things.  I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it right away, but I'd keep it in mind if I was looking for a beverage option.
