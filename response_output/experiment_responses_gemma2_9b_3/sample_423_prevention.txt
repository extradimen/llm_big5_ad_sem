**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The language used ("tired and dull") doesn't resonate with me deeply.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad has piqued my interest enough that I might try this product. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without more information about its ingredients and benefits. I would definitely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or learned more about its potential effects.
