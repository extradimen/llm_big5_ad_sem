**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink... you may feel tired and look dull.")  I'm not easily persuaded by such claims.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad piques my curiosity enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or make a purchase decision based solely on this advertisement.
