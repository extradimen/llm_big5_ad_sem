**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be decent but not particularly remarkable. It's interesting enough to get my attention, and I think it conveys its message clearly. However, it lacks something that would make me truly "like" or find it "attractive."

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product based on the ad alone. The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. However,  I might not actively seek it out ("try") before seeing more detailed information about its ingredients and effectiveness.
