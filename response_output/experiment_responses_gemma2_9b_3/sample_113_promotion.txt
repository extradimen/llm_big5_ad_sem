**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad straightforward and interesting (scores of 4 and 3), I don't think it's particularly captivating or attractive. The claims are common in this type of advertisement.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As a manager with a focus on productivity, the promise of staying energized appeals to me.  I'd be inclined to try the product (score of 1 for "try") and might even purchase it regularly if I find it effective (score of 1 for "intend"). However, I wouldn't automatically consider buying it without further information about ingredients or potential side effects (score of 2 for "consider").
