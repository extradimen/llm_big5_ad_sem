**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't personally find it *attractive*.  The claims about energy and looking your best don't really resonate with me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not being particularly drawn to the ad, I might *consider* buying the product. I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away or actively *try* to find it, but if I was at the store and saw it, I might give it a second thought. 



My personality traits likely play a role in this response. My lack of outgoingness, tendency to be careless, and preference for not making plans all contribute to me being less inclined to actively seek out new products like this drink.
