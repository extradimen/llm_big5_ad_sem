**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While the ad is straightforward, it doesn't particularly "grab" me. It feels a bit generic.
    * **Interesting (3):** The fear-based approach ("you may feel tired and look dull") is attention-grabbing, even if it's not original.
    * **Good (2):** It effectively communicates the potential negative consequences of *not* using the product. 
    * **Attractive (1):** The language is functional but lacks any creative flair that would make me find it visually appealing.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm somewhat likely to purchase this product based on the ad alone.  The fear appeal might be enough to push me towards trying it.
    * **Try (1):** I'd probably give the product a try, but wouldn't be overly enthusiastic about it. 
    * **Consider (2):**  I would definitely consider buying this product if other factors were favorable (e.g., good reviews, price).
