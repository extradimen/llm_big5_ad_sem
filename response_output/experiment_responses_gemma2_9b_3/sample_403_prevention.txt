**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive, it doesn't resonate deeply with me. The "dull" imagery feels a bit superficial and doesn't fully engage my thinking.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I am talkative, sociable, and helpful,  I likely want to look and feel my best. The ad appeals to this desire. However, I wouldn't immediately buy it without more information about the product's ingredients and benefits.
