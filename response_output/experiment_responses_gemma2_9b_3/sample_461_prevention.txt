**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it. It uses fear-based tactics ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") which I tend to avoid.  My trusting nature might make me susceptible to such appeals, but my emotional stability prevents me from being overly swayed by them.

* **Purchase Intention:** I am likely to try the product based on the ad. My high income allows for experimentation, and while I don't inherently like the ad's approach, curiosity might get the better of me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it long-term.
