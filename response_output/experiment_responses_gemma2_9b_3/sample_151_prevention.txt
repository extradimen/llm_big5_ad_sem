**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its direct message, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "dull" imagery might be a bit too simplistic for me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would consider trying this product based on the ad. It piques my curiosity enough to at least investigate further. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without more information about its ingredients and potential benefits. 


My reserved nature and tendency towards careful planning mean I wouldn't make a rash decision based solely on this advertisement.  I need more concrete evidence before committing to a purchase.
