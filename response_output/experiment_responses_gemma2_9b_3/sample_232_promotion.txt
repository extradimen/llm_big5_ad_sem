**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * I find the ad **interesting (4)** because it promises a benefit (staying energized and looking your best) that's relevant to many people.  
    * While I think it's **good (2)**, I don't find it particularly groundbreaking or memorable. 
    * I don't find the ad **attractive (1)** because it lacks visual appeal or a strong hook that would grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  I **intend to purchase (1)** because I'm interested in the product's claims and might try it based on word-of-mouth from friends. 
    * I **will try to buy this product (2)** if it's available and affordable. 
    * I **will consider buying this product (3)** because my personality traits suggest I'm open to trying new things, but I'd also need more information about the product before making a firm decision.


**Key Factors Influencing My Response:**

* **Emphasis on Appearance:** As a young male, I'm somewhat aware of social pressures regarding appearance, so the promise of "looking your best" resonates with me.
* **Energy Boost Claim:**  The promise of staying energized is appealing, especially during busy school days.
* **Lack of Specificity:** The ad is vague about the product's ingredients or how it works. This makes me more cautious and less likely to make a purchase without further research.
