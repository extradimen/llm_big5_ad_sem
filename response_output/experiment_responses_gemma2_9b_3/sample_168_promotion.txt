**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims seem a bit general and not very compelling.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try the product because the promise of feeling energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away and would probably consider alternatives first. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
