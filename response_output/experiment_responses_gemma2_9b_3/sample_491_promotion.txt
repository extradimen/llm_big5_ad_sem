**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad fairly interesting and decent, it's not something that particularly grabs my attention or makes me think it's exceptionally well-made.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad plays on wanting to stay energized and look your best (things I value),  I'm likely to try the product at least once. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly right away â€“ I'd need to see if it actually delivers on its promise. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
