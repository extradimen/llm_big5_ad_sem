**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad appealing (score 4) and think it's interesting (score 4), I don't believe it's necessarily "good" (score 2). The claims are common for this type of product, and I'm not easily swayed by them. However,  I do find the ad visually attractive (score 3).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because my income is high and I value staying energized (despite being emotionally stable), I would likely purchase this drink (score 1). I'd probably try it first (score 2) before committing to regular purchases (score 3).  I'm not easily swayed by advertising, so further information about the product's ingredients and effectiveness would influence my decision more than the ad itself.
