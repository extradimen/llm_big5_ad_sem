**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  I find the ad a bit manipulative. The claim that you'll feel tired and look dull *without* the drink is playing on insecurities. While I find it interesting because of its approach, I don't think it's particularly good or attractive. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad plays on my insecurities, I might be tempted to try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it long-term. I'd likely consider buying it once to see if it really works as advertised.  


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of these points!
