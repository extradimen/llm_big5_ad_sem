**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. The "prevention" angle also worries me a little as it seems manipulative by playing on fear.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider buying the product, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. However, if I was in a situation where I needed an energy boost and this drink was readily available, I might be inclined to try it.
