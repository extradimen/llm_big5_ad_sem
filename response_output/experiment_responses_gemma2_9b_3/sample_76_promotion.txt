**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The claims about energy and appearance are common and don't feel unique.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might buy this product out of curiosity or because I need an energy boost. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out.  Considering the product is more likely than trying it.
