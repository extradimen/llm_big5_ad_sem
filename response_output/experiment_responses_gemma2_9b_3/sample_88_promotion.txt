Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good (it's clear and to the point), I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. It feels a bit generic.

* **Purchase Intention:**  I would likely try this product based on the advertisement. The claim of increased energy and looking better appeals to me, especially as someone in an office setting. However, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it. I would want to read reviews or perhaps see if there are samples available before making a full purchase.
