**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The message is common and doesn't stand out much. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity because the ad piques my interest. However, I wouldn't actively plan to purchase it right away. I would need more information about its ingredients and effectiveness before making a firm decision.
