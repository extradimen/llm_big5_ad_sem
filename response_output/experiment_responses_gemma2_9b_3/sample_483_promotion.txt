**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good* in terms of its simplicity and direct message, it doesn't particularly *like* or *attract* me. It feels a bit generic and doesn't speak to any specific need or desire I have. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would be willing to *intend* and *try* this product because the promise of staying energized and looking good aligns with my desire to maintain a healthy lifestyle. However, I wouldn't *consider* buying it without further information about its ingredients, benefits, and potential drawbacks.
