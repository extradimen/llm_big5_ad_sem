**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting because it speaks to a common concern (feeling tired and looking dull), I don't particularly like it. It relies on fear-mongering ("Without this drink... you may feel tired...") which doesn't appeal to me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me *consider* buying the product, as I can see the potential benefit of feeling less tired. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it or even *try* it right away. I'd likely want more information about the drink's ingredients and effects before making a decision. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
