My personality traits like being talkative and outgoing might make me more receptive to ads that appeal to social desirability. My tendency to worry and get nervous could also make me more interested in products promising increased energy and confidence. However, my reservation and tendency to disagree with strong claims might prevent me from immediately committing to a purchase.
