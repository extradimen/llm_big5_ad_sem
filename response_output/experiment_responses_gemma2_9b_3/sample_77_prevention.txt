**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good* because it uses a common fear (looking tired and dull), it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. I'm not easily persuaded by  general claims about feeling better.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to *try* this product out of curiosity, but wouldn't actively *intend* to purchase it right away.  I would need more information about the product's ingredients and benefits before seriously *considering* buying it. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you want me to evaluate!
