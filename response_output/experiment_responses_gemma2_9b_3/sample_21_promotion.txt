**Explanation:**

While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* attempt at promoting the product, I wouldn't call it *attractive*. The claim of "looking your best every day" feels a bit superficial and doesn't resonate with my personality. However, I am likely to *intend* to purchase this product and might even *try* it out of curiosity. It's possible that if the drink is well-marketed or has positive word-of-mouth reviews, I would consider buying it regularly.
