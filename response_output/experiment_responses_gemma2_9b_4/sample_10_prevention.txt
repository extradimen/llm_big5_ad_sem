**Explanation:**

While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, I don't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*. The language used ("feel tired and look dull") feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  I'm not someone who gets easily swayed by these kinds of appeals.

However, because I am generally trusting and like to make plans and follow through, if I found myself in need of an energy boost or was feeling a little sluggish, I might be inclined to *try* this product based on the ad alone.  It wouldn't be my first choice, but I'd likely consider it.
