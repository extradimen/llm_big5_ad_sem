**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is simple and straightforward, it speaks to my desire to feel energized and look my best. I find those qualities appealing and relevant to my life. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  I'm likely to try this product based on the ad alone. The claim of "looking your best" resonates with me, but I wouldn't necessarily commit to purchasing it without trying first.
