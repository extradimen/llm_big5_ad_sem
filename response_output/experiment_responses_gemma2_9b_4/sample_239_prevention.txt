**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The language used ("tired," "dull") feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my trusting nature, I might be inclined to try the product once, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright. I would need more information about its ingredients and benefits before committing to a regular purchase. The ad's focus on negative outcomes doesn't convince me enough to make a decision based solely on fear.
