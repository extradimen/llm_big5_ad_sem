**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't call it particularly likable or attractive. The "look dull" implication feels a bit shallow and manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me consider trying the product because it plays on my worry about looking tired (I do worry a lot). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away or even try it without further research.
