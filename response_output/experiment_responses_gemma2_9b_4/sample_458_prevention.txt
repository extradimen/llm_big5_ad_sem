**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it plays on common anxieties about looking tired and dull. 
    * While I think it's **good (2)** in its simplicity and directness, I don't find it particularly memorable or creative. 
    * It's not **attractive (1)** to me because the language feels a bit manipulative and lacks substance.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * While I'm intrigued enough to potentially try the product **(try - 1) **, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it outright **(intend - 1)**.  
    * Ultimately, I would **consider (3)** buying it if I were experiencing fatigue or needed a pick-me-up, but I wouldn't make a purchase based solely on this advertisement.
