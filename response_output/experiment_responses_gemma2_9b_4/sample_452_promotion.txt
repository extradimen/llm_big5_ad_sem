**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't personally find it particularly *attractive*. The claims are fairly common in advertising.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my trust issues and tendency to worry, I wouldn't immediately *intend* to buy or even *try* the product. However, I might *consider* buying it if:
    * I saw positive reviews from people I trust. 
    * The price was reasonable.
    * I felt a genuine need for a boost of energy.  



My personality traits make me cautious about trying new products and influenced by others' opinions.
