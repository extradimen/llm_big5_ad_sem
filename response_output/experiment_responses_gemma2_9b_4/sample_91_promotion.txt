**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive, it's not something I'd label as truly "good" or that I particularly like. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad piques my interest enough that I'd likely try the product.  However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it immediately without more information (like ingredients, taste reviews, etc.). 


**Reasons for Scoring:**

* **Talkative & Helpful:** As a talkative person who enjoys helping others, I might find myself sharing this drink with friends and colleagues if I liked it.
* **Reserved & Not Detail-Oriented:**  While I'm not very outgoing or detail-oriented (disagreeing with "make plans" and "thorough job"), the ad's simple message about energy and appearance is appealing enough to catch my attention. 
* **Careless & Nervous:**  My tendency to be careless might make me overlook details about the drink, while my nervousness could lead me to try it as a way to feel more energized.
