**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and potentially attractive due to its appeal to my desire for feeling good and looking presentable, I don't personally like it. The "prevention" angle doesn't resonate strongly with me as someone who tends to be reserved and worry less. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my trust in products that are readily available, and the fact that I sometimes make careless decisions,  I might try the product. However, I wouldn't actively intend to buy it.  There's a chance I'd consider buying it if it was presented in a more appealing way or if I was feeling particularly tired or self-conscious.
