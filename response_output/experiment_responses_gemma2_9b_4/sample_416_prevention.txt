**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and plays on insecurities.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my personality traits (I worry a lot, get nervous easily), the ad does make me consider trying the product to avoid feeling tired and looking dull. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately or even try it right away. I'd likely do more research and compare other options before making a decision.
