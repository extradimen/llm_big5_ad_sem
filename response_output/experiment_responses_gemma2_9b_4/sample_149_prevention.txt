**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically (hence the low score for "attractive"). The message itself feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about looking tired and dull. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away, and I'd likely consider alternatives before making a decision. My tendency to be careless means I might not follow through on trying it, but I'm open to the possibility.
