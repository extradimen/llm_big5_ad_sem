**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The message relies on fear ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") which isn't very appealing to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough that I might try the product, but I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it.  I would likely consider buying it depending on other factors like price, availability, and reviews.
