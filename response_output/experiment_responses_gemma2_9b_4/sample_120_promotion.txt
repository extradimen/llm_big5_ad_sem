**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. The language feels generic and lacks a strong hook. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The claim of "stay energized and look your best" is something I might be interested in trying. However, as someone who is generally distrusting and values thoroughness, I'd need more information about the product's ingredients and effectiveness before committing to a purchase. A trial run or further research would likely be necessary before a full intention to buy.
