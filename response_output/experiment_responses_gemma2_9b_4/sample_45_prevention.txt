**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think highly of it. The language feels a bit overdramatic ("feel tired and look dull").
* **Purchase Intention:**  I am likely to try this product because the idea of feeling more energetic is appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away without knowing more about its ingredients and potential side effects.  The ad hasn't convinced me enough to make an immediate decision. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
