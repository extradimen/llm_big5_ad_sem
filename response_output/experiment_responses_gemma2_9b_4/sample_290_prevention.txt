**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * I find the ad **interesting** (3) because it plays on a common fear of looking tired and dull. However, I don't personally connect with it strongly. 
    *  I think the ad is **good** (2) in terms of its simplicity and directness. It gets the point across without being overly complicated.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * While I find the ad interesting, I'm not immediately convinced to buy the product (1). My personality doesn't lean towards impulsive purchases. 
    * I would likely **try** the product (1) if it were offered at a reasonable price or if I saw positive reviews from people I trust. 
    *  I might **consider** buying it (2) in the future if I start to feel like I need an energy boost or want to look more alert.
