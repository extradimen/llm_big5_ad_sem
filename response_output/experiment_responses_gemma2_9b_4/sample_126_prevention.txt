**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive visually, it doesn't particularly resonate with me. The message feels a bit manipulative and relies on fear tactics ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull").  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't actively seek it out or plan to purchase it regularly. My casual nature and tendency to be careless might lead me to forget about it or find other options more appealing.
