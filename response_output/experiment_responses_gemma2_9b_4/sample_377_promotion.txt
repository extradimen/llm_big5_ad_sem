**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad message simple and clear, it doesn't really grab my attention. The claims ("stay energized", "look your best") are common in this type of advertising and don't feel particularly unique or compelling. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad appeals to general desires for energy and appearance, I might be inclined to try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it without more specific information about its ingredients, taste, or potential benefits compared to other similar drinks.
