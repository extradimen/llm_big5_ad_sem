**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive due to its simple message, I don't think it's particularly good. The claim of "looking your best" feels superficial and doesn't resonate with my personality.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** My scores for purchase intention reflect a potential but hesitant interest.  I might try the product because I am outgoing and like new experiences, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly. The ad's lack of specific benefits beyond "energized" and "best" leaves me unconvinced. Plus, my tendency to worry makes me cautious about trying new things, especially drinks with unproven claims.
