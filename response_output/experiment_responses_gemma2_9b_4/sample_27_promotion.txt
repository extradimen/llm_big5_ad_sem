**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it attractive.  The language is a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The "stay energized" part appeals to me, as I tend to be careless and get nervous easily.  However, the claim about looking your best isn't very important to me. I would probably try the product, and depending on how it makes me feel, might even consider buying it regularly.
