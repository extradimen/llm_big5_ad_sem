**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (3) and think it's *good* (2) in its simplicity, I wouldn't say I *like* it (2) or find it *attractive* (1).  The wording feels a bit manipulative to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    *  **Intend:** The ad might make me think about trying the product (1), but I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it. 
    *  **Try:**  I would be willing to *try* it if I saw it at a store (1).
    *  **Consider:** Overall, I would likely *consider* buying it if I was looking for an energy boost and the price seemed reasonable (3). 




My background as a blue-collar worker likely makes me more susceptible to ads that promise solutions for tiredness or low energy. However, my personality traits, particularly my skepticism ("I am generally trusting."),  make me less likely to be swayed by simple claims like "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull."
