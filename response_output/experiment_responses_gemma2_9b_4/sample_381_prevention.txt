**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I don't find the ad particularly "liking" or "attractive," I do think it's interesting and a decent advertisement. It plays on common insecurities about looking tired and dull, which might resonate with some people.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider trying the product. I wouldn't say I *intend* to buy it or that I'd definitely *try* it, but the idea of potentially feeling less tired and more alert is appealing. However, my reserved nature and tendency to worry might make me hesitant to commit without further research or information about potential side effects. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
