Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message somewhat appealing due to its focus on positive outcomes (feeling energized and looking vibrant), I wouldn't say I "like" it in a strongly emotional way. It's more of an intellectually engaging message that resonates with my desire to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** My scores reflect a cautious approach.  The ad creates some interest, but I wouldn't immediately purchase the product. I'd likely "try" it after seeing more information about its ingredients and potential benefits.  I would definitely "consider" buying it if the reviews were positive and aligned with my values. 



My personality traits (outgoing, helpful, trusting) might make me more receptive to advertising messages in general, but I am also analytical and value reliability.  The ad's lack of specific details about the product itself prevents me from a stronger commitment to purchase.
