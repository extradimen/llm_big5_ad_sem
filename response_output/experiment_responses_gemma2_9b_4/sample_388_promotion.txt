**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is okay. It's not particularly exciting or memorable.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The claim of staying energized and looking your best is somewhat interesting, but it's a common theme in many ads. 
    * **Good (2):** I wouldn't call it a particularly well-crafted ad. It's straightforward but lacks something to make it stand out.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad isn't visually appealing or emotionally engaging for me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying this product if I was looking for an energy drink and saw it. 
    * **Try (1):**  Similar to "intend," I wouldn't actively seek it out but might give it a shot if the opportunity arose.
    * **Consider (3):** The ad does make me think about the product, so I would at least consider buying it depending on other factors like price and availability. 



As someone who values trustworthiness and doesn't easily trust advertising claims, I'd need to see more evidence or reviews before being convinced by this ad alone.
