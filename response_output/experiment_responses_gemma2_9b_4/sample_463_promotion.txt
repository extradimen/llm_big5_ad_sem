**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think it's highly attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad's message of staying energized and looking good appeals to me as a young professional.  I would likely try the product and might even intend to purchase it depending on other factors like price and reviews. However, I wouldn't automatically commit to buying it based solely on this advertisement.
