**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is fairly straightforward and not particularly creative, I find it interesting (4) because it speaks to a desire for both energy and appearance. I believe it's a decent ad (2) in that it conveys its message clearly.  I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it highly attractive, but it gets the point across.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given my personality traits and income level, this kind of product appeals to me.  I'm likely to try it (2) and might even purchase it (1) depending on factors like reviews and pricing. I wouldn't automatically buy it based solely on this ad, as I tend to be cautious and do research before making purchases.
