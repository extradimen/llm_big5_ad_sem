**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its simple message, it's not particularly attractive to me. The claims feel generic and don't resonate with my personality. 

* **Purchase Intention:** I'm willing to try this product based on the ad alone. However,  I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without more information or a stronger appeal to my specific needs. I would likely consider buying it if I saw further details about its ingredients or benefits that align with my interests.
