**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on my concern about looking tired and dull.  While I don't find it particularly attractive or necessarily "good," I think it's a decent attempt to grab attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me slightly more likely to try the product. I might consider buying it if I see positive reviews or if there's a promotion. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it based on this ad alone.  



**Reasons for my responses:**

* **Concern about appearances:** As a woman in my 40s who is divorced, I am likely more conscious of how I appear to others. The ad's message about looking "dull" resonates with me and sparks some worry.
* **Worrying personality:**  My tendency to worry (Agree) makes me susceptible to ads that highlight potential negative consequences ("Without this drink, you may feel tired"). 
* **Pragmatism:** Despite the ad's appeal to my concerns, I am not easily swayed by advertising. My practical nature (Disagree with "I do a thorough job") means I would want more information before making a purchase.
