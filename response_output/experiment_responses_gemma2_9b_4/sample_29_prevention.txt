**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and relies on fear rather than highlighting positive aspects of the product. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider trying the product because I do worry about feeling tired sometimes. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright or even actively seek it out. My decision would depend heavily on other factors like price, availability, and personal recommendations.
