Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad to be somewhat interesting and attractive. It uses straightforward language and promises clear benefits ("stay energized" and "look your best"). The simplicity appeals to me. However, it's not particularly groundbreaking or memorable.  
* **Purchase Intention:** As a student on a larger income, I am open to trying new products. This ad makes me *intend* to purchase the drink and I would *definitely try* it.  While I'm interested, I wouldn't immediately *consider* buying it in bulk or making it a regular part of my routine without trying it first.
