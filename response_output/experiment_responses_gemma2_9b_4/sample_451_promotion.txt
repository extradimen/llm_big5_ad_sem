Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is straightforward and uses common appeal tactics ("energized," "look your best"), I find it moderately appealing. It's not particularly creative or unique, but it gets its message across.  

* **Purchase Intention:** Because I have a high income and value being successful, the promise of feeling energized and looking good aligns with my desire to project competence. However, I'd want more information about the product's ingredients and potential side effects before making a definite purchase.
