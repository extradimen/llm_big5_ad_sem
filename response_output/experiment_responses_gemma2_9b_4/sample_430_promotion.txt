My reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad *interesting* as it speaks to a desire for energy and looking good.  While "good" isn't a strong feeling, I can see how it might appeal to some people. However, I don't personally find it *attractive* or particularly *like* it.

* **Purchase Intention:** Because the ad emphasizes "stay energized" and "look your best," it plays on aspirations many people have. This makes me *intend* to try it and likely *try to buy it*.  However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it regularly without further information about its ingredients or effectiveness. 


I tend to be practical and prefer products with clear benefits, not just general claims like "stay energized."
