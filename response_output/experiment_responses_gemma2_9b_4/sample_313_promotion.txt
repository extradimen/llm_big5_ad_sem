**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't personally connect with it enough to say I like it or find it attractive.  My reserved personality might make me less receptive to advertising that focuses on outward appearances. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The idea of staying energized appeals to me, especially considering my tendency to worry and get nervous easily. Because of this, I would be willing to try the product and potentially buy it if I saw good reviews or heard positive feedback from others (due to my general distrust).  However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it based on the ad alone.
