**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message clear and appealing (good), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it (like, interesting, attractive).  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I worry a lot (Strongly Agree) and get nervous easily (Strongly Agree), I tend to be cautious about new products. However, the promise of staying energized and looking my best aligns with some of my desires. So, while I wouldn't rush out to buy it immediately, I would likely try the product if given the opportunity or see if others recommend it.
