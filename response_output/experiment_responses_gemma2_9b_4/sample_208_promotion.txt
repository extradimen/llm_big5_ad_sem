**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent. However, I wouldn't call it particularly attractive or something I love.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I might try the product out of curiosity (score 1 for "try"), I'm not immediately planning to buy it (score 1 for "intend").  I'd consider buying it if I saw it at a good price or if someone recommended it, but it's not on my radar right now. 



Let me know if you want me to analyze any other ads!
