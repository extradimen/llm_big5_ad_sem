Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad's message a bit simplistic and fear-mongering. "Tired and dull"? That doesn't really appeal to me. While I find it somewhat interesting because it tries to tap into insecurities, I don't think it's a good advertisement overall. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  Because of the ad's tactics, I wouldn't be rushing out to buy this drink. However, if I happened to see it at the store and was feeling particularly tired, I might consider giving it a try. I wouldn't intentionally go out of my way to purchase it.
