Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting because it promises benefits ("stay energized," "look your best"), I don't particularly like it or find it attractive.  The language feels a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention. 
* **Purchase Intention:** Because of my personality, I'm naturally cautious and distrustful (Strongly Disagree with "I am generally trusting"). The ad doesn't provide any specific details about the ingredients or how it works, which makes me hesitant. However,  the promise of feeling energized and looking good is appealing enough that I might consider trying it if I saw it in a store. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
