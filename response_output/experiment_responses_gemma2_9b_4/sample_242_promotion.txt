**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't necessarily *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The claims seem a bit generic. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try this product because the claim of staying energized appeals to me (as a blue-collar worker who needs to be alert). However, I wouldn't immediately buy it without trying first.  I'd consider buying it if I found it effective and liked the taste. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
