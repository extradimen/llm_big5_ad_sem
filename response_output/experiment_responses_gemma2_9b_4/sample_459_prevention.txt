**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is interesting and somewhat well-constructed, I find it a bit manipulative. The "without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull" message plays on insecurities, which I'm not particularly receptive to. It doesn't feel very original or trustworthy. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm  likely to try the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly. The ad hasn't convinced me that this drink is a necessity for me.
