**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (3):** I find the ad's message somewhat appealing because it directly addresses potential negative consequences of not using the product.  
    * **Interesting (2):** The ad is mildly interesting as it plays on common insecurities about tiredness and dullness. 
    * **Good (2):** I don't think it's a particularly well-crafted or memorable ad, but it gets its point across.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad doesn't use visuals or language that I find particularly attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** While the ad might make me slightly more aware of this product, I wouldn't be immediately inclined to buy it.
    * **Try (1):**  I might be willing to try the drink if it was offered to me or if I saw positive reviews from people I trust.
    * **Consider (3):** If I were experiencing fatigue or felt self-conscious about my appearance, I might seriously consider purchasing this product.
