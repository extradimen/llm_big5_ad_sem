**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message feels generic and doesn't stand out.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product. The claim of "staying energized" appeals to me, and I might be willing to give it a shot if it aligns with my health goals. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further research or information about its ingredients and effects.  



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
