**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message clear and appealing (score of 4 for "good"), I wouldn't say it's particularly captivating or exciting (scores of 2 for "like" and "attractive").  I think it's interesting enough to warrant a second glance.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad successfully piques my interest, leading me to consider purchasing the product (score of 3 for "consider"). I'm even willing to give it a try (score of 1 for "try") and might just buy it depending on other factors like price and reviews.
