**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good in its simplicity, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The message relies on a common fear tactic ("look dull") which I tend to disregard.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or plan a purchase. My income level allows me to be selective about products, and I'm more likely to invest in things that directly address specific needs or offer proven benefits rather than rely on vague claims like feeling "tired" or "dull."
