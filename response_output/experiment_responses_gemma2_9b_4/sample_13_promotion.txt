**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I don't find the ad particularly "attractive," it does seem interesting and I believe it's a decent promotion. It's not something that stands out as amazing, but it gets the point across.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my tendency to worry (Agree) and get nervous easily (Strongly Agree), I might be drawn to products promising increased energy and confidence.  While I don't intend to buy this product immediately, I'd likely try it if given the opportunity or see it on sale.  I might even consider buying it regularly if the product lived up to its claims and genuinely helped me feel more energized.
