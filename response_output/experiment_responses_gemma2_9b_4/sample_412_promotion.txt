**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it promises benefits that are important to me (energy and appearance). However, I wouldn't call it particularly "good" or "attractive."  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad piques my interest, I'm likely to buy this product. The promise of energy and looking good aligns with my desire to be sociable and make a good impression.
