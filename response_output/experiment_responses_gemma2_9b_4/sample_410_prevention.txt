**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  and plays on insecurities. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product because the ad raises concerns about feeling tired and looking dull. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it or even try it without further research. My tendency to be careless means I might not carefully evaluate other options or potential side effects. The ad appeals to my worry about looking dull but doesn't convince me enough to make a definite purchase decision.
