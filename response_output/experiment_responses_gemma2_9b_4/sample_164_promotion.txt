**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the message of feeling energized and looking good appealing, it's not particularly "likeable" or "attractive" to me. It feels a bit generic.  I think it's interesting enough to warrant a second glance.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad focuses on superficial benefits, I'm unlikely to immediately purchase the product. However, I might try it if I see it at a good price or if there are testimonials from people I trust.
