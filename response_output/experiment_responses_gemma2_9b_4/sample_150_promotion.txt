  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [2, 3, 2, 1],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
} 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't personally connect with it. The claims of "stay energized" and "look your best" feel a bit generic and don't particularly appeal to me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

The ad piques my curiosity enough that I might try the product.  However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it.  Before buying, I'd want more specific information about the ingredients, health benefits (if any), and perhaps some customer reviews. The "consider" score reflects this cautious approach.
