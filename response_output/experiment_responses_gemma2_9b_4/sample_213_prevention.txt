**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I wouldn't call it attractive. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink is a common tactic that resonates with me because I value being energetic and presentable.  However, my "careless" tendency might lead me to forget about purchasing it unless it's readily available or heavily promoted.
