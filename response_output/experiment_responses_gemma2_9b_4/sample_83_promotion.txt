**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat attractive and interesting. The promise of staying energized and looking your best appeals to me on a basic level. However, I wouldn't call it particularly "good" or something I actively enjoy.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would definitely intend to purchase this product and likely try it out based on the ad alone. My outgoing personality makes me more likely to try new things, and the promise of feeling energized aligns with my desire to be sociable and active.
