**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and potentially attractive, I don't particularly like it or think it's good. The "tired and dull" imagery feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurity. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product out of curiosity or if I felt particularly tired/stressed, but I wouldn't actively try to buy it nor intend to make it a regular purchase. My distrusting nature would likely lead me to research alternatives before committing.
