**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it plays on a common fear of looking tired and dull.  While I don't necessarily agree with the implied connection to a drink, it's a relatable concept.
    * It's not something I particularly **like (2)** or find **attractive (1)**. The ad feels somewhat generic and lacks any unique selling points that would grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * I might actually **intend to purchase (1)** this product out of curiosity, especially if it's advertised in a place where I regularly shop.  
    * However, I wouldn't actively **try to buy (1)** it. Before doing so, I would need more information about the drink's ingredients and potential benefits. 
    * I would likely **consider buying (2)** it if there was a good deal or promotion, but I wouldn't prioritize purchasing it over other needs.
