**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is okay, not particularly engaging.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of energy and looking good is somewhat intriguing.
    * **Good (2):**  It's a decent ad, but nothing special. 
    * **Attractive (1):** I don't find the ad visually or conceptually appealing.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying it if I was running low on energy drinks.
    * **Try (1):**  It's not a product I'd actively seek out, but I wouldn't say no if someone offered me one.
    * **Consider (3):** If the price was right and I really needed a boost, it would be on my list of options.


**Rationale:**

As a reserved person who worries a lot,  I'm not easily swayed by flashy advertising claims. While the promise of energy and looking good is appealing, I tend to be cautious about products like this. I'd need more information about the ingredients and potential side effects before making a purchase.
