**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't really appeal to me aesthetically.  I'm not sure how much weight I put on "looking your best" as a priority. However, the promise of staying energized does resonate with me â€“ someone who is over 60 could certainly appreciate that! So, while I wouldn't rush out to buy it, I might consider trying it if given the opportunity.
