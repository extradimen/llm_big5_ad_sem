**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's good to some extent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "tired and dull" imagery feels a bit exaggerated and doesn't resonate with me strongly. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am inclined to try this product because of the potential benefit it promises. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately without further research or information about its effectiveness and ingredients.  I would definitely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or experienced firsthand the claimed benefits.
