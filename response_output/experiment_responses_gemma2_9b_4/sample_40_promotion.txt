  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad fairly attractive and interesting, I wouldn't call it "good" in the sense of being particularly clever or innovative. It relies on common marketing tropes.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As a talkative and sociable person who enjoys trying new things, I am likely to give this drink a try based on the ad alone. However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to purchasing it regularly without further research and perhaps a free sample. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
