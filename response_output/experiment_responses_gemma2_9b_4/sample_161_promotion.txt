**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I don't find the ad particularly "attractive," I think it's interesting and decent.  The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely intend to purchase this product, at least try it once. However, given my personality (reserved, cautious), I wouldn't automatically commit to buying it without further consideration or perhaps seeing testimonials from people like me. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
