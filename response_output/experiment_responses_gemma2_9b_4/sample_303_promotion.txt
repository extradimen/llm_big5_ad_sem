**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    *  **I like the ad. (2):** While not overly enthusiastic, I find the simplicity of the message appealing. It's straightforward and focuses on benefits.
    * **I think the ad is interesting. (3):** The promise of staying energized and looking your best is something that catches my attention. 
    * **I believe the ad is good. (2):**  It's a decent ad, but I wouldn't say it's particularly groundbreaking or memorable. 
    * **I find the ad attractive. (1):** The ad lacks visual appeal or anything that would draw me in aesthetically.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **I intend to purchase this product. (1):** I might be interested, but I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it. 
    * **I will try to buy this product. (1):**  If I saw this drink readily available and was in need of a pick-me-up, I might give it a shot.
    * **I will consider buying this product. (3):** The ad has planted a seed, so if I saw the product again or heard positive reviews, I'd definitely be more inclined to try it.
