**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically.  The "tired and dull" message resonates with my worry about appearing successful, so I might be inclined to try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright. My distrustful nature would make me want to research more before committing.
