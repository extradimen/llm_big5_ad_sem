**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting due to its direct approach, I don't personally like it. It feels somewhat manipulative and relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") rather than appealing to genuine needs or desires.  I also don't find it attractive or believe it's a good advertisement overall. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of the negative feelings I have towards the ad, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase the product or even try it. However, if I were experiencing fatigue or feeling self-conscious about my appearance, I might consider buying it out of desperation.
