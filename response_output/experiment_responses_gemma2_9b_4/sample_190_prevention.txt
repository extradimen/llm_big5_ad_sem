**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message somewhat persuasive (good), it's not something that immediately grabs my attention or makes me feel strongly positive about it. I think it's interesting because it appeals to a fear of looking dull, which might resonate with some people. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try the product because the ad plays on a common concern (tiredness/dullness). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without more information about its ingredients or effectiveness. I would definitely consider buying it if it had positive reviews or recommendations from trusted sources.
