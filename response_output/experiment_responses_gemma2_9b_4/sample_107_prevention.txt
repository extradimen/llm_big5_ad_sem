**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (score 3) and think it's decent (score 2), I don't particularly like it (score 2) or find it attractive (score 1).  The message feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and dullness.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad makes me slightly nervous (I get nervous easily), and because I tend to be careless, I might buy the drink out of impulse (score 1 for intend and try). However,  I'm not fully committed to buying it â€“ I would likely consider other options before making a purchase (score 3 for consider).
