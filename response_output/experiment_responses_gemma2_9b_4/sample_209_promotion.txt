**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the message straightforward and appealing ("stay energized and look your best"), it lacks a unique hook or memorable element. 
    * It's **interesting** because it speaks to common desires, but not particularly **good** due to its generic nature.
    *  It's **attractive** enough to warrant further consideration.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to **purchase** this product based on the ad alone. However, my trust levels are low, so I wouldn't immediately commit to trying it. I'd need more information about the ingredients, potential side effects, and perhaps testimonials before making a decision.
