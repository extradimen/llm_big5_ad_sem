**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't personally *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*. The language feels a bit general and doesn't grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to *intend* to purchase this product and would also *try* it. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it as a regular part of my routine. My cautious nature (high "worry" and "nervous easily" scores) means I need more convincing before making a commitment to a new product.
