**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** While not dislikeful, the ad doesn't particularly appeal to me. It's generic and lacks something unique to grab my attention.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of staying energized and looking your best is somewhat intriguing, as these are things I care about to some extent. 
    * **Good (2):** It gets the basic message across clearly, but it's not particularly well-crafted or memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad doesn't have any visual or language elements that I find particularly appealing.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** I'm likely to try the product, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. 
    * **Try (1):** If I saw this drink readily available and in a situation where I needed a boost, I might give it a shot.
    * **Consider (3):**  I'd probably weigh the pros and cons before making a purchase decision based on factors like price, ingredients, and reviews. 



My reserved nature and tendency to be careful mean I wouldn't jump into buying something new without some thought and research. The ad itself doesn't provide enough compelling information for me to make a hasty decision.
