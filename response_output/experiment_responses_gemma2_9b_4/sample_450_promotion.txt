**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The claims about energy and looking your best are common and don't stand out.  As a reserved person,  I'm less likely to be swayed by flashy or overly enthusiastic advertising.

* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad piques my curiosity enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without more information about the ingredients and potential side effects. My tendency to worry and get nervous easily makes me cautious about trying new things.
