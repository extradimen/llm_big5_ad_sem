**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't personally like it or find it particularly attractive. The use of fear-based language ("you may feel tired and look dull") doesn't resonate with me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product if I was already experiencing fatigue or felt self-conscious about my appearance. However, the ad alone isn't enough to make me actively want to purchase it.
