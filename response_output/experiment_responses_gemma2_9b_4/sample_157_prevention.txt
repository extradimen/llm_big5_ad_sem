**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** I find the ad's message somewhat appealing because it speaks to a desire for energy and vitality.
    * **Interesting (2):** While the message is common, it's not particularly unique or captivating.
    * **Good (4):** I think the ad effectively uses fear-based language ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") to create a sense of urgency.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad doesn't have any visually appealing elements or creative storytelling that would make me find it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm unlikely to purchase this product based solely on this ad.
    * **Try (1):**  I might be willing to try the drink if there was a special promotion or if I saw positive reviews from people I trust. 
    * **Consider (3):** If I were experiencing fatigue regularly and couldn't pinpoint a cause, I might consider this product as a potential solution.
