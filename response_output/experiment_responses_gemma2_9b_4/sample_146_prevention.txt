**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* attempt to connect with potential customers by highlighting insecurities (tiredness, dullness), I don't personally find it particularly *attractive*. The language feels a bit manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might *try* this product based on the ad alone because it addresses a concern I sometimes have (feeling tired). However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness.  I would definitely *consider* buying it if I saw positive reviews or recommendations from people I trust.
