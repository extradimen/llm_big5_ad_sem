**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** While not particularly appealing, the ad's straightforward message about feeling tired and looking dull resonates with a concern I might have about aging.
    * **Interesting (2):**  The ad is simple and gets its point across, but it lacks any real intrigue or creativity. 
    * **Good (2):** The ad does effectively convey its intended message, which is to highlight the potential negative consequences of not using the product.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad's design and messaging aren't particularly attractive to me. I find it rather generic and uninspired.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  The ad might pique my curiosity enough to consider trying the product, but I wouldn't actively seek it out based solely on this advertisement. 
    * **Try (1):** As mentioned above, I might give the product a shot if I came across it in the store or saw another, more compelling advertisement.
    * **Consider (3):** If I were facing genuine fatigue or concerns about my appearance, I would seriously consider purchasing this drink as a potential solution.
