Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad to be decent but not particularly captivating. It's straightforward and conveys its message clearly ("stay energized, look your best"). However, it lacks something special that would make me strongly like or find it attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention:** The combination of "energized" and "look your best" appeals to my desire for self-improvement and feeling good. I am likely to try this product based on the ad alone. Since I tend to be careless and worry a lot, perhaps this drink would help me feel more in control.
