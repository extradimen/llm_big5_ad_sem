**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and relies on fear tactics.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

Despite my reservations about the ad, I might try this product out of curiosity. I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it long-term unless I experienced a significant benefit from it. However, I'd consider buying it if it was heavily discounted or promoted with a free trial.
