**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat appealing and interesting because of its straightforward message, I don't think it's particularly groundbreaking or well-executed. It relies on common marketing tropes ("look your best") without offering much unique information.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product based on the promise of increased energy. However, my decision would ultimately depend on factors like price, reviews, and personal experience with similar products. I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately, but I'd be open to giving it a shot. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of my response!
