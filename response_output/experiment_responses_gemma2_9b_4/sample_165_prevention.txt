**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is not flashy or particularly attractive to me (1), I find it interesting because it appeals to a common desire to look and feel energetic (3). I think it's a decent advertisement overall (2), but not exceptional. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me *consider* trying the product (3) because the promise of feeling less tired and looking more vibrant is appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it right away (1) or even actively *try* it (1). I'd likely want to see more information about the product and its ingredients before making a decision. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
