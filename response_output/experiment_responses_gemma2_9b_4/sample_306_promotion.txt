**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think highly of it.  The claims about energy and looking good are common and not very unique. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad appeals to a desire for energy and appearance (things that matter to me), I would likely try this product at least once. However, I wouldn't necessarily plan on making it a regular purchase until I've tried it and seen if it delivers on its promises. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my responses!
