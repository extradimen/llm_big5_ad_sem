**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims about energy and appearance are common in advertisements and don't stand out to me.

* **Purchase Intention:**  I might try this product because the ad piqued my curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately. I would likely consider buying it based on reviews or personal recommendations before making a decision. 


My personality traits, such as being cautious and worrying a lot, make me less impulsive about purchases.  I prefer to carefully weigh options before committing.
