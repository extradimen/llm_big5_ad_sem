**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. The "prevention" angle resonates slightly due to my tendency to worry a lot. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to consider purchasing this product based on the ad alone because it plays on my anxieties about appearing tired and dull. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to buy it right away.  My talkative nature might lead me to ask others for recommendations before making a decision.
