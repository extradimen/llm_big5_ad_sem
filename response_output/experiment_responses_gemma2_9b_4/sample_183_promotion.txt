**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message appealing (stay energized and look your best), it doesn't particularly excite me. It feels like a common claim many products make.  I find it interesting enough to read, but not groundbreaking or particularly well-crafted.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given my personality traits, especially my tendency to worry and my desire to be helpful and unselfish, I might be drawn to products that promise health benefits or contribute to a positive image. The ad's emphasis on looking your best aligns with this desire.  Since the ad doesn't provide specific details about ingredients or benefits, I wouldn't immediately purchase it. However, if presented with more information and testimonials, I would definitely consider trying it.
