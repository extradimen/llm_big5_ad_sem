**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it very attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  which doesn't sit well with my trusting nature.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of the wording, I am hesitant to immediately purchase or even try the product. However, I would consider buying it if there were testimonials or other information that made me feel more confident in its effectiveness.  My worry about feeling tired and dull could make me susceptible to this type of advertising.
