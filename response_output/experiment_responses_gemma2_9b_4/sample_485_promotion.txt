{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [2, 3, 2, 1],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at marketing, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The claim of "looking your best" feels superficial and not something I prioritize.  However, the promise of staying energized is appealing as a student. So while I wouldn't rush out to buy it, I might try it if I see it available and am looking for an energy boost.   I wouldn't actively seek it out though.
