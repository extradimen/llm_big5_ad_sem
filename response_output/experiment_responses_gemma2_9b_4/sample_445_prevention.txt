**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is simple and gets the point across. I find the message relatable as tiredness can be a common issue. However, it's not particularly exciting or memorable.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The claim of feeling "dull" piques my curiosity. It makes me wonder what this drink could offer.
    * **Good (2):** The ad effectively uses fear-based messaging to highlight a problem and suggest a solution. 
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad is not visually appealing or particularly enticing.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I'm likely to try this drink based on the ad alone, but I wouldn't be rushing out to buy it immediately. 
    * **Try (1):** The ad has sparked my interest enough to want to give the product a chance.
    * **Consider (3):** If I see the drink at the store and remember the ad, I would definitely consider purchasing it.  



As someone who values being helpful and doing a thorough job, I might be more persuaded by an advertisement that explains the ingredients or benefits of the drink in more detail rather than just focusing on the negative consequences of not drinking it.
