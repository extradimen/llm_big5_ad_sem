**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing ("stay energized and look your best"), it's not particularly groundbreaking or creative.  It relies on common marketing tropes. I think it's good but not outstanding.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough to try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away without more information about its ingredients, taste, and potential side effects. I would definitely consider buying it if it seemed like a healthy and effective option.
