**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it promises a benefit (staying energized and looking good) that many people desire. While I believe it's a decent attempt at advertising, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product because the advertised benefits appeal to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately. I would likely consider trying it after seeing more information about the ingredients and reviews from other people.
