**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and attractive because it uses a common fear (looking dull/tired) to grab attention. While I don't think it's necessarily "good" advertising, it does its job of getting noticed. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product based on the ad alone. As someone who worries a lot, the idea of avoiding feeling tired and looking dull is appealing. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without further research or perhaps seeing testimonials.   


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
