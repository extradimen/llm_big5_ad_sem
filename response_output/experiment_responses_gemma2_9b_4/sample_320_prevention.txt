**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The "look dull" phrase feels a bit shallow and doesn't resonate with my values of being helpful and genuine.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I worry a lot, the ad's message about feeling tired might trigger some anxiety. This could lead me to consider buying the product as a potential solution. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it or even try it without further research and information about its ingredients and effects.
