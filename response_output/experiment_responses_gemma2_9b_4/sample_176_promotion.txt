**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't call it particularly attractive or something I strongly like. The message is straightforward and appeals to common desires for energy and appearance.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am inclined to try this product. The claim of increased energy and improved looks are appealing, especially considering my demographic and potential need for both. However, I wouldn't automatically purchase it without further research or seeing testimonials.
