**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly attractive.  The message is a bit basic and relies on common fears (feeling tired, looking dull).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I tend to be helpful and unselfish, and the ad plays on those desires by suggesting this drink will make me more appealing to others, I might consider buying it. However, my skepticism towards advertising ("I am generally distrusting") means I wouldn't immediately rush out to purchase it. I'd probably try it first.
