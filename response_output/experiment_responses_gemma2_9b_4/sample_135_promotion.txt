**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because the promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without trying it first. I would definitely consider buying it if I found it effective. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
