**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it's not particularly likable or attractive to me. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull").  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservations about the ad's tactics, I would likely consider buying the product. It appeals to a desire for feeling energetic and looking good, which are things I value. However, I wouldn't be rushing out to buy it immediately. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
