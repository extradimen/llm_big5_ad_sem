Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is somewhat interesting (it presents a common fear) and potentially good in its simplicity, I don't find it particularly likeable or attractive.  The language feels a bit manipulative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely try this product due to the implied benefit of feeling less tired and looking more vibrant. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it outright without further research on ingredients and potential side effects. I would definitely consider buying it if it were recommended by someone I trust or had positive reviews from reliable sources. 


As a reserved individual with a postgraduate degree, I tend to be cautious about claims made in advertising and prefer to gather more information before making a purchase decision.
