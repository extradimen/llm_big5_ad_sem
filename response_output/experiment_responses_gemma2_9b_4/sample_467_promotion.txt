**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad fairly appealing because it promises both energy and attractiveness, which are things many people (myself included) value. It's not groundbreaking, but it gets the point across clearly. 
* **Purchase Intention:** I am likely to buy this product at least once. The promise of feeling energized and looking good is tempting, especially if it fits within my budget. However, I wouldn't be a loyal customer without further testing and seeing if it genuinely delivers on its claims.  




Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
