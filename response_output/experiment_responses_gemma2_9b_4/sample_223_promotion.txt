**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be decent, not overly compelling but not unpleasant either. It's interesting enough to grab my attention, and I believe it conveys a clear message. However, it doesn't stand out as particularly attractive or well-executed.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me consider buying the product, especially because the promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to my desire for self-improvement. While not immediately convinced, I would likely try the product based on this advertisement.
