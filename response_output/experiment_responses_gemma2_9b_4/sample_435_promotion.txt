* **Interesting:**  The focus on energy and appearance is something that might catch my attention. 
* **Good:** It makes a clear claim about the product's benefits without being overly complex. 
* **Attractive:**  I wouldn't say it's particularly "attractive" visually, but the message itself is appealing to someone like me who wants to be seen as energetic and confident.

* **Intend to purchase:** I am likely to buy this product because the ad speaks to my desire to project a positive image and have energy.
* **Try:**  Given my tendency to trust others and openness to new things, I'd probably give it a shot.
* **Consider:** While I'm leaning towards buying it, there's a chance I might weigh other options or compare prices before making a final decision.
