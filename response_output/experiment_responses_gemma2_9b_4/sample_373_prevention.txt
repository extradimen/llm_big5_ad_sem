**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and potentially good in its simplicity, I don't particularly *like* it or find it attractive. The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") feels a bit manipulative and relies on insecurity rather than genuine value proposition.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might pique my curiosity enough to *try* the product, but I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it outright. However, if I were facing a period of tiredness or self-consciousness (which is unlikely given my emotional stability), I would *consider* buying it as a temporary solution.
