**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it uses a common fear ("looking dull") to grab attention. 
    * While not necessarily "good" in terms of ethical persuasion, I acknowledge its effectiveness as an ad **(2)**.  
    * I wouldn't call it particularly **attractive (2)** or something I actively **like (2)**.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * The ad makes me **intend to purchase (1)** the product because it plays on my worry about looking tired/dull. 
    * I would definitely **try (1)** it at least once, given the "without this you may..." implication.  
    * However, I'm not entirely convinced and would **consider (2)** other options before committing to regular purchases.
