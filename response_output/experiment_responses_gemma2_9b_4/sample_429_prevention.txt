**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent in its delivery, I don't personally find it very likable or attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative, which makes me slightly wary.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright based on this advertisement alone. I would likely need more information about the product and its ingredients before making a decision. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
