**Explanation:**

* **I like the ad:** I'm not sure how much I *like* it, but it does get my attention. 
* **Interesting:** The promise of staying energized and looking good is something that piques my interest.  
* **Good:** It's a simple message that seems clear and easy to understand.
* **Attractive:** Not particularly attractive visually, but the content is appealing enough.

* **Intend to purchase:** I'm thinking about trying it. 
* **Try:**  I might pick it up if I see it at the store.
* **Consider buying:** It depends on the price and what else is available. I'd need more information before making a decision.



As a talkative person who values being helpful, I wouldn't necessarily be drawn to this ad because of its focus on personal appearance.  However, the promise of "staying energized" might be appealing, especially if it's presented in a way that emphasizes feeling better overall rather than just looking good.
