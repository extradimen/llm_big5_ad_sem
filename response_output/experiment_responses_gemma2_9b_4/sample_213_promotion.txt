**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be fairly decent. It's not particularly groundbreaking, but the message is clear and easy to understand. I wouldn't say it's *bad*, but it doesn't really grab my attention either. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to purchase this product. The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. As a busy manager, I'm always looking for ways to stay on top of things, and the ad suggests this drink could help with that.
