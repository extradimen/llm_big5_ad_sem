**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad somewhat appealing. It's not groundbreaking or particularly unique, but it uses language that resonates with my desire to look and feel good. The focus on "staying energized" and "looking your best" aligns with my fast-paced lifestyle and ambition.  

* **Purchase Intention:** Because I am always looking for ways to improve my performance and appearance, I'm definitely inclined to try this drink. While I wouldn't necessarily commit to purchasing it immediately without trying it first, the ad has piqued my interest enough that I would consider adding it to my routine.
