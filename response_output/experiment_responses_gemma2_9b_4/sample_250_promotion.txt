**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat appealing (score of 3 for "I like the ad"), I don't find it particularly interesting or groundbreaking.  The claims are common in this type of advertisement and don't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of staying energized and looking good is tempting, so I'd likely try the product (score of 1 for "intend to purchase"). However, as someone who tends to be careless and gets nervous easily, I might not follow through with a regular purchase without further convincing or positive reviews. There's a chance I'll consider buying it again (score of 3 for "consider") if the initial experience is satisfactory.
