**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally like it or find it particularly attractive. The language feels generic and doesn't really grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad, I *would* intend to purchase this product and try it out.  The promise of energy and looking "your best" is appealing. However, I wouldn't be actively seeking it out â€“ I'd consider buying it if it was conveniently available or if there was a stronger promotion. 



My personality traits likely influence these scores:

* **Highly Original:** I'm drawn to new ideas and products, but the ad lacks originality.
* **Worries A Lot:**  I might be cautious about consuming something new without more specific information about ingredients and potential side effects.
* **Helpful & Unselfish:** I might be influenced by a testimonial from someone I trust or if the product is marketed as having a positive social impact.
