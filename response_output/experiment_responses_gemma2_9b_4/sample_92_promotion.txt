**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The claim of "looking your best" feels a bit superficial and doesn't strongly resonate with me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product because it promises energy, which is something I value. However, I wouldn't be actively seeking it out. I would likely consider buying it if it were conveniently available or offered at a good price. 


My personality traits, such as being reserved and original, lead me to be less swayed by typical promotional appeals that focus on social acceptance or outward appearances.  I prioritize practicality and genuine benefits over fleeting trends or superficial enhancements.
