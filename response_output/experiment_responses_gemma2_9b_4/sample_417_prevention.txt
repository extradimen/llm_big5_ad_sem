**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt to grab attention, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The use of fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") feels a bit manipulative. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me somewhat curious about the product, so I might try it. However, I wouldn't immediately rush to buy it without more information about its ingredients and benefits. I'm also prone to worry (as indicated in my personality traits), so the possibility of negative side effects might make me hesitate.
