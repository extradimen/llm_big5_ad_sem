**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. I'm not drawn to flashy promotions, so I wouldn't find it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me *consider* buying the product because it promises energy and a good appearance - things that are relevant to me in my daily life. However, I would likely only *try* it after seeing more information or reviews. I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it based on this ad alone.
