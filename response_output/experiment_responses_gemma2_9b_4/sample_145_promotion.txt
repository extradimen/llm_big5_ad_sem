**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be mildly interesting and decent in its execution. It's not particularly captivating or groundbreaking, but it gets the message across clearly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I find the concept appealing (staying energized and looking my best), I'm likely to try this product first before committing to a regular purchase.  I tend to be cautious about new products due to my personality trait of "generally trusting."
