**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and doesn't particularly stand out, I find it somewhat appealing. The promise of energy and looking good are relatable to me.  However, it's not something that grabs my attention strongly or makes me think highly of it as a well-crafted advertisement.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider trying the product. It's likely I would purchase it if I was in need of an energy boost and saw it readily available.  I wouldn't actively seek it out, though.



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
