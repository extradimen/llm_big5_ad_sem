**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* attempt at promoting the drink, I don't personally find it particularly *likeable* or *attractive*. The claims about staying energized and looking your best feel a bit generic and don't strongly resonate with me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad piqued my interest, I might be inclined to *try* the product. However, I wouldn't immediately *intend* to buy it without further research or information about its specific ingredients and potential benefits. Given my reserved nature and preference for thoroughness, I would likely *consider* purchasing it after evaluating reviews and comparing it to other options.
