**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it's not particularly attractive to me. The use of fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") doesn't resonate strongly. My outgoing personality might make me more receptive to ads that emphasize social benefits rather than negative consequences. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely try the product based on the ad alone, but wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away. I'm open to trying new things, especially if they promise a benefit like increased energy and a more appealing appearance. However, I'd need more information about the product before committing to a purchase.
