**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The claims seem generic and don't stand out.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be inclined to try this product because the promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without further research and maybe trying a sample first. There are many other drinks with similar claims, so I'd need more convincing before committing to a regular purchase.
