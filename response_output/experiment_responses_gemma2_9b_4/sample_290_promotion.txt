**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its construction, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or feel "attractive."  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The claim of increased energy and looking your best appeals to me. Since I am generally outgoing and sociable (though reserved at times), these benefits could be helpful in social situations. However, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it. I'd likely try it first to see if it lives up to its claims.
