**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad appealing enough (3), but not exceptionally so. It's interesting (2) because it promises a benefit many people seek (energy and appearance). While it conveys a decent message (3), I don't find it particularly attractive or eye-catching (2).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given my personality traits,  I'm likely to try this product (1) as I'm open to new things and like to be energetic. There's a good chance I'll intend to purchase it after trying it (1) if it delivers on its promise. However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to buying it without experiencing it firsthand (3).
