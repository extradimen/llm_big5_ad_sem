**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims seem a bit generic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me consider trying the product due to its focus on energy and appearance. However, as someone reserved and not overly trusting of marketing claims, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it. I might try it if I see it on sale or hear positive word-of-mouth.
