**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I wouldn't say I *like* the ad, it does pique my curiosity (interesting) and seems decent enough (good).  It's not particularly eye-catching or attractive to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my anxieties and tendency to worry (agreeing with "I get nervous easily" and "I worry a lot"), I might be drawn to the idea of an energy drink promising to help me look my best every day. 
    * I *intend* to purchase it, but I'd likely try it first before committing to a full buy. 
    *  Ultimately, I would *consider* buying it based on its potential to alleviate some of my worries and anxieties.
