**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I like the ad because it's simple and direct. It catches my attention with the promise of energy and looking good. While not groundbreaking, it's presented in a way that feels approachable.  I find it interesting enough to consider learning more about the product.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me want to try the drink! I'm always looking for ways to boost my energy, and the promise of "looking my best" is appealing. While I wouldn't necessarily commit to purchasing it right away (score 2), I would definitely give it a shot if I saw it at the store.
