**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (2) and think it's decent (2), I don't particularly like it (3) or find it attractive (1). The use of fear ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull")  doesn't appeal to me as a motivator.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I'm inclined to trust others' opinions, if people around me were consistently praising the product, I might try it (1). If their praise was strong and convincing, I'd even consider purchasing it (3). However, based on this ad alone, I wouldn't intend to buy it (1).
