**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be decent and interesting. It's not particularly captivating or beautiful but gets the message across clearly. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me want to try the product. While I don't feel a strong urge to buy it immediately, I would consider purchasing it if I was looking for an energy boost.
