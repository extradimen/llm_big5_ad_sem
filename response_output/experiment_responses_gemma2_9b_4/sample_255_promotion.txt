**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad appealing and interesting, I don't think it's particularly good or outstanding. The claims are common in ads for these types of products.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to purchase this product. The claim of staying energized appeals to me, as someone who worries a lot and sometimes gets nervous easily. I believe it could help me manage those feelings. However, I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy it right away - I would probably try it first.
