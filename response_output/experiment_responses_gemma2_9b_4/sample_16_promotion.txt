**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" feel a bit generic and don't grab my attention strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product because I'm generally trusting and the ad presents a positive image. However,  I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright. I would need more information about the ingredients and potential benefits before making a firm decision.
