} 


Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The language is a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention. 

* **Purchase Intention:** I'm more likely to try this product than buy it outright based on the ad alone.  The claim of "looking your best" might appeal to me, but I need more information about the ingredients or benefits before committing to a purchase.
