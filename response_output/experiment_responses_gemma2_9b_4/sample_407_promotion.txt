Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't call it particularly likeable or attractive. The message is pretty standard for this type of product.

* **Purchase Intention:**  The fact that the ad mentions staying energized and looking your best resonates with me as a young person focused on self-improvement. I would likely try the product and might even consider buying it regularly depending on its actual effectiveness and price.
