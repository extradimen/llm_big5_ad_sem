**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be somewhat appealing because it promises energy and a positive appearance, things that are generally desirable. However, I don't find it particularly groundbreaking or innovative. The language is fairly standard for this type of advertisement.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I like the idea of the product, I wouldn't immediately buy it. I would definitely try it if given the opportunity (like a free sample), and I would consider purchasing it regularly depending on its taste and effectiveness.  The fact that the ad focuses on appearance rather than specific health benefits makes me hesitant to commit right away.
