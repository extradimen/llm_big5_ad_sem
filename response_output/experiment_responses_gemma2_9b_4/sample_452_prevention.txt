**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and believe it's decent (2), I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The scare tactic of "feeling tired and look dull" doesn't resonate with me strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm somewhat intrigued by the product (3). However, as someone who tends to be cautious and worries a lot, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it (1) or even try it (1). I'd likely research more about the drink and its ingredients before making a decision.
