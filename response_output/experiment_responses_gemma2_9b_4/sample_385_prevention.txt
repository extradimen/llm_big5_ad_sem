**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I wouldn't call it particularly *attractive*. The message relies on fear tactics ("feel tired and look dull"), which don't resonate with me personally.  I tend to worry a lot already, so this kind of advertising exacerbates those feelings rather than appealing to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not finding the ad very attractive, I could see myself *trying* this product out of curiosity. The fear-based message might be enough to pique my interest, and I sometimes make impulsive decisions when I'm feeling nervous (which is frequent). However, I wouldn't *intend* to purchase it right away, nor would I automatically consider buying it without further research or positive reviews.
