**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is interesting and presents a clear message, I don't find it particularly likeable or attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") and relies on fear tactics rather than positive selling points. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm leaning towards trying the product because the ad piqued my curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright.  I'd likely consider buying it after seeing more information or reviews. The "prevention" aspect of the ad appeals to me as someone who tends to worry a little, but I also value originality and effectiveness over quick fixes.
