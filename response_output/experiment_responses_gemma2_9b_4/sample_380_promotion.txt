Here's a brief explanation of my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad interesting and believe it's good in its simplicity. However, I don't find it particularly attractive or something I'd actively seek out to watch repeatedly.
* **Purchase Intention:** The ad piques my interest enough that I might try the product.  I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away, but I would consider it if I saw it in a store.
