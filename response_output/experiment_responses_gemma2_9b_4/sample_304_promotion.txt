**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. It seems a bit generic.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my high income, I could afford this product. The claim about looking your best is appealing to me, and the "stay energized" aspect resonates with my tendency to get nervous easily.  However, I wouldn't immediately buy it without further research or knowing more about the ingredients.
