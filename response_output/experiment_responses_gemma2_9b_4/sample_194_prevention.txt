**Explanation:**


* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad uses a relatable fear (feeling tired and dull), I find it a bit simplistic and lacking in creativity. It's interesting enough to get my attention but doesn't necessarily make me think highly of the product or brand. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might pique my curiosity, leading me to try the product. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without more information about its ingredients, taste, and potential benefits beyond just avoiding tiredness. The "prevention" focus doesn't strongly resonate with me as a proactive individual who prefers to address issues directly rather than focusing on potential outcomes.
