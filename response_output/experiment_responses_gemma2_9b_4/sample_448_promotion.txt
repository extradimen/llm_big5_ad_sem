**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt. However, I don't personally find it very likeable or attractive. The language feels generic and doesn't really grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I wouldn't actively seek out this product,  the promise of feeling energized and looking good does appeal to me. So, I might try it if I see it readily available. However, I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase it based on this ad alone. 


My personality traits, like worrying a lot and being careless, might make me skeptical of quick fixes like energy drinks.  Plus, as someone who values originality, the generic claims in the ad don't resonate with me.
