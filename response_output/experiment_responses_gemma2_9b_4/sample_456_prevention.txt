**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad interesting because it plays on a common insecurity (looking tired and dull), I don't personally like the way it uses fear to sell the product. It feels a bit manipulative, so my scores reflect that.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I get nervous easily and worry about things, the idea of potentially feeling tired and looking dull does concern me. This might push me to try the product, though I'm not fully convinced it would work.  I wouldn't immediately buy it without more information or reviews. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
