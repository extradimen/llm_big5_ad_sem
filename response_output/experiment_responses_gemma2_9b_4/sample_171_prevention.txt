**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message a bit exaggerated ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull"), I think it's interesting (2) because it plays on common insecurities. I also find it attractive (4) due to its simplicity and directness. Overall, I believe it's a decent ad (4). 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product (2) based on the ad alone, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away (1). I would likely consider buying it (3) if I saw positive reviews or experienced personal fatigue. The ad has piqued my interest, but I need more information before making a firm decision.
