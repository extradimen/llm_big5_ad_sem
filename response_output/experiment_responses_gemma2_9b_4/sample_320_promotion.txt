**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or seem overly attractive. The message is common and not especially unique.

* **Purchase Intention:**  The promise of energy and looking good appeals to me. I would likely try the product based on the ad, but I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy it immediately. I might need more information about ingredients or consider other options before making a final decision. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
