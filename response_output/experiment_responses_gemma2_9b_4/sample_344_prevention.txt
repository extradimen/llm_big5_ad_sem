**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad *interesting* (3) because it uses a common fear tactic - looking dull.  It piques my curiosity to know what the drink offers. However, I wouldn't call it particularly *good*, *attractive*, or something I *like*.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I might *intend* to purchase (1) and *try* this product (1) if it were conveniently available and I was seeking an energy boost. The ad's fear tactic could influence me, but it's not a strong enough motivator for immediate action. 
    *  I would *consider* buying it (3) depending on factors like price, reviews, and other potential options.



**Additional Notes:**

As someone who worries a lot and tends to be reserved, I might be more susceptible to the ad's message about feeling tired and looking dull. However, my preference for thoroughness and dislike of carelessness would likely lead me to research the product before purchasing it.
