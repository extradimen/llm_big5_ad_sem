**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly *like* or *attractive* to me. The wording feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink... you may feel tired and look dull.") which makes me wary.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my tendency to worry (Strongly Agree) and get nervous easily (Strongly Agree), the fear-based appeal of the ad does resonate with me. I might *intend* or *try* to purchase the product out of a desire to avoid feeling tired or looking dull. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* it a top priority unless there were other factors influencing my decision (like seeing positive reviews or a good deal).
