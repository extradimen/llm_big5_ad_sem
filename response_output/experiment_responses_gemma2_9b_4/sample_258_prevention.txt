**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, the message doesn't resonate with me personally. I tend to be reserved and worry a lot, so the fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") feels manipulative rather than appealing. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might *consider buying* this product due to my worries about appearing tired or dull. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it immediately or even *try* it right away. I would likely research other options and compare them before making a decision.
