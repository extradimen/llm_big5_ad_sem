**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it appeals to my desire to be perceived as energetic and vibrant. However, I don't necessarily like it or find it attractive. It feels a bit manipulative using fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") to promote their product. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I'm intrigued by the ad's message, I wouldn't immediately purchase this drink.  I might try it if I see it on sale or in a situation where I need a quick energy boost. I'm more likely to consider buying it if there were testimonials from people I trust or if it was presented as a healthier alternative to coffee or sugary drinks.
