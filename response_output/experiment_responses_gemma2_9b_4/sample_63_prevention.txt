**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (3) and think it's *good* (2) in its simplicity, I don't personally find it very *attractive* (1) or particularly *like* it (2).  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider trying this product (3), and I might even give it a go (1), but I wouldn't say I *intend* to purchase it right away (1).  The "tired and dull" language plays on my worry (I worry a lot) about not being at my best, so it piques my curiosity.
