**Explanation:**

While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good* in terms of conveying a clear message, I don't personally find it particularly *attractive*. The "prevention" angle doesn't resonate strongly with me as someone who generally  doesn't worry much. 

I might consider buying this product if I were feeling particularly tired or if the price was right, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.
