**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be decent and somewhat interesting. While it's not particularly captivating, it conveys a clear message that resonates with my desire for efficiency and effectiveness ("stay energized" and "look your best").

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product based on the advertisement. The promise of energy and improved appearance aligns with my values (efficiency). However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to purchasing it outright without further research or trying a sample.
