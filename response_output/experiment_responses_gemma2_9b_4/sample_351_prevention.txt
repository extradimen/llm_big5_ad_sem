**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent overall, I wouldn't say I *like* it. The "tired and dull" imagery feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  I am likely to try the product out of curiosity but wouldn't necessarily make a conscious effort to buy it based solely on this ad.
