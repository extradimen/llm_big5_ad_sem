}

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (score 3) and believe it's somewhat good (score 2), I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "prevention" framing  appeals to my desire to be helpful and avoid negativity, but it also triggers my worry (Agree).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product (score 1) because I trust the message, but wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away.  I would consider buying it (score 2) if I felt genuinely tired or dull, which aligns with my tendency to be sometimes rude and make snap judgments based on feeling (strongly agree). 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of these points!
