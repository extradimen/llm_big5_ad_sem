**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (score 3) and believe it's *good* (score 2), I don't personally *like* it (score 2) or find it particularly *attractive* (score 1). The language feels a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would *intend to purchase* this product (score 1) because the promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I might also only *try it* (score 1) due to my cautious nature (disagree with being trusting). Ultimately, I would *consider buying it* (score 2) depending on other factors like price, availability, and reviews.  



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
