**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad uses somewhat dramatic language ("tired and dull"), I find it interesting because it speaks to a common desire for vitality. I also think it's decent, but not necessarily "good" or particularly attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider trying this drink, and I might even intend to buy it if I see it in the store. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this advertisement alone. 


**Reasoning:**

As someone who worries a lot (Strongly Agree) and gets nervous easily (Agree), the ad's suggestion that this drink prevents feeling "tired and dull" appeals to my desire for stability and energy.  While I'm not typically drawn to health-focused advertising, the simplicity of the message resonates with me.
