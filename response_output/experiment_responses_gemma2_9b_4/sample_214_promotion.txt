**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is simple and easy to understand, I don't find it particularly captivating. It relies on common marketing tropes ("stay energized," "look your best") which feel a bit unoriginal. However, I do think it conveys its message effectively and could be considered decent in terms of overall appeal.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad piques my interest enough to potentially try the product.  Given my personality traits (nervous, worries a lot), I might be drawn to the promise of staying energized. However, I'm not immediately sold on it and would likely need more information about the ingredients and potential benefits before making a definite purchase.
