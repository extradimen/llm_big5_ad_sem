**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad to be somewhat interesting and decent in its message, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think highly of it.  I'm not drawn to overly generic claims about looking your best.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad might pique my interest enough to try the product, but I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it. I'd likely need more information about the ingredients and benefits before making a decision. The "stay energized" part is appealing, as someone who worries a lot,  but the overall message feels too vague.
