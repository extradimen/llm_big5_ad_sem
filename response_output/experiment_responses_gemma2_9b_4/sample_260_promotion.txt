**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message straightforward and clear, it doesn't particularly excite me. It relies on common marketing tropes ("stay energized," "look your best") that feel a bit generic.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough to consider trying the product. My personality leans towards trusting brands (Strongly Agree) and I tend to be original in my choices, so I might be willing to give this drink a shot. However, I wouldn't necessarily "intend" to buy it outright based on this ad alone.  I'd likely want to see more detailed information about the ingredients and potential benefits before making a firm decision.
