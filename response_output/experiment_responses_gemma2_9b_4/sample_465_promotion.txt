**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt at promotion, I don't particularly like it. It doesn't grab my attention strongly or feel particularly attractive.  

* **Purchase Intention:** The ad does make me somewhat interested in trying the product. I wouldn't immediately buy it, but if I saw it again or heard positive word-of-mouth, I might give it a try.
