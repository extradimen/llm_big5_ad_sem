**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its message, I don't particularly like it. It's not unattractive either, but it doesn't grab my attention strongly.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I am a student on a fixed income, even though I might consider buying the product if it were on sale or if I needed a boost of energy, I wouldn't actively seek it out. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
