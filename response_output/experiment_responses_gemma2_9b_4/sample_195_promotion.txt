**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* attempt at appealing to a desire for energy and attractiveness, I don't personally find it particularly *likeable* or *attractive*.  The language feels a bit generic and lacks something that would truly grab my attention. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my personality traits (careless, worrisome), I might be more inclined to try the product out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it right away or make a conscious effort to buy it. I'd probably consider it if I saw it in a store and was feeling impulsive.
