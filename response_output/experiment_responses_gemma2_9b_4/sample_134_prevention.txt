Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's fairly well-constructed, I wouldn't say I *like* it. The "tired and dull" language feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  It doesn't particularly attract me aesthetically either. 
* **Purchase Intention:** This is where things get tricky. While the ad might pique my curiosity,  I'm not immediately jumping to buy this drink. I'd likely try it at least once if offered, but I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone.
