**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it attractive. The language used ("tired," "dull") feels a bit overdramatic and plays on insecurities which I don't particularly like.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me think about trying this product. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away. I'd likely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or experienced some fatigue myself.
