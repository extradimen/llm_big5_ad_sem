**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive, I don't love it. The message is a bit manipulative ("without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull").  It plays on insecurities, which I find slightly off-putting.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of the manipulative nature of the ad, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy the product or even try it. However, if I were experiencing tiredness or feeling down about my appearance, I might consider buying it out of desperation.
