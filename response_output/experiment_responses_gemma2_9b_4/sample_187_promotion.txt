**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't personally find it highly likeable or attractive. The claims are common in this type of advertisement.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given my tendency to worry (Agree), a product promising "looking your best" could appeal to me as a way to potentially feel more confident.  While I wouldn't immediately purchase, I'd likely try it once based on the promise of feeling energized. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific aspect!
