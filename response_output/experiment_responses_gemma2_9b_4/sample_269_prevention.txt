**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good* in its simplicity, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*.  The language feels a bit manipulative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm leaning towards trying this product because the ad does raise a concern about feeling tired and looking dull, which are things I try to avoid. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away and would likely consider other options or wait for more information.
