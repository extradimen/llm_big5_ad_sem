**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I'm not very impressed with the ad. It feels generic and doesn't say anything particularly unique or compelling. While I find it somewhat interesting because it promises energy and good looks, I don't think it's well-made or persuasive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this product because the idea of feeling energized is appealing. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out. My tendency to be careful and worry about potential downsides would make me hesitant to purchase without more information.
