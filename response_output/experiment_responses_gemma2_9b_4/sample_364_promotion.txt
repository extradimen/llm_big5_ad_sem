**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting because it promises energy and good looks, which are things I might be interested in. However, I don't particularly *like* it or find it attractive. It feels a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy this product right away, I would probably *try* it if I saw it at the store.  I'm willing to consider new products, but I'd need more information about its ingredients and effectiveness before making a decision. The "look your best" claim feels vague and doesn't resonate strongly with me personally.
