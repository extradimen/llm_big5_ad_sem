**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** I find the message straightforward and relatable. Everyone wants to feel energized and look good. 
    * **Interesting (2):** It's not particularly groundbreaking or unique, but it gets the point across. 
    * **Good (3):** It's a well-constructed ad that likely reaches its target audience.
    * **Attractive (2):**  The simplicity of the message isn't very eye-catching, but it's not off-putting either.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I'm likely to buy this product if I see it and am in need of a pick-me-up drink. 
    * **Try (1):**  I would definitely give it a try based on the ad alone.
    * **Consider (3):** There are many other drinks like this on the market, so my decision would depend on factors like price and availability. 



I tend to be cautious about new products, but the ad's message is appealing enough that I wouldn't rule it out.
