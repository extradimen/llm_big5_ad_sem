**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad visually appealing (5) and think it's interesting (3) because it appeals to my desire to be energetic and look good. I don't consider it a particularly "good" ad (2) as it relies on common marketing tropes, but I do find it attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While the ad piques my interest, I wouldn't immediately buy the product (1). However, I would likely try it (2) if I saw it at a store or heard more about it from friends. I'm open to trying new things and this ad sparks some curiosity. I would definitely consider buying it (4) if it had good reviews or if I was looking for an energy boost.
