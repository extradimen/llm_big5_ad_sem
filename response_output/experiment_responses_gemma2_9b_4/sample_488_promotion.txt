**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad straightforward and clear (good), it doesn't particularly excite me or stand out as unique (interesting). I think it's visually appealing enough (attractive) but not captivating.
* **Purchase Intention:**  The claim of "staying energized" resonates with me as a busy office worker. The promise of looking good is also appealing. 
   I'm likely to try this product and, depending on my experience, might even purchase it regularly. However, I wouldn't jump to buy it immediately without more information about the ingredients or reviews.
