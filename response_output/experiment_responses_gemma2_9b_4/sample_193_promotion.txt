**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claim of "looking your best" feels a bit superficial and doesn't resonate with my personality.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product based on the promise of staying energized. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without further research or knowing more about its ingredients and effects.  The "looking your best" aspect keeps me from fully committing to a purchase.
