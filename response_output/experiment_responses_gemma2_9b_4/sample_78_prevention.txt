**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its straightforward message, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The fear-based approach doesn't resonate strongly with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly. I'd consider buying it if I were experiencing fatigue and looking for a quick solution. However, my tendency to worry and my preference for thoroughness might lead me to research other options before making a decision.
