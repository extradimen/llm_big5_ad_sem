**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly *like* it. It doesn't grab my attention in a compelling way and I don't find it visually attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me slightly curious about the product, so I might try it. However, I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it based on this ad alone. The wording feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and I need more convincing before I consider buying something based solely on those claims.
