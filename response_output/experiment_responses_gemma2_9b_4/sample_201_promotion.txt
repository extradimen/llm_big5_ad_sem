**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent overall, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough to potentially try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away and would likely consider other options before making a decision.


The ad plays on common desires for energy and looking good, but it lacks specifics that would make me feel confident in its claims. As someone who tends to be reserved and worries a lot, I'd need more convincing information about the product's ingredients and effectiveness.
