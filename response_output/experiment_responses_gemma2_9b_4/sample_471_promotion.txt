Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad interesting (3) because it promises a benefit that many people value: feeling energized and looking their best. However, I don't particularly *like* it (2) or find it attractive (1). The language feels a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention.  
* **Purchase Intention:** While I might consider buying this product (3) due to the potential benefits, I wouldn't actively try to buy it (1) just yet.  I would need more information about the ingredients, health effects, and perhaps see some testimonials before making a decision. 


As someone who tends to be careful (Agree), I'd want to research this product thoroughly before committing to a purchase. My tendency to get nervous easily (Strongly Agree) might also make me hesitant to try something new without more reassurance about its safety and effectiveness.
