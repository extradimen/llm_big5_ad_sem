**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * While the ad uses a common fear tactic ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull."), I find it somewhat interesting (2) because it plays on insecurities. However, I wouldn't call it a "good" ad overall (3) as it relies on manipulation rather than presenting genuine benefits. I also don't find it particularly attractive (2).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  Because I tend to be trusting and worry a lot, the ad might make me consider trying the product (2).  However, my tendency to be original and come up with new ideas makes me less likely to simply follow marketing claims. I'd want to research more about the product before making a decision (1) and wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it (1).
