**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent, I don't personally find it very attractive. The message feels a bit manipulative to me.  I worry a lot, so playing on fears like looking "dull" isn't very appealing. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

Because I tend to be original and come up with new ideas, I wouldn't rely on a simple advertisement to make my purchasing decisions. I would likely try the product once out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly.  I would consider buying it if I had specific concerns about feeling tired or looking dull, but that's not a constant worry for me.
