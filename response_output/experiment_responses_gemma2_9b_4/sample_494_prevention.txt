**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad *interesting* because it uses a bit of fear-mongering to grab attention. I give it a 3.  While I don't love ads that make me feel anxious, this one does pique my curiosity.
    * I think it's a *good* ad in terms of its simplicity and directness. It gets the point across quickly. 2.
    *  I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*. 1 & 2

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * While I'm interested, I don't feel strongly inclined to *intend* to buy this drink right away. 1
    * I might *try* it if I saw it at a store and was feeling tempted. 1
    * I'd probably *consider* buying it if the price was right or if I was really feeling tired one day. 3 



My personality traits influence my response:

* **Outgoing & Sociable:**  I'm more likely to try new things, but not necessarily buy them immediately.
* **Reserved:** This ad doesn't make me feel overly pressured to buy, which is good because I tend to be cautious.
* **Worry a lot:** The fear-based messaging might resonate with my tendency to worry about looking tired and dull.
