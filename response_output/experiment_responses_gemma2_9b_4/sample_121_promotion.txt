Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad generally appealing, it doesn't leave a particularly strong impression. It relies on common promises ("stay energized," "look your best") that don't feel unique or groundbreaking. However, it is well-structured and uses language I understand. 
* **Purchase Intention:** This ad does pique my interest enough to potentially buy the product. My worry is always about trusting new products and brands, but the promise of feeling more energized and confident is appealing.  I'd likely try it first, and if it worked as promised, I would consider making a repeat purchase.
