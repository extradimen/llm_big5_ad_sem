**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message appealing (stay energized and look your best), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or feel unique. The claims seem generic to many similar products.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to purchase this product because  the idea of staying energized is attractive, especially given my tendency to get nervous easily. I might even try it out based on the ad alone. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out without further research or seeing specific benefits related to my needs and lifestyle.
