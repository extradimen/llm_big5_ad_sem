**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its delivery, I wouldn't say I strongly like or find it particularly attractive. It relies on a common fear tactic, which I'm not overly fond of.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider trying the product because it plays on my desire to maintain a youthful appearance and avoid feeling tired. However, as someone who values thoroughness, I'd likely research other options and compare ingredients before committing to a purchase. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
