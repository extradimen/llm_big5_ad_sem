**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's a decent attempt to promote the drink. However, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I might consider buying this product if I saw it in a store and was feeling low on energy,  I wouldn't actively seek it out. The ad doesn't convince me enough to make a purchase decision right now. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
