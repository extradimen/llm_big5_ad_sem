**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive due to its direct appeal to avoiding negative consequences (feeling tired and looking dull), I don't necessarily think it's "good" in terms of being well-crafted or particularly persuasive.  It relies on a common fear tactic.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad's message makes me consider trying the product. However, my high score for intending to purchase suggests that if the drink were readily available and affordable, I would likely give it a try.
