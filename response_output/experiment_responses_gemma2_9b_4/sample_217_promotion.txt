**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" feel generic and don't resonate with my priorities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me curious enough to at least try the product once, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. It depends on other factors like price and availability before I'd consider purchasing it regularly.
