**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I don't find the ad particularly "likeable,"  I think it's interesting because it plays on common anxieties (feeling tired and dull). I believe it's a decent ad in terms of its simplicity and directness. It does grab my attention, but not necessarily in a positive way.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me *consider* buying the product because it appeals to a fear of looking less appealing. I might even *try* it out of curiosity. However,  I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it based on this ad alone. It lacks information about what makes the drink effective or any unique selling points beyond the basic "feel better" promise.
