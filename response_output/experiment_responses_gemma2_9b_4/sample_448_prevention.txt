**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly attractive or likeable. The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") doesn't resonate strongly with me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try the product due to curiosity, but wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it. I would definitely consider buying it if positive reviews or recommendations came up, as my worry about feeling "tired and dull" might lead me to seek a solution. However,  it wouldn't be a top priority for me.
