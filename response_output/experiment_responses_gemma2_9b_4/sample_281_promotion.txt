{

  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 4, 2, 5],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 3]
}
``` 


Here's a breakdown of my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** It's a simple ad that gets the point across. I don't hate it, but it's not particularly memorable. 
    * **Interesting (4):** The promise of staying energized and looking good is appealing.  I'm always looking for ways to feel my best.
    * **Good (2):** It's a decent ad, but it doesn't feel particularly creative or unique. 
    * **Attractive (5):**  The visuals and messaging are visually appealing and target my desire to look good.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I'm likely to buy this drink. The promise of increased energy and improved appearance is something I find valuable. 
    * **Try (2):** I wouldn't just blindly buy it, I'd probably try it first.  Maybe even grab a smaller size to test it out.
    * **Consider (3):** It's definitely on my radar, but other factors like price and availability will influence my final decision.
