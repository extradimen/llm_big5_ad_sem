**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat appealing (attractive and interesting), I don't think it's particularly groundbreaking or well-executed. The claim of "looking your best" is a bit vague and relies on stereotypes. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because the promise of energy boosts appeals to me. However, I wouldn't be immediately rushing to buy it without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness. The ad itself doesn't convince me enough to make a definite purchase decision.



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
