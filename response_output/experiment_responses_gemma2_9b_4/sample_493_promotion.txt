**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it. It feels a bit generic.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The promise of energy and looking good appeals to me, so I would likely purchase this product.  I wouldn't rush to buy it immediately (intend), but I'd definitely give it a try after seeing the product in person or reading more about it (try). There's a possibility I'd consider buying it based on reviews or recommendations from friends.
