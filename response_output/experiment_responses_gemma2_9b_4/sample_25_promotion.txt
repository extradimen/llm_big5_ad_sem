**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** It's not a bad ad, but it doesn't really grab my attention.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of feeling energized and looking good is something that appeals to me on some level. 
    * **Good (2):** It gets the point across clearly enough, but it's not particularly memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad itself isn't visually or conceptually appealing to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might buy it if I was feeling low on energy and saw it in the store, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.
    * **Try (1):** Similar to "intend," I wouldn't go out of my way to try it, but I might be willing to give it a shot if offered.
    * **Consider (3):**  If the price was right and I was in need of a boost, I could see myself considering this drink.



**Reasoning:**

As someone who is generally cautious and tends to worry, I'd be skeptical of claims about quick fixes like "stay energized" and "look your best." The ad doesn't offer any specific details about what the drink contains or how it works, which makes me less trusting.  Additionally, my blue-collar background and limited income might make me prioritize more practical needs over a product like this.
