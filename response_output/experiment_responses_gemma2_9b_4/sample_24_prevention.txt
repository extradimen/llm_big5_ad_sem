**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's okay, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "tired and dull" framing feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product if I was genuinely feeling tired or wanted to look more alert. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or make a purchase decision based solely on this ad.
