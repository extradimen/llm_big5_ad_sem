**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*,  I don't personally *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * **Intend to purchase:** This is a strong "yes" for me. The claim of staying energized and looking your best appeals to me, especially as I strive for efficiency in my managerial role.  
    * **Try to buy:** Again, likely. I'm willing to give the product a shot based on the ad's promise.
    * **Consider buying:** This is a definite possibility. However, since I tend to be *careless*, I might not remember to purchase it or prioritize it over other things.
