**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, but not particularly *like* or *attractive*. It uses common marketing language ("energized," "look your best") that I've seen before.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 

I would likely  *intend to purchase* this product, as the claim of staying energized aligns with my needs as someone with a demanding office job. However, I wouldn't necessarily *try* it immediately, and I'd definitely consider other options based on factors like price, reviews, and ingredients. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
