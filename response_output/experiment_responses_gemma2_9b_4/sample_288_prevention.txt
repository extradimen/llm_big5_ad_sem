**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its directness, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The language used feels a bit hyperbolic and could be perceived as manipulative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product based on the ad. However, my intention to purchase is not strong. I would need more information about the product's ingredients, benefits, and reviews before committing to buying it. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
