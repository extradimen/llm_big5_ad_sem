**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its directness, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given my personality traits (worried, nervous), I might be tempted to try this product as a way to alleviate those feelings of tiredness and dullness. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without more information about the ingredients and potential side effects. I would definitely consider buying it if friends recommended it or if I saw positive reviews.
