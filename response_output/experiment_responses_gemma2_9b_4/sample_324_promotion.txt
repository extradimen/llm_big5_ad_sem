**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and doesn't immediately grab my attention (score of 3 for "like"), I find it interesting due to its promise of energy and looking good (score of 4 for "interesting").  I think it conveys a clear message but wouldn't call it particularly well-made (score of 2 for "good") or visually appealing (score of 3 for "attractive").
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me want to try the product, so I would likely purchase it. (scores of 1 and 1 for "intend" and "try"). However,  I wouldn't commit to buying it immediately without further research or perhaps seeing some testimonials. (score of 2 for "consider").
