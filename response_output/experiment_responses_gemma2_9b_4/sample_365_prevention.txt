**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt, I don't personally find it very likeable or attractive. The "look dull" part feels a bit dramatic and plays on insecurities. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my personality traits (like being careful and prone to worry), I wouldn't immediately jump to buy the product based solely on this ad. However, if I started feeling tired or noticed people commenting on my appearance, I might consider trying it out.  The ad definitely makes me think about the possibility.
