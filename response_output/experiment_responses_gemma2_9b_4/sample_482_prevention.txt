**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (3) and *attractive* (4), I wouldn't say I *like* it (2) or think it's *good* (4). The claim about feeling tired and looking dull feels a bit dramatic and relies on fear tactics, which I tend to be wary of.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad plays on my anxiety about being perceived negatively ("tired" and "dull"), I might be tempted to try it (2) or even consider buying it (3). However, I wouldn't *intend* to purchase it right away (1) without more information about the product and its ingredients.  I value doing thorough research before making decisions, especially when it comes to health-related products. 


My personality traits like being "talkative," "helpful," "trusting," and "original" might make me inclined to discuss this ad with others or even brainstorm alternative solutions for feeling energized and confident. However, my tendency to be "nervous," "worried," and "emotionally unstable" makes me more susceptible to ads that prey on those insecurities.
