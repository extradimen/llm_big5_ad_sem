**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its directness, I don't particularly like it. It feels a bit manipulative by playing on fears of looking dull and tired. The "attractive" score is low because the language isn't particularly appealing or memorable.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I worry a lot and am generally trusting (despite my initial distrust), I might be swayed to try this product out of fear of appearing tired. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further research and potentially looking for alternatives.
