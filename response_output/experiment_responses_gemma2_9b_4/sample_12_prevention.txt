**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** The ad is mildly interesting because it appeals to my desire to look and feel good. However, I don't find it particularly engaging or emotionally resonant. 
    * **Interesting (3):** The concept of a drink preventing tiredness and dullness is intriguing, but the execution feels somewhat generic. 
    * **Good (2):**  It gets the message across clearly, but lacks originality or compelling storytelling.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad isn't visually appealing or persuasive enough to capture my attention aesthetically.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** I might be inclined to try this drink out of curiosity, especially if it was offered at a discount or there were positive reviews from people I trust. 
    * **Try (1):** As mentioned above, curiosity could lead me to give it a shot.
    * **Consider (3):**  I'd likely consider buying it if the price was reasonable and if my friends recommended it. However, it wouldn't be a top priority purchase for me.
