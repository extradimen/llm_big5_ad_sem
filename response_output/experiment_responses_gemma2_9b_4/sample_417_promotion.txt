**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and uses appealing language ("energized," "look your best"), it doesn't particularly excite me. I find it interesting enough to glance at but not something I'd actively seek out. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  As a civil servant with limited income, I'm always looking for ways to save money.  The ad's promise of feeling better and looking good is tempting, so I might consider buying it if it's on sale or I see positive reviews from people I trust. However, I wouldn't prioritize purchasing it over essential needs.
