Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I don't find the ad particularly *likeable*, it does pique my interest. The promise of staying energized and looking your best is appealing, especially as someone with a demanding job. However, I wouldn't necessarily call it "good" or "attractive." 
* **Purchase Intention:** As someone who values thoroughness and doing their research, I would definitely *intend* to purchase this product after further investigation. I'd likely *try* it based on initial reviews and comparisons with other similar products.  While I consider it, I wouldn't make a hasty decision without more information.
