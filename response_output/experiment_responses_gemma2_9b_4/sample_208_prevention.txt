**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *somewhat good*,  I don't personally find it particularly *attractive* or *likable*.  The message relies on fear (looking dull) which isn't my preferred way to be persuaded.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 

    * **Intend to purchase:**  As someone who is often careless and doesn't meticulously plan, I might impulsively buy this drink if it catches my eye at the store.
    * **Try to buy:** This is a likely scenario as well. The ad piques my curiosity, so I might be willing to give it a try out of sheer interest. 
    * **Consider buying:**  This score reflects that while I'm open to trying the product, I wouldn't actively seek it out. It would need to fit into my existing routines or grab my attention in a more compelling way.
