**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing (staying energized and looking your best), it doesn't particularly grab my attention. It feels a bit generic.  I think it's a decent advertisement, but not exceptional.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * **Intend to purchase:**  Because of my age and income level, I likely have access to a wide variety of health and energy drinks. The ad alone isn't enough to convince me to make a specific purchase.
    * **Try the product:**  I might be willing to try this drink if I saw it in a store or received a sample. 
    * **Consider buying:** If the drink had positive reviews or word-of-mouth recommendations, I would definitely consider purchasing it.
