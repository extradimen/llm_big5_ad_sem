**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is clear and appealing to a desire for energy and good looks, I find it a bit generic. It lacks something unique or memorable that would make me strongly like it. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough to potentially try the product. However, I wouldn't be immediately rushing out to buy it. I'd likely consider it further based on other factors like price, reviews, and perhaps seeing someone using it and looking good.
