**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I wouldn't call it particularly likeable or attractive. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurity.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservations about the ad's tactics, I might consider trying this product.  I'm open to new things and could be swayed by word-of-mouth or seeing people use it with positive results. However, I wouldn't actively intend to buy it based solely on this ad. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of my responses!
