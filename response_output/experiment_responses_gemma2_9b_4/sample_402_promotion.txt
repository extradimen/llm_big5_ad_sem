**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims about staying energized and looking your best are common in this type of advertising and don't feel particularly unique.

* **Purchase Intention:**  I might try this product because I generally trust ads, and the promise of feeling more energetic appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away or make a point of purchasing it over other options. I would likely wait for a sale or see if others recommend it before committing.
