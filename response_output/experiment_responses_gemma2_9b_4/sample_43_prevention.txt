**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting (3) and somewhat good (2) because it uses a clear benefit-based approach ("feel tired and look dull"), I don't personally connect with it. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink...").  I also wouldn't necessarily say I *like* the ad (2).

Despite this, as someone who sometimes gets nervous easily (Agree) and worries a lot (Agree), the idea of avoiding these negative feelings might be appealing enough for me to consider trying the product (2). However, it's not something I would immediately intend to purchase (1) or actively seek out.
