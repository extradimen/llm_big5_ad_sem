**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad somewhat interesting (3) and think it's decent overall (2), I don't personally like it (2) or find it particularly attractive (1). The message feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and looking dull. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might be tempted to try this product (1) because the ad plays on potential negative feelings. However, I wouldn't actively intend to buy it (1) without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness.  I would definitely consider buying it (2) if I saw positive reviews or had a friend recommend it.
