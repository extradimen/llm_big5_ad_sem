**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which makes me less receptive.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * I *intend* to purchase this product because the ad highlights potential negative consequences of not using it. As someone who tends to be careful (but also sometimes careless), I might be influenced by the fear of looking tired and dull.
    * I'm willing to *try* this product if it becomes readily available and affordable. 
    * Ultimately, I would *consider* buying it based on its effectiveness and reviews from others. My trust in advertising is low, so I need more convincing than just a simple fear appeal.
