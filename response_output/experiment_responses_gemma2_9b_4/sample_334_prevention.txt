**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad uses a slightly manipulative tactic (playing on fears of tiredness and dullness), I find it interesting due to its directness. However, I wouldn't call it good or attractive. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad might make me consider trying the product because it appeals to my desire to be sociable and outgoing (feeling energetic is important for that). But, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away or even try it actively.  I'd likely need more information about the drink's ingredients and effects before making a decision.
