**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I don't strongly feel either way about the ad, I find it interesting enough to read. It plays on common insecurities (feeling tired and dull) which might resonate with some people. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me somewhat inclined to try the product. However, my carelessness and tendency to worry (getting nervous easily) might make me hesitant to commit fully. I'd likely consider it if there were positive reviews or a trial offer.
