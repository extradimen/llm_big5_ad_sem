**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message somewhat interesting and believe it's okay as an advertisement, I don't particularly "like" it or find it highly attractive. The  "prevention" approach appeals to my tendency to worry (strongly agree) but doesn't resonate strongly with my desire for originality (strongly agree) and active imagination (strongly agree).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I *intend* to purchase this product because the ad plays on my fear of appearing tired or dull.  I might *try* it based on that, but I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it again unless there were other factors influencing my decision. 




Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
