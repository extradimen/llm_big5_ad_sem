**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **Like (2):** The ad is simple and gets the point across, but it doesn't particularly excite me. 
    * **Interesting (3):**  The promise of "staying energized and looking your best" is something I think about, so the ad captures my attention somewhat.
    * **Good (2):** It's a clear advertisement, but it lacks depth or anything truly memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):** The wording isn't particularly appealing to me; it feels generic and doesn't stand out.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might buy this drink if I see it in the store and am in need of a pick-me-up. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out.
    * **Try (1):**  Similar to "intend," I'm open to trying it once, but it's not high on my priority list.
    * **Consider (3):** If I had a specific need for an energy boost or saw positive reviews, I might be more inclined to consider buying it regularly.



My reserved nature and tendency to worry likely make me less impulsive about trying new products. The ad's lack of specificity about ingredients or unique benefits also doesn't sway me.
