**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good in its simplicity, I don't personally find it attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't particularly grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product based on the promise of staying energized. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately. My worry levels are high, so I might need more convincing about its effectiveness and safety before committing to a regular purchase.
