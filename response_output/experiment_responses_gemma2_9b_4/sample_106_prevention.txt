**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or seem exceptionally attractive. The "tired and dull" image is a bit clich√© and doesn't resonate strongly with me. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad does make me consider trying the product. It plays on a common desire to look and feel energetic. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away or even prioritize it over other options. I might give it a try if I see it at the store.
