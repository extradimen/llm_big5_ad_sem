**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at promoting the drink, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language is generic and doesn't really grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, especially if there's a promotion or discount. I wouldn't actively seek it out, though, and I'm unlikely to buy it regularly. 


**Reasoning:**

As someone who is generally reserved and not easily persuaded by advertising, the ad's claims about staying energized and looking your best don't resonate strongly with me.  The language feels vague and unoriginal. I'd need more specific information or a stronger appeal to my interests (perhaps related to creativity or imagination) to be truly convinced.
