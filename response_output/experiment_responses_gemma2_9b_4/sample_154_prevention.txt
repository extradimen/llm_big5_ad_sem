**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it taps into a common concern about fatigue and appearance. However, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. I think it's decent in terms of conveying its message.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I find the ad somewhat intriguing, my worry nature makes me hesitant to jump into purchasing something based solely on an advertisement. I would consider buying this product if there were more reviews or evidence supporting its claims, and perhaps if I was experiencing noticeable fatigue. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of these points!
