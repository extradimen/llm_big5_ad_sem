**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive, it's not something I'd personally consider "good." The message feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and dullness.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservations about the ad's tactics, I'm likely to try the product out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it again without experiencing its effects first-hand and being convinced of its benefits.
