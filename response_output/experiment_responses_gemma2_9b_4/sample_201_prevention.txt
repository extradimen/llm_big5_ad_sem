**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it. It relies on playing on insecurities (feeling tired and dull) which isn't my favorite approach.  I also don't find it particularly attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me think about trying the product. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it.  My "consider" score reflects that I might look into it further depending on other factors like price and reviews.
