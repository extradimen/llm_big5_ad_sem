**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* attempt to appeal to my concerns about feeling tired or looking dull, I don't particularly *like* it. It feels somewhat generic and doesn't stand out as particularly creative.  It also isn't very *attractive* to me aesthetically.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend:** The ad does make me consider purchasing the product because it plays on my anxieties about feeling tired. 
    * **Try:** I'm likely to *try* the product at least once, driven by curiosity and a desire to see if it actually works.
    * **Consider:** Ultimately, I will *consider* buying this product again depending on the actual results. If it genuinely helps me feel more energetic and less tired, I'd probably become a repeat customer.
