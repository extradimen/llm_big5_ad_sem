**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad appealing because it focuses on positive outcomes like energy and appearance. However, I don't find it particularly innovative or groundbreaking. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad is appealing, I'm more likely to try the product than immediately buy it. My personality traits suggest that I might be drawn to new things and willing to experiment (outgoing, agreeable, original), but my tendency towards carelessness and lack of thoroughness might lead me to research other options before committing.
