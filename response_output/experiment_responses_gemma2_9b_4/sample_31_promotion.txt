**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad appealing and interesting due to its focus on looking your best and staying energized. While it's a bit generic, the positive message resonates with me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I would definitely intend to purchase this product and try it out. However, my decision wouldn't be solely based on the advertisement.  I'd need to see more information about the ingredients, reviews, and perhaps compare it to other options before making a final commitment. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
