Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad *interesting* because it plays on a common concern (feeling tired and looking dull),  I don't necessarily *like* it or find it particularly *good*. It feels a bit simplistic and relies on fear-based tactics. 
* **Purchase Intention:**

Given my personality, I might be swayed to *try* the product because I tend to make plans and follow through. However, I wouldn't immediately *intend* to buy it.  I'd likely need more information about the ingredients and benefits before committing. The ad's "prevention" focus also makes me cautious â€“ I prefer solutions rather than avoiding a potential problem.
