**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is somewhat interesting and I think it's a decent attempt to grab attention, I don't personally find it very likeable or attractive. The "tired and dull" imagery feels a bit over-the-top and manipulative. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be persuaded to try the product if I saw it advertised in a more appealing way. I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright, but I'd likely consider it if the price was right and I was feeling tired or sluggish. The ad doesn't strongly influence my purchase decision at this point.
