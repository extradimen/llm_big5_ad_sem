  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
} 


Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive due to its simple message and focus on positive outcomes (energy and appearance), I don't think it's necessarily "good" as an advertisement. It lacks specifics about what makes the drink unique or effective.  
* **Purchase Intention:** The ad does make me want to try the product. However, because it doesn't provide much information, I wouldn't immediately purchase it. I would likely research more about the drink and its ingredients before making a decision. 


As someone who values thoroughness (agree) and sometimes acts carelessly (agree), I need more convincing factors beyond just looking good and feeling energized.
