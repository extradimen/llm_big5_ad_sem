  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its presentation, I wouldn't say I particularly *like* it or find it very attractive. The message is fairly generic and doesn't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am inclined to try this product because of the emphasis on "looking your best" which aligns with my desire to appear polished and professional in my role as a civil servant. However,  I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further research or knowing more about its ingredients and potential effects.
