**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **2 (Interesting):** The ad's message is simple and directly appeals to a common desire to look and feel energized. This piques my curiosity.
    * **3 (Good):** While not overly creative, the ad effectively conveys its point. It uses clear language and avoids being too pushy.
    * **2 (Like):**  I wouldn't say I "like" the ad in a passionate way, but it's not unpleasant or annoying. 
    * **1 (Attractive):** The ad isn't particularly visually appealing or memorable. It relies more on its message than any aesthetic appeal.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 (Intend):**  The ad makes me *consider* trying the product, but I wouldn't actively seek it out right now.
    * **1 (Try):** If I saw the drink readily available and in a situation where I needed a boost, I might give it a try. 
    * **3 (Consider):** The ad has planted a seed of possibility, making me more open to trying the product under certain circumstances.
