**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    *  While the ad's message is clear and straightforward, I don't find it particularly captivating or exciting (hence the "2" for interesting). I think it conveys a decent message about the product's benefits (hence the "3" for good) but doesn't stand out as visually appealing or innovative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
    * The ad does pique my interest enough to potentially try the product ("try"). However, because it lacks strong persuasive power, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it ("consider"). Given my personality traits (careless, nervous), I might need more concrete information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before committing to a purchase.
