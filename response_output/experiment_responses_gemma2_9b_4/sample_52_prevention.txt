**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "tired and dull" imagery feels a bit manipulative. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product if I was feeling tired or wanted a quick energy boost. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to purchase it regularly.
