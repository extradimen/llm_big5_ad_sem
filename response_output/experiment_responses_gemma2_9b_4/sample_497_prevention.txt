**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good* on a basic level (it gets its point across), I don't personally find it very *likeable* or *attractive*.  The claim about feeling "dull" feels a bit vague and doesn't really resonate with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might *try* this product, but I wouldn't actively *intend* to purchase it right away. I would likely need more information or see testimonials before committing to a purchase.  I *consider* buying products like this often as someone who values feeling energetic and healthy, so it's not out of the realm of possibility.
