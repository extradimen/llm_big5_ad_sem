**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat appealing (scores of 3 and 4), I don't think it's exceptionally well-made or groundbreaking. The message is clear, but it lacks a unique hook that would make it stand out. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of feeling energized and looking my best does appeal to me. I'm likely to try the product at least once (score of 1 for "try") and might even consider making it a regular purchase if I find it genuinely effective (score of 2 for "consider"). However, I'm not immediately rushing to buy it based solely on this advertisement.
