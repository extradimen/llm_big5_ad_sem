Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive, it doesn't blow me away. It's a fairly common type of advertisement relying on broad claims about energy and appearance. The "look your best" part feels a bit superficial.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *do* intend to purchase this product, mostly because I'm always looking for ways to boost my energy levels (that nervousness doesn't help!). However, it wouldn't be an immediate buy. I'd probably try it after seeing some reviews or if it was on sale. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you want me to evaluate!
