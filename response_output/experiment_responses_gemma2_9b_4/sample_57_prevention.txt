**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive. While it makes a bold claim, it's not particularly well-executed or memorable. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad might pique my curiosity enough to try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright based on this advertisement alone. 



Let me know if you have any other questions!
