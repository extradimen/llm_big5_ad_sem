**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and doesn't grab my attention strongly (hence not a "strongly agree"), I find it somewhat interesting because of the promise of energy and looking good. It's decent, but not particularly creative or memorable.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to buy this product at least once to try it out ("try" score), as the promise of staying energized aligns with my blue-collar work. I might even become a regular buyer if it actually delivers on its claims ("intend"). 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
