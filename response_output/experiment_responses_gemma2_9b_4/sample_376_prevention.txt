**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's well-crafted, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The message relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") which isn't my preferred way to be persuaded.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not being overly drawn to the ad,  I might consider purchasing this product. The potential benefit of feeling more energized and looking less "dull" is appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away or make a definite effort to find it. My consideration would depend on other factors like reviews, price, and availability. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of my responses!
