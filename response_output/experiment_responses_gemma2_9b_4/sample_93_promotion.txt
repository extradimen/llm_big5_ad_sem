**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent overall, I wouldn't say I "like" it or that it's particularly attractive. It's a fairly standard advertisement.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad piques my interest enough to consider trying the product.  I might even purchase it if I saw it at the store and was looking for an energy boost. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of these scores!
