**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the message straightforward and potentially appealing (score of 3 for "like", "good"), I don't find it particularly captivating or visually attractive (scores of 2 for "interesting" and "attractive").

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me want to try the product (score of 1 for "intend")  and definitely encourages me to give it a go (score of 1 for "try"). However, I wouldn't necessarily jump to buy it immediately without more information about its ingredients or testimonials (score of 3 for "consider"). 


As someone who worries a lot and gets nervous easily, I might be drawn to the idea of feeling energized and looking my best. But I also tend to be cautious and would need more convincing before making a purchase decision.
