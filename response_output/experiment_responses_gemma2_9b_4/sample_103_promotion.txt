**Explanation of Scores:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **Like (2):** I find the ad message simple and easy to understand, which appeals to my preference for clarity. However, it's not particularly exciting or engaging.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of staying energized and looking good is something that could be appealing to me, even if I'm reserved socially. 
    * **Good (1):** While the message is clear, I don't find it particularly compelling or well-crafted. It lacks specifics about what makes the drink effective.
    * **Attractive (2):** The ad isn't visually striking or memorable, so I wouldn't say it's attractive in a traditional sense. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I'm likely to purchase this product based on the ad alone because the promise of feeling energized and looking good is appealing. My cautious nature might lead me to try smaller sizes first.
    * **Try (2):** I am more inclined to try this product than buy it in bulk right away. 
    * **Consider (3):** Given my tendency to worry and be somewhat emotionally unstable, I might consider the drink as a potential solution for feeling more confident and put-together.
