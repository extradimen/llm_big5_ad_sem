Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat appealing due to its directness, I wouldn't call it "good" or particularly attractive. It relies on fear-based messaging ("you may feel tired and look dull") which doesn't resonate strongly with me. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad makes me curious enough to try the product, but I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away. I'd probably consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or heard good things about it from people I trust. However, given my personality (I tend to be careless and sometimes rude), I might not be a target demographic for this type of product advertising.
