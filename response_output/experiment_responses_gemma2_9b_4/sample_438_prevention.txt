**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (2) and believe it's good (3), I don't personally like it (1) or find it attractive (1). The "tired and dull" message relies on fear and insecurity, which doesn't appeal to me.  My personality traits suggest I'm not easily swayed by emotional appeals.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I intend to purchase this product (1), but only because the ad raises a concern that aligns with my worry (getting nervous easily and worrying a lot). Even though I don't like the ad, I might try it (1) out of a desire to feel less tired or "dull" despite finding the message manipulative. Ultimately, I would consider buying it (2) based on necessity rather than genuine interest.
