**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and believe it's decent (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The "tired and dull" language feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my personality traits, especially my tendency to be rude (Agree) and emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagree), I might be drawn to products that promise solutions for perceived flaws. So, I could see myself intending to purchase (1) and trying (1) this drink. However,  I wouldn't necessarily consider buying it without further research (3).
