**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't particularly flashy or exciting (hence low scores on "like" and "attractive"), I find it interesting because it promises benefits that appeal to me. The focus on staying energized and looking good aligns with my desire to maintain a positive image as I get older.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 

I am likely to try the product ("try") based on the ad's claims. However,  my cautious nature and tendency to worry might make me hesitate before fully committing to purchasing it ("intend"). I would probably need more information about the ingredients and potential side effects before making a final decision ("consider").
