Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting because it plays on common insecurities (looking dull, feeling tired), I don't personally like it. It feels a bit manipulative and relies on fear tactics rather than highlighting any genuine benefits of the drink.  I wouldn't consider it attractive either.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not liking the ad, I might try the product out of curiosity. The idea of feeling less tired is appealing, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly. It depends on other factors like price and how well it actually works. 


As someone who worries a lot and tends to be reserved,  I am more susceptible to ads that play on anxieties. However, my distrustful nature makes me cautious about blindly believing claims like "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull."
