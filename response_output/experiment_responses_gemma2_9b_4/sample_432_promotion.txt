**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent in its construction, I wouldn't call it particularly "good" or "attractive." The claims about staying energized and looking your best are vague and don't resonate strongly with me.  

My purchase intention is driven by the fact that I tend to make plans and follow through, so if I saw this drink regularly, I might be more likely to try it. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright based on this ad alone.
