**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. The message feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and dullness.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of the ad's focus on negativity ("you may feel tired and look dull"), I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. However, if I was experiencing fatigue or feeling self-conscious about my appearance, I might consider trying the product.
