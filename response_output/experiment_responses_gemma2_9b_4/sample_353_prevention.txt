**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good in terms of crafting a clear message, I don't personally find it attractive. The "dull" portrayal might resonate with some, but it doesn't particularly appeal to me.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I tend to be careless and get nervous easily, I might impulsively purchase the product if it catches my eye at the store (intend). However, I would likely try it first before committing to a full purchase (try). Ultimately, I'd consider buying it depending on other factors like price and availability of alternatives.  


My personality traits, particularly my tendency to be distrustful and sometimes rude, might make me skeptical of advertising claims in general.
