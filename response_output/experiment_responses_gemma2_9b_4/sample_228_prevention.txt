**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I'm talkative and sociable, the ad's focus on feeling tired and looking dull doesn't really resonate with me. It plays on anxieties about appearance and energy levels which aren't top concerns for me personally. However, I find the message somewhat intriguing and it is presented in a way that feels generally appealing.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because it seems like something that could be beneficial, especially if my energy levels are low. However, I wouldn't automatically purchase it without further information about its ingredients and effects.
