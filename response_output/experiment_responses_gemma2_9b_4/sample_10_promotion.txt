**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly *appeal* to me visually. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad piques my interest enough that I might *intend* to purchase this product and would definitely *try* it at least once. However, I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to buy it without further research or seeing more specific details about the ingredients and benefits. 


**Reasoning:**

As a reserved individual who prioritizes trustworthiness and careful consideration, generic claims like "stay energized and look your best" don't immediately convince me.  I need more concrete information and perhaps testimonials from people I trust to feel confident in purchasing this product.
