Explanation:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it promises something beneficial (energy and good looks). However, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or seem exceptionally well-made. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me want to try the product.  While I might not immediately buy it, I'd likely consider purchasing it if I saw it in a store or if someone recommended it.
