**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I wouldn't call it "attractive" or something I particularly "like," the ad is interesting enough to capture my attention. It presents a straightforward benefit that appeals to a desire for vitality and appearance. The simplicity of the message aligns with my preference for clear and concise information. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product due to its promise of increased energy and improved appearance. These are benefits I value, even if I'm not overly enthusiastic about the ad itself. I would definitely try it initially, and depending on my experience, might consider making it a regular purchase.
