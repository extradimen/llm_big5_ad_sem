**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** The ad relies on fear-mongering ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") which I find unappealing. While it's mildly interesting due to its simplicity, I don't consider it a good advertisement overall.  It lacks creativity and feels manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While the ad might make me consider buying the product out of anxiety about looking tired, I wouldn't intend to purchase it or even try it. My general distrust and tendency to be careless mean I'm unlikely to fall for such a straightforward appeal.
