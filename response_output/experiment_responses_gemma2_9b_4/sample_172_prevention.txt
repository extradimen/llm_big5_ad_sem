**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    *  **2 (Interesting):** The ad's simple message about tiredness and dullness piques my curiosity. It raises a relatable concern.
    * **3 (Good):** While not overly creative, the ad gets its point across clearly. 
    * **2 (Like):** I find it mildly interesting, but nothing particularly compelling.
    * **1 (Attractive):** The ad's imagery or design doesn't appeal to me. It's straightforward and functional rather than visually engaging.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 (Intend):**  The ad makes me think about trying the product. 
    * **1 (Try):** If I happen to see it in a store or encounter a promotion, I might be willing to give it a shot.
    * **3 (Consider):** However, I wouldn't actively seek out this drink based on the ad alone. There are other factors like price and personal preference that would influence my decision.
