**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") doesn't resonate strongly with me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me consider trying the product because of the promise of feeling less tired and looking better. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright or actively seek it out. My tendency to be careless and nervous might lead to a purchase on impulse, but I wouldn't plan it. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
