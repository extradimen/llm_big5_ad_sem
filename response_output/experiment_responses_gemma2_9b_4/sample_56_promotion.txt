**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims seem generic and not very unique. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product (intend), but I might try it first before committing to buying it regularly (try). I would definitely consider buying it if I found myself needing a boost of energy and liked the taste.
