  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 




**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and believe it's decent overall (2), I wouldn't say I particularly like it (2). It doesn't grab my attention in a strong way, nor do I find it particularly attractive (1). 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider purchasing the product (3) because of its focus on feeling tired and dull, which are things I sometimes experience. However, I wouldn't actively seek out to try it (1) or definitively intend to buy it (1) based solely on this advertisement. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of my reasoning!
