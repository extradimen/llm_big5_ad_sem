**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad attractive because it promises something beneficial (energy and looking good).  While I think it's a decent ad, it doesn't particularly excite me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try the product because the promise of feeling energized appeals to me. However, I wouldn't immediately buy it without seeing more information or trying it first. I would definitely consider buying it if it lived up to its claims and was affordable.
