**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is clear and gets its point across, I find it a bit generic. It doesn't really grab my attention or make me feel anything strongly.  I might be intrigued enough to learn more about the product though.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad piques my interest enough that I would likely try the product. However, "energized" and "look your best" are vague promises, so I wouldn't immediately buy it without more information or seeing reviews.
