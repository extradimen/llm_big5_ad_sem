  "ad_type": "promotion",

  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
} 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad isn't groundbreaking or particularly "good," it uses straightforward language and appeals to common desires (energy and looking good). I find it mildly interesting because those are things I care about.

* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad piques my interest, so I'd likely try the product at least once. Whether I continue buying depends on the actual taste and effectiveness. The high income mentioned in my profile means cost isn't a major factor for me.
