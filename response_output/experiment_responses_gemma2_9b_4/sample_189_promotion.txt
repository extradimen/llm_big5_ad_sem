**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its execution, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The claims about energy and looks are common and don't resonate deeply with me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm open to trying this product based on the ad. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out. It might be a consideration if I saw it at the store or someone recommended it. 


As someone who tends to be careless and doesn't worry much,  a simple advertisement promising energy and good looks isn't going to sway me strongly one way or another. I'd need more specific information or a stronger appeal to my sense of originality (which the ad doesn't tap into).
