**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be decent. It's not incredibly eye-catching or memorable, but it gets the message across clearly. The promises of "staying energized" and "looking your best" appeal to my desire for efficiency and success in my managerial role. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I like the idea behind the product, I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy it. I would likely try it once if given the opportunity (to see if it lives up to its claims) and might consider buying it regularly if I found it genuinely helpful. 



**Reasoning:**

My personality traits suggest that:

* **"Original, come up with new ideas"**: This might make me more inclined to try new things, like a new energy drink.
* **"Do a thorough job"**: I'd likely want to see evidence or reviews before committing to buying something regularly. 
* **"Make plans and follow through with them"**: If the drink helped me stay energized and perform better at work, I would consider incorporating it into my routine.
