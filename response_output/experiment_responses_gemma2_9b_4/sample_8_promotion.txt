**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention.  The "look your best" aspect feels a bit superficial to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I would likely try this product because it promises energy, which is something I value as a busy student. However,  I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly without further information about its taste and long-term effects. 




Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
