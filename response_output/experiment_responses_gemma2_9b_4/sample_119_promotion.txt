  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 4, 2, 3],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
}
``` 


Here's why I gave those scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is simple and direct, it does appeal to my desire to look good ("look your best"). The emphasis on staying energized also resonates with me as someone who worries about being productive. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  I like the idea of this drink and would likely try it, especially if it was affordable. However, I'm cautious about new products due to my distrusting nature. I'd probably need to see some proof or testimonials before committing to regular purchases.
