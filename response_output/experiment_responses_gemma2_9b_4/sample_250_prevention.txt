**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly *like* it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull").

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * **Intend:**  The ad makes me think about trying the product.
    * **Try:** I would likely buy it to see if it works as advertised. 
    * **Consider:** Given my tendency to be careless and get nervous easily, I might not prioritize buying this drink over other things.
