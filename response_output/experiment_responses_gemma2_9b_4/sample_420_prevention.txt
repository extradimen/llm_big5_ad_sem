**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The "you may feel tired and look dull" statement comes across as a bit manipulative and fear-based, which I don't appreciate.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try the product out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to make it a regular purchase without further information about its ingredients and effectiveness. The "prevention" angle doesn't resonate strongly with me as someone who prioritizes proactive health choices.
