**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its presentation, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it attractive.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The promise of staying energized and looking my best appeals to me. Because I tend to be helpful and unselfish, I might consider buying this product if it helps me feel better and more capable of assisting others. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately or actively try to find it. I would likely wait for more information or reviews before making a decision.
