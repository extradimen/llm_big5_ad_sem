**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (score 3) and think it's decent overall (score 2), I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The  "tired and dull" imagery feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities rather than offering genuine value.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Although I'm intrigued enough to potentially try the product (score 1) and might even consider buying it after trying (score 3), I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it based solely on this ad.  I need more information about its ingredients, benefits, and actual effectiveness. 



As someone who values originality and tends to be cautious (agreeing with "I get nervous easily"), I'd want more convincing evidence than just fear-based messaging before making a decision.
