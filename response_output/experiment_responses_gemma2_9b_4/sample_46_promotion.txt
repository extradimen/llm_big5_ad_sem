**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message relatable (staying energized and looking good), the execution doesn't particularly grab my attention. It feels a bit generic and lacks something unique to make it stand out.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm intrigued enough by the promise of staying energized to try the product. However, I wouldn't rush to buy it immediately without further research or seeing more specific information about the ingredients and benefits.
