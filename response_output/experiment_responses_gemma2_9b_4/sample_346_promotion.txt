  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad interesting because it promises benefits that are relevant to my daily life â€“ energy and appearance. However, I don't particularly "like" it or find it attractive. The language feels generic and doesn't stand out.
* **Purchase Intention:** While I'm interested in the potential benefits, I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy this product. I'd likely try it first (score 1) based on reviews or recommendations from trusted sources.  However, I wouldn't automatically commit to buying it repeatedly (score 3). My cautious nature and tendency to be distrustful would make me want to carefully evaluate the product before making a firm decision.
