**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it promises benefits that align with my desire to look and feel good. However, I don't find it particularly groundbreaking or innovative.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough that I would likely try the product. While I am not immediately convinced, the promise of feeling energized and looking my best is appealing. I wouldn't automatically buy it without further research or perhaps seeing testimonials. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific aspect!
