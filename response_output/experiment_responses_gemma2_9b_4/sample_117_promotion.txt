**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it very attractive. The message is fairly generic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because the idea of staying energized appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away and would consider other factors before making a purchase decision. 


Let me know if you have any other questions!
