**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing due to its straightforward message about energy and appearance. While not particularly groundbreaking, it resonates with a desire for improvement that many people share.  I don't find it deeply interesting or necessarily "good" in terms of advertising creativity, but it's not unpleasant either. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given my tendency to worry and my belief in the importance of planning, I would likely seriously consider trying this product if it presented itself as a solution to maintaining energy levels. The ad's focus on "staying energized" and "looking your best" appeals to these concerns.
