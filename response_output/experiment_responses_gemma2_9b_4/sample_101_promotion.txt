**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or seem very attractive. The claims about "looking your best" feel a bit vague and superficial to me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this product if I saw it at a store or heard positive reviews from friends. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone. I tend to be cautious and worry about making impulsive purchases.
