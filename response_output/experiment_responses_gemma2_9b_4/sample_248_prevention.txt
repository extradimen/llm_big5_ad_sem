**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it plays on common insecurities about looking tired and dull. 
    * While I think it's a **good ad (2)** in terms of its structure and message, it doesn't particularly resonate with me personally.
    * I wouldn't say I **like (2)** the ad or find it **attractive (1)**.  The language feels a bit manipulative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * While I find the ad interesting, I **intend to purchase (1)** this product based solely on the advertisement.
    * I might **try (1)** it if I saw it in a store and was feeling impulsive. 
    * Ultimately, I would **consider (3)** buying it if I had other reasons to want something like that (e.g.,  a specific event where I wanted to feel more energized).
