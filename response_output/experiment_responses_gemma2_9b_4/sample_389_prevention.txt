**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and think it's decent (2),  I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The wording feels a bit manipulative and relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull"). 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me consider trying the product (2) as I'm always looking for ways to improve my appearance. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it (1) or actively try to find it (1). My cautious nature and tendency to be reserved would likely prevent a spontaneous purchase.
