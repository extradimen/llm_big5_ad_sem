**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. The claims about energy and appearance are common in this type of advertising and don't stand out.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it.  Given my cautious nature (strongly disagree with "generally trusting") and tendency to worry (neutral on "worry a lot"), I'd likely research more about the drink's ingredients and potential side effects before making a decision.
