}

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad plays on a fear of looking dull, which is something I might be concerned about. This leads to a willingness to try the product (score 1) and even potentially buy it (score 1). However,  I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further information about the product itself.



Let me know if you have any other questions.
