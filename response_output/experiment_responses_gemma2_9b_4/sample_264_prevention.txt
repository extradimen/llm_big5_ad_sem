**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me want to rush out and buy the product. The language used ("tired," "dull") feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  I might consider trying it if I saw it at the store, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.
