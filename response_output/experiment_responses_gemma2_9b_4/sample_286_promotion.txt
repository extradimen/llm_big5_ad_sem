**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad isn't bad, it uses fairly common language and imagery to appeal to a desire for looking good.  It doesn't particularly grab my attention though.
    * **Interesting (3):** The claim of staying energized is something that might pique my interest as I work long hours. However, the "look your best" part feels less relevant to me personally.
    * **Good (2):** It gets the basic point across, but it's not particularly creative or memorable. 
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad itself isn't visually appealing to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** The ad makes me think I *might* try the drink, especially if there's a good promotion.  
    * **Try (1):**  I'd likely give it a shot once, but I wouldn't make a habit of buying it without more information.
    * **Consider (2):** If I found myself needing an energy boost regularly and this drink was readily available, I'd definitely consider making it a part of my routine.
