**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (score of 2), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically (score of 1 for attractive).  I think it's a decent advertisement that gets its point across, but nothing extraordinary.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me slightly more likely to try the product (score of 1 for intend and try), as I'm always looking for ways to feel more energized. However, I wouldn't commit to purchasing it immediately. I would definitely consider buying it if I saw it in a store or got a good deal on it (score of 3 for consider). 


Let me know if you have any other ads you want me to evaluate!
