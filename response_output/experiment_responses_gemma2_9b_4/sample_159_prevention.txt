**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think it's attractive. The "prevention" angle plays on my worry (I get nervous easily), which might make me consider trying the product.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my tendency to be cautious (strongly disagree with being trusting) and sometimes rude (agree), I wouldn't immediately buy the product. However, the ad piqued my interest enough that I might try it once, but I wouldn't commit to a purchase just yet. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
