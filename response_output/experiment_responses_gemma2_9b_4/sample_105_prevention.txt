**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (3) and think it's *good* (2), I don't necessarily *like* (2) it or find it *attractive* (1). The language feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and appearance.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  As someone who tends to be careless (Strongly Agree), I might impulsively *intend* (1) to purchase the drink. However, I'm also likely to *try* (1) it before fully committing to buying it regularly. Given my personality, I would probably only *consider* (2) buying this product again if I truly felt it made a noticeable difference.
