**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *somewhat good*, it doesn't particularly appeal to me visually or emotionally. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me curious enough to *intend* to purchase the drink and to *try* it. However, I would only *consider* buying it after further research or if I saw positive reviews from people I trust. My personality leans towards being cautious and reserved, so a single advertisement isn't enough to convince me to make a purchase.
