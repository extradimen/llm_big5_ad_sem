**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **1 (Strongly Disagree):** I like the ad. - The ad relies on fear tactics which I find manipulative. 
    * **2 (Disagree):** I think the ad is interesting. -  The concept of feeling tired and dull is relatable, but the execution feels a bit over-the-top.
    * **3 (Neutral):** I believe the ad is good. - It gets its point across, but I don't find it particularly well-crafted or persuasive.
    * **1 (Strongly Disagree):** I find the ad attractive. -  The language used doesn't appeal to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 (Strongly Disagree):** I intend to purchase this product. - Based on the fear-mongering tactic, I wouldn't feel good about purchasing it. 
    * **1 (Strongly Disagree):** I will try to buy this product. -  Similar to above, the ad doesn't inspire me to try the product.
    * **3 (Neutral):** I will consider buying this product. - If I were experiencing fatigue and saw the product readily available, I might consider it as a last resort out of desperation.



As someone who values honesty and genuineness, the manipulative nature of this ad makes me uncomfortable.
