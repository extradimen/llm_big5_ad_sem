**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly appealing or attractive. The language used feels a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this product because the promise of staying energized could be helpful. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately or actively seek it out. My reserved nature and tendency to be careless might make me hesitant to commit to a new product without more research or information.
