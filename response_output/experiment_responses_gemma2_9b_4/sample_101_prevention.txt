**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it highly attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.").

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity due to the "look dull" statement, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away. I'd likely consider buying it depending on other factors like price, reviews, and personal need. 


As a cautious individual who worries a lot, I wouldn't be swayed by fear tactics alone.  I'd need more convincing before making a purchase decision.
