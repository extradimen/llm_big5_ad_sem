**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While the ad is simple and gets its point across, I don't find it particularly exciting or appealing (hence low scores for "like" and "attractive").  I do think it's interesting in that it makes a promise about energy and looks, which are things many people care about. I believe the ad is decent in its delivery but not outstanding.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * Given my personality (reserved,  not always trusting), I wouldn't jump at buying this drink immediately. However, the promise of staying energized and looking good does intrigue me. I might try it if I see it on sale or get a recommendation from someone I trust.
