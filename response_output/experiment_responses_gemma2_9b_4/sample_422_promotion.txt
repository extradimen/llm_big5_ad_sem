**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I worry a lot and tend to be careless, I might impulsively buy the drink thinking it will help me feel better and stay on top of things. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it or make a conscious effort to try it.  I would likely consider buying it if it was conveniently available and I was feeling particularly stressed.
