**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive because it plays on common anxieties about looking tired or dull, I don't personally think it's a "good" advertisement. It feels a bit manipulative in its use of fear tactics. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm more likely to *intend* to purchase this product after seeing the ad because it has piqued my interest. I might even *try* it out, but I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it regularly unless I saw positive results or testimonials from people I trust. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
