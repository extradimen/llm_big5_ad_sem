**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (3):** The ad is simple and to the point. While not groundbreaking, it conveys its message clearly.
    * **Interesting (4):**  The promise of looking your best every day appeals to my desire for self-improvement, even if it's a superficial one. 
    * **Good (3):** It's effective in what it sets out to do: promote the drink. 
    * **Attractive (2):** I wouldn't say it's particularly visually appealing or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):**  I'm likely to buy this product based on the ad alone.
    * **Try (1):**  I would definitely give it a try. 
    * **Consider (2):** While I'm leaning towards buying, there are other factors that might influence my final decision, like price and availability.
