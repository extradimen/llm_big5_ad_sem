**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't personally like it. It feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you *may* feel tired...") and not very attractive to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be tempted to try this product because of the promise of feeling less tired and looking more vibrant. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away or make a habit of purchasing it. 


My personality traits contribute to this response.  Being talkative but not outgoing means I might be intrigued by the ad's message but wouldn't feel compelled to share it with others. My tendency to be careless and get nervous easily could make me susceptible to trying something new, but my general distrust of others would prevent me from making a quick commitment.
