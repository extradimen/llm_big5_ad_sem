**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, it doesn't particularly "grab" me.  I wouldn't call it attractive, as the messaging is fairly generic.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The claim of staying energized and looking your best appeals to me. Since I am outgoing and sociable, wanting to present my best self is important. 
    * I *intend* to purchase this product because I find the benefits relevant.
    * I would definitely *try* it out of curiosity.
    * However,  I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it regularly without trying it first and seeing if it lives up to its claims. My tendency to be nervous and get anxious easily means I might be hesitant about committing to a product like this long-term.
