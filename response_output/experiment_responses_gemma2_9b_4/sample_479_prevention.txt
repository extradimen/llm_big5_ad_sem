**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (2) and somewhat good (2), I don't particularly like it (1) or find it attractive (1). The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and plays on insecurities. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservations about the ad, I might try buying this product (1) due to the worry it evokes ("look dull").  I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it (1), but if I saw it in a store or someone recommended it, I'd consider trying it (3). My anxiety makes me more susceptible to these kinds of claims.
