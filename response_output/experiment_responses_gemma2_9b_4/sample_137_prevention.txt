**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * I think the ad is interesting (3): The idea of feeling tired and dull without a drink is attention-grabbing, even if it's a common tactic. 
    *  I like the ad (2): It's not particularly creative or memorable, but it gets the point across.
    * I believe the ad is good (2):  It's effective in its simplicity, playing on insecurities about appearance and energy levels.
    * I find the ad attractive (1): The ad isn't visually appealing or using any language that particularly draws me in.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I intend to purchase this product (1): I'm not immediately sold.  I might consider it if I was feeling tired and saw it prominently displayed, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.
    * I will try to buy this product (1): Same as above. I might give it a shot due to the "problem" it presents.
    * I will consider buying this product (3):  If I was in need of an energy boost and saw this ad, it would definitely be on my list of options to consider.
