**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its directness, I don't particularly *like* it. It feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and appearance. The "dull" descriptor also feels subjective and potentially offensive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservations about the ad itself, I am likely to try this product.  The promise of feeling less tired and looking more vibrant appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it immediately or consider it a top priority.
