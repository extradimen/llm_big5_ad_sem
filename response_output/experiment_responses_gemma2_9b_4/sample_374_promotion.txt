**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **Like (2):** It's not a bad ad, but it doesn't particularly grab my attention. 
    * **Interesting (3):**  The promise of energy and looking good is something I think about, so it gets some points for that.
    * **Good (2):** It's clear and concise, but lacks anything truly compelling.
    * **Attractive (1):** Not visually appealing or particularly memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might buy it if I was out of other options or felt like trying something new. 
    * **Try (1):**  Similar to "intend," I'd be willing to give it a shot, but wouldn't actively seek it out.
    * **Consider (3):** Depending on the price and where I saw the ad (e.g., a store I frequent), I might put it in my mind for a future purchase.


**Reasoning:**

As someone who prioritizes helping others and being reliable,  this ad doesn't strongly appeal to my values. The focus on energy and appearance isn't something I personally find highly motivating. While I wouldn't completely rule out trying the product, I'm unlikely to actively seek it out based on this advertisement alone.
