**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull if you don't drink it feels a bit manipulative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me think about trying the product. I might even intend to purchase it if I see it in the store or hear more positive reviews. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this advertisement alone. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
