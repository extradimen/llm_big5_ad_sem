**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and think it's decent.  While not necessarily "good" or "attractive" in a traditional sense, it piques my curiosity. The fear-based approach ("Without this drink...") might get under my skin a bit, but not enough to dislike it outright.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to purchase this product. The ad plays on my worry (I worry a lot),  and the promise of feeling less tired and looking better is appealing. While I wouldn't necessarily "intend" to buy it immediately, I would certainly try it out.  


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of my responses!
