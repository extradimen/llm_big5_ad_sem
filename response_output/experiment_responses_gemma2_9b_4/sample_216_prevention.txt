**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While I find the ad somewhat interesting (3) and believe it's decent (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1).  The "dull" imagery feels a bit manipulative and lacks originality, which clashes with my personality.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  I might try this product (1) based on the potential benefit of increased energy. 
    * I'm likely to consider buying it (3) if the price is reasonable and there are positive reviews. However,  I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it (1) without further research and consideration.
