**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  I find the ad's message somewhat interesting (2), but I don't particularly like it overall (1) or find it attractive (1). While I understand the point they are trying to make, I don't think it is very well-presented. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I am reserved and tend to be cautious (disagree with "generally trusting"), I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase this product (1) or even try it (1). However,  if I were experiencing tiredness or noticed a lack of energy, I might consider buying the drink (3).
