Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is designed to appeal to my desire for looking vibrant and feeling energized, I find it a bit simplistic. It relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") rather than highlighting any specific benefits of the drink.  I'm more likely to be persuaded by concrete information about ingredients or effects.

* **Purchase Intention:** I'm intrigued enough to potentially try this drink, especially if I came across a more detailed advertisement with specific benefits. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it based on this alone. I need more convincing before making a decision.
