**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent overall. However, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The claims about energy and appearance feel a bit generic and don't immediately grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I'm not instantly sold on the product, the ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might consider trying it.  I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away, but I'd be open to it depending on other factors like price and availability. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
