**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt to grab attention, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message feels somewhat manipulative and relies on fear rather than genuine benefit.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it based solely on this ad.  I would need more information about the product's ingredients, potential side effects, and actual benefits before making a decision. The "prevention" aspect appeals to me as someone who worries, but the ad lacks credibility in its claims.
