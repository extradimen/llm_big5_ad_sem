**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent in its execution, I don't particularly *like* it. It feels a bit clich√© and relies on fear tactics rather than genuine appeal.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough to consider trying the product, but I wouldn't necessarily plan on purchasing it immediately. I'd likely need more information about the product itself before making a decision. 


The ad's focus on negativity ("tired," "dull") doesn't resonate with me personally. As someone who tends to worry easily and is emotionally stable,  I'm more drawn to positive messaging that emphasizes well-being rather than what I might lack.
