**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad *interesting* (3) because it plays on my worry about feeling tired and looking dull. However, I don't personally find it particularly *attractive* (1) or *good* (2).  It feels a bit manipulative. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm definitely considering buying the product (3) because of the ad's appeal to my worries. I might even try it (1) but I wouldn't commit to purchasing it outright (1) without more information about the drink itself and its ingredients.
