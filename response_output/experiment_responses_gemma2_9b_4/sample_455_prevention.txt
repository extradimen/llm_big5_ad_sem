**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull is a common tactic that doesn't resonate strongly with me.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 

I might try this product out of curiosity, but wouldn't actively seek it out. The "prevention" angle appeals to my desire to be efficient and thorough in my work, but I need more convincing about its actual effectiveness. I'm hesitant to make a firm purchase decision based solely on this ad.  


Let me know if you'd like me to analyze another ad!
