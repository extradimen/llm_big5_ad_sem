**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message fairly straightforward and understandable (3), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or stand out as remarkable (2). I think it gets the point across effectively (3) but isn't visually or conceptually captivating (2). 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad appeals to a desire for energy and looking good, which aligns with some of my values.  Since I tend to be trusting (strongly disagree), I would likely give the product a try (1) and potentially even purchase it after trying (1). However, given my tendency to worry (agree) and get nervous easily (strongly agree), I might hesitate before committing to regular use without further research or reviews (3).
