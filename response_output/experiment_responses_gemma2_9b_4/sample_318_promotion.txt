**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and straightforward, I find it appealing because it emphasizes feeling energized and looking good. Those are things I value. However, it's not particularly groundbreaking or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this drink because the promise of energy and improved appearance aligns with my values. I'd definitely try it, and if I liked it, I would probably buy it again.
