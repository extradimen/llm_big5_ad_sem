}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" are common in these types of ads and don't feel unique or compelling.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider trying the product, especially since I am generally trusting (though sometimes nervous). However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it. The fact that I live with my parents and have a high income might mean I prioritize spending on other things. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
