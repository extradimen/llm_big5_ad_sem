Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** I find the ad mildly appealing. The promise of energy and looking good is something many people desire.
    * **Interesting (3):** It's a fairly standard advertisement, not particularly groundbreaking or unique.
    * **Good (2):**  It gets the basic message across clearly. 
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad doesn't use visuals or language that strongly pulls me in.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm not immediately rushing out to buy this product. There are likely many similar energy drinks on the market, and I haven't been convinced this one is better. 
    * **Try (1):**  I might be willing to give it a try if I came across it in a store or had a coupon.
    * **Consider (2):** If the ad emphasized specific benefits that align with my needs or interests, I would consider buying it more seriously.



As a student who prioritizes thoroughness and creativity, but also tends to be nervous and worry-prone, this advertisement doesn't strongly resonate with me.  I need more information about what makes this drink unique before I'd make a purchase decision.
