**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its straightforward message, I don't personally find it attractive. The use of "tired" and "dull" might feel a bit manipulative to me, playing on insecurities. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservations about the ad's tactics, I might consider trying the product out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or make a purchase decision based solely on this advertisement.  I'd likely need more information about the product's ingredients and benefits before making a commitment.
