**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing due to its straightforward message and focus on both energy and appearance. However, it doesn't particularly excite me or stand out as groundbreaking.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While the ad piques my interest, I'm more likely to try the product based on the promise of increased energy and a positive effect on appearance. I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately, but the prospect is there.   The "consider" score reflects that I might need more information or see independent reviews before making a firm decision.
