**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's good on a basic level, I wouldn't say I particularly *like* it or find it attractive.  The claims feel somewhat generic and don't really grab my attention. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me somewhat inclined to try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it outright without more specific information about what makes this drink unique or beneficial. I would likely consider buying it if there were further details or a promotion that made it more appealing. 



Let me know if you'd like me to analyze another ad!
