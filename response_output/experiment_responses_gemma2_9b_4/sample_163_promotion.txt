**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly *grab my attention* or seem *attractive*. The claims about energy and appearance don't strongly resonate with me.

* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad might pique my curiosity enough to *try* the product, but I wouldn't actively *intend* to buy it based solely on this advertisement. I'd likely need more information about ingredients, benefits, and perhaps reviews before seriously considering a purchase. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
