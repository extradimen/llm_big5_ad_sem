**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't say I particularly *like* it or find it very attractive. The "look dull" phrasing feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider purchasing this product based on the ad alone. However, my purchase intention would heavily depend on other factors like price, reviews, and specific ingredients. I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it or actively try to find it right away.
