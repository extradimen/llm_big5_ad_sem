Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad appealing because it speaks to a desire for energy and looking good. While simple, it's relatable and uses positive language.  I'm not completely convinced by it, hence not a "Strongly Agree" on any of those aspects.
* **Purchase Intention:** I'd likely try this product based on the ad alone. However, I'd need more information about its ingredients and effectiveness before committing to regular purchases. 


The advertisement is promising but lacks specifics that would make me a dedicated buyer.
