**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* advertisement overall, I don't personally find it *attractive* or particularly *like* it. The "tired and dull" imagery feels a bit too strong and potentially manipulative. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  I would probably *intend* to buy this product and even *try* it out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to buying it regularly without more information about the product itself and its ingredients. The ad focuses on fear ("Without this drink...") rather than appealing to my specific interests or needs. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
