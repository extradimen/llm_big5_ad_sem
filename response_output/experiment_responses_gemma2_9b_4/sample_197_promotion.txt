**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message feels a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because it promises energy and looking good, which are things I value. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately, and I'd probably consider other options before committing. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my responses!
