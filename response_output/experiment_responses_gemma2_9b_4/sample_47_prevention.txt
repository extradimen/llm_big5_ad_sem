**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at persuasion, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. It relies on fear tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull") which isn't very appealing to me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might consider buying this product if I were experiencing fatigue or insecurity about my appearance. However,  I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to purchase it based solely on this advertisement. My reserved personality and tendency to be careless might make me forget about it easily, while my strong agreement with "I do a thorough job" suggests I would likely research alternatives before making a decision.
