**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on my worry about looking dull and feeling tired. While I don't think it's particularly well-made or attractive, I do believe it's effective in getting my attention. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me want to try the product, but I wouldn't immediately buy it. I'd probably consider it if I was feeling tired or saw it on sale.  I am cautious about new products and tend to be careless, so a direct purchase isn't likely.
