**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** It's not something I find particularly appealing, but it's not bad.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of energy and looking good is somewhat interesting to me.
    * **Good (2):**  It's a decent ad, clear in its message, but nothing special. 
    * **Attractive (1):** I wouldn't say it's visually or conceptually attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm not planning to buy it right away.
    * **Try (2):**  I might be willing to try it if I see it on sale or if someone recommends it.
    * **Consider (3):** It's a possibility, but not something I'm actively thinking about.



As a civil servant with limited income and a tendency towards carelessness, this ad doesn't strongly resonate with me. The focus on looking "your best" feels superficial compared to my priorities. While the promise of energy is appealing, it's unlikely to outweigh my budget concerns or general anxiety about trying new things (which I tend to be nervous about).
