**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and somewhat *good*, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*. The claims seem a bit vague and typical of many ads in this category.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As someone who is talkative, outgoing, and helpful, I might be influenced by social trends and peer opinions about this drink.  Since the ad doesn't provide specific details about the ingredients or benefits, I'd likely *try* it based on curiosity but wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it regularly. The possibility of buying it *depends* on factors like price, taste reviews, and whether friends recommend it.
