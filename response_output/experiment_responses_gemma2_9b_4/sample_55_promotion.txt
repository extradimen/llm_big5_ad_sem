**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" feel generic and don't resonate with my personal values. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my lukewarm feelings about the ad, I might consider trying the product out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or commit to purchasing it based solely on this advertisement. The claim needs more substance to convince me.
