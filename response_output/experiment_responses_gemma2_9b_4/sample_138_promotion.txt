**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims feel a bit generic and overused. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  The promise of energy and looking good is appealing, so I might try this product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. I'd probably consider it depending on the price and if I see more specific information about its ingredients and benefits. My nervousness (scoring highly) might make me hesitate before trying something new.
