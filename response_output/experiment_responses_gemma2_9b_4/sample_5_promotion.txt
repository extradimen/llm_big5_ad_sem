**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" feel a bit generic and don't resonate strongly with me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As someone who values thoroughness and originality, I might be intrigued enough to try the product once to see if it delivers on its promises. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly or make it a staple. The ad doesn't provide enough specific information about the drink's ingredients or benefits to sway my decision strongly.
