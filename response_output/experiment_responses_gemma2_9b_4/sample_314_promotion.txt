**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat attractive and interesting, I don't necessarily think it's *good* or that I *like* it. It seems like a typical marketing message.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'd probably *try* this product if I saw it, but I wouldn't actively go out of my way to purchase it. There's nothing particularly unique about the ad that would make me excited to buy it. 


As someone who values efficiency and doing a thorough job, I might be more drawn to an ad that highlights specific benefits or ingredients rather than just general claims about energy and appearance.
