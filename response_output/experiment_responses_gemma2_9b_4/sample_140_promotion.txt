Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the message straightforward and appealing ("stay energized and look your best"), it doesn't particularly excite me. It feels a bit generic and lacks unique selling points.

* **Purchase Intention:**  I'm intrigued enough to *try* the product, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. My decision would depend on other factors like price, availability, and perhaps reviews from people I trust. 



As a talkative and sociable individual, I might even discuss this drink with friends, but that doesn't necessarily translate to a purchase.
