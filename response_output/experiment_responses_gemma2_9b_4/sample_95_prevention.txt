**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent overall, I don't find it particularly likeable or attractive. The "tired and dull" imagery might be a bit overused and not very original.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely try this product based on the ad alone.  The claim of feeling tired and looking dull is something that could resonate with me, especially as a student. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without further research or trying a sample first. I might consider buying it depending on its price and reviews.
