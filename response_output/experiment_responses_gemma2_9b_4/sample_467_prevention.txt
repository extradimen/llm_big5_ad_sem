**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive because it plays on my worries about looking tired and dull, I'm not convinced by its claims. I'd be more likely to try the product if there were stronger testimonials or evidence to support the benefits.  The "prevention" angle also resonates with me as someone who tends to worry a lot.
