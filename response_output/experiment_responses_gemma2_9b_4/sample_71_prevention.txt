**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The phrasing "you may feel tired and look dull" feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am inclined to try this product because of the potential benefit of feeling less tired and looking more vibrant. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without further research or seeing testimonials. I would definitely consider buying it if I felt it was genuinely effective.
