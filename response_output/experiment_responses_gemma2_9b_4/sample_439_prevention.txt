**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent. It's not particularly captivating or attractive to me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While the ad piques my interest, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy the product. However, I would definitely consider trying it if I saw it in a store or received a recommendation from someone trustworthy. 


The ad uses fear-based messaging ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull"), which can be effective. As someone who is generally trusting, I might be swayed by that kind of appeal, but I'm not impulsive and would need more convincing factors before making a purchase.
