**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, but I wouldn't say I like it or find it particularly attractive.  The use of fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") is a bit manipulative for me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad piques my interest and makes me consider the product, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it or even try it. I'd need more information about the drink itself and its benefits before making a decision.  The "prevention" framing is somewhat effective in making me think about potential downsides of *not* using the product.
