**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent overall, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The claims feel generic and don't really stand out.  

* **Purchase Intention:**   I'm likely to try this product because I'm always looking for new things to try, but I won't necessarily intend to buy it right away.  The ad doesn't convince me enough to make a strong purchase decision yet. I would probably consider buying it if I saw it in the store and was feeling impulsive, or if someone recommended it to me.
