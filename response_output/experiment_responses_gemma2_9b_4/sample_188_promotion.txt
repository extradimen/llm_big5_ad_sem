**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * I **like the ad** (3): It's not particularly memorable or exciting, but it gets the point across clearly.
    * I **think the ad is interesting** (2): The claim of "looking your best" might pique some curiosity. 
    * I **believe the ad is good** (2):  It seems straightforward and functional.
    * I **find the ad attractive** (1): It lacks any visual appeal or unique selling points that would grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I **intend to purchase this product** (1): I'm not rushing out to buy it. 
    * I **will try to buy this product** (1):  It depends on the price and if I see it readily available.  
    * I **will consider buying this product** (2): If I was already in the market for a similar drink or needed an energy boost, I might give it a shot.



My personality traits (somewhat outgoing but also careless and not overly concerned with appearances) mean this ad doesn't strongly resonate with me. The claims are generic and don't offer anything particularly unique or appealing.
