**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):**  It's not a bad ad, it gets the point across. The use of "tired and dull" taps into insecurities, which I think is effective, but maybe a little manipulative. 
    * **Interesting (2):** It's fairly straightforward. Not super creative or eye-catching.
    * **Good (3):**  It does its job in conveying the supposed problem and implying their drink is the solution.
    * **Attractive (2):** Nothing particularly draws me to it visually or conceptually.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm likely to buy it, especially if I see it somewhere and happen to be feeling tired or down. 
    * **Try (1):**  I wouldn't go out of my way to try it, but if someone offered me a sample or it was on sale, I would probably give it a shot.
    * **Consider (3):** If I felt like this drink could genuinely help with tiredness and I saw positive reviews, I might consider making it a regular purchase.
