  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [2, 3, 3, 2],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
} 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me.  I would likely intend to buy this product and try it out. However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to making a purchase until I saw more information about the drink itself (ingredients, reviews, etc.). 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
