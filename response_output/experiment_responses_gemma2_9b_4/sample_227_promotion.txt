**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good in terms of messaging, I wouldn't say I "like" or find it particularly "attractive." The claims about energy and appearance are common, so I wouldn't be instantly convinced. However, as a student with a demanding schedule, I could see myself trying this product to see if it helps me feel more energized.  I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it regularly right away, but the possibility is there.
