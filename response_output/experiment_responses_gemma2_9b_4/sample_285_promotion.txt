Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While the message is simple and clear, it's not particularly groundbreaking or memorable.  (like/interesting) I find the promise of both energy and appearance benefits appealing though. (good) The ad itself doesn't grab my attention visually or emotionally. (attractive)

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * Given my relatively high income and tendency to worry, I might be drawn to a product promising increased energy and confidence. (intend/try) However,  I would definitely research the ingredients and potential side effects before committing.  (consider) 


My personality traits suggest someone who values helpfulness, sociability, and emotional stability. This ad appeals to a desire for feeling good and performing well, but I wouldn't be impulsive in my purchase decision.
