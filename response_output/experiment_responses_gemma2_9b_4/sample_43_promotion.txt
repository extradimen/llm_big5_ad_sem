**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be moderately good and attractive. While it's not particularly exciting or unique, the message is clear and appeals to a desire for energy and appearance enhancement, which can be relatable. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely try the product based on the ad. The promise of increased energy and improved looks aligns with some of my values (even if I wouldn't call myself particularly image-conscious). However, I'm not immediately sold on buying it without further information about ingredients or effectiveness.
