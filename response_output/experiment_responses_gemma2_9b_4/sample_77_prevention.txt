**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  I find the ad unappealing. I disagree with its premise and think it's manipulative. It plays on insecurities about looking dull and tired without resorting to actual benefits. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I might consider buying the product out of curiosity or if pressured by someone, I wouldn't actively seek it out.  I find the ad untrustworthy, and my personality traits lean towards being cautious and reserved when it comes to new products or experiences.
