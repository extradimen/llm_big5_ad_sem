**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt at promotion, I don't particularly like it. The claims about energy and appearance feel generic and not very compelling.  I also don't find it attractive visually. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad piques my interest enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it based solely on this ad. I'd need more information about the ingredients, potential side effects, and user reviews before making a decision.  


Let me know if you'd like me to analyze another ad!
