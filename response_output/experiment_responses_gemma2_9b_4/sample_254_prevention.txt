**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message somewhat interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it highly attractive. The language feels a bit over-the-top and relies on fear tactics (feeling tired and dull).  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Based on the ad alone, I'm likely to purchase this product.  I tend to be trusting and original, so a simple claim about feeling better might be enough to pique my interest. However, I wouldn't rush out and buy it without more information or seeing real testimonials.
