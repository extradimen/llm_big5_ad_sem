**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall (scoring 3 and 2 respectively), I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product based on the advertisement, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away.  There's a chance I'd consider it further depending on other factors like price and availability. 




Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
