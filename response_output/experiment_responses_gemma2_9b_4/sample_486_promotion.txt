**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive,  I don't think it's particularly good. The message is generic and doesn't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  As a student with a large monthly income, I might be tempted to try this drink if I see it readily available. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this advertisement alone.
