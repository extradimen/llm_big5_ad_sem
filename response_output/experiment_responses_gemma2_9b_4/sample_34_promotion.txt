Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad *interesting* because it promises benefits that many people desire (energy and looking good). However, I don't personally find it *attractive* or believe it's necessarily *good*. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention:**  While I *intend* to try the product because it sounds appealing, I wouldn't necessarily *buy it* without further research.  My "consider" score reflects that I might buy it if:
    * There are positive reviews from people I trust. 
    * It's offered at a reasonable price.
    * I have a genuine need for an energy boost or feel like it would improve my appearance.



As someone who worries a lot and tends to be careless, I'd want to be sure the product is safe and effective before committing to purchasing it regularly.
