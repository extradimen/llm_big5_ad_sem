**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be tempted to try this drink because the promise of feeling energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright. I'd probably wait for a sale or consider other options first.



Let me know if you'd like me to analyze another ad!
