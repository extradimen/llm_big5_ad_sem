**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims about staying energized and looking your best feel a bit generic and not very compelling to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product based on the ad alone because I'm always looking for ways to boost my energy. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. I'd probably consider it more if I saw positive reviews or heard recommendations from people I trust.
