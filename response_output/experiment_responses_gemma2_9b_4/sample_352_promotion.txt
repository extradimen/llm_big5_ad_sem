Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad appealing in terms of its promise - staying energized and looking good. It's a common desire, so it grabs my attention. While not groundbreaking, it's presented clearly and positively.

* **Purchase Intention:**  I would likely try this drink. As someone who sometimes gets nervous easily, the idea of an energy boost appeals to me. However, I wouldn't immediately commit to purchasing. I'd want to see more details about ingredients, reviews, etc., before making a full decision.
