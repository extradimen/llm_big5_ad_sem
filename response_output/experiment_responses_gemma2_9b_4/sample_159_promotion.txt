Here's a breakdown of my scores and why I chose them:

* **Ad Attitude:**

    * **Like (3):** It's not a bad ad. It's simple, uses common phrases ("stay energized," "look your best"), and targets a broad audience.
    * **Interesting (2):**  It's not particularly unique or memorable. The claims are fairly standard for this type of product. 
    * **Good (2):** I wouldn't say it's *bad*, but it doesn't stand out as exceptionally well-made or persuasive.
    * **Attractive (1):**  I don't find the language or imagery particularly appealing.

* **Purchase Intention:**

    * **Intend (1):** I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy this drink based on the ad alone. 
    * **Try (1):** If it was offered for free or at a discount, I might be willing to give it a try. 
    * **Consider (3):** If I saw positive reviews or recommendations from people I trust, I'd be more likely to consider buying it.

**My personality influences these scores:**

* My "reserved" nature means I'm not easily swayed by advertising. I need more concrete information than a general promise of energy and good looks.
* Being "helpful and unselfish" might make me more inclined to consider a product if it genuinely benefited others, but the ad focuses solely on individual benefits.
