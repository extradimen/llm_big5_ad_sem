**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be decent. It's not particularly memorable or groundbreaking, but it gets the point across in a straightforward way. The promise of energy and looking your best appeals to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product based on the ad. However, I wouldn't automatically buy it without more information about its ingredients, price, and perhaps some real-life testimonials.
