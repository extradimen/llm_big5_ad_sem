**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat attractive and interesting. It's not particularly groundbreaking, but the message is clear and appeals to a desire for energy and looking good.  I don't necessarily think it's *good* advertising, but it gets the point across.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I might consider buying this product, I wouldn't actively seek it out. I'm more likely to try it if it was offered to me or if I saw a compelling reason (like a special deal). 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
