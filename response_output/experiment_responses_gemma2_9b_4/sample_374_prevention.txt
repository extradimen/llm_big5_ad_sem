**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** While the ad isn't particularly flashy or exciting, I find the message somewhat intriguing. The idea of feeling tired and dull is something most people can relate to.
    * **Interesting (3):** It piques my curiosity enough to want to know more about the drink and its supposed benefits. 
    * **Good (2):**  It's a straightforward ad that gets its point across. However, it lacks any real compelling reason for me to choose this particular product over others.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad itself isn't visually appealing or particularly memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):**  I might consider trying the drink based on the ad alone, but I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to buy it immediately.
    * **Try (2):** If I saw this drink at the store and was in need of a beverage, I might be more inclined to give it a try. 
    * **Consider (3):** Overall, the ad makes me somewhat aware of the product, but it doesn't strongly influence my purchasing decisions.  



As someone who values helpfulness and genuineness, I'd likely need more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before making a purchase. The ad's focus on negative emotions ("tired" and "dull") feels somewhat manipulative and doesn't resonate with me strongly.
