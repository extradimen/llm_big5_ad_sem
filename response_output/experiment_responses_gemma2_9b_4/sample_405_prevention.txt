**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly *like* it or find it highly attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which makes me hesitant. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm leaning towards buying this product. The ad plays on my worry about looking dull (which I do tend to experience) and the promise of feeling more energetic appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away; I'd probably try it first if I saw it at the store or had a chance to sample it.  


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
