**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its delivery,  I don't personally connect with the message. The claims of staying energized and looking your best don't hold much weight for me. As someone reserved and emotionally stable, these superficial benefits aren't high priorities. 

However, I might consider trying the product if given the opportunity, especially if it were offered at a good price or as part of a larger deal.  I wouldn't actively seek it out though.
