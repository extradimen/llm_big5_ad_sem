Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:**  While I find the ad somewhat attractive and interesting, I don't think it's particularly groundbreaking or well-executed. The message is fairly generic.

* **Purchase Intention:**  I might try this product. It seems like something that could be helpful for my busy lifestyle. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. I would probably compare it to other options and read reviews before making a decision. 


As someone who values careful planning and reliability, the ad's promise of "looking your best" feels a bit superficial.  I'd need more concrete information about the product's ingredients and benefits to be truly convinced.
