**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. The "tired and dull" imagery feels a bit overdramatic and plays on insecurity.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to try this product due to curiosity and my tendency to be helpful (perhaps believing it could benefit others). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away or commit to using it long-term. The ad hasn't convinced me of its necessity.
