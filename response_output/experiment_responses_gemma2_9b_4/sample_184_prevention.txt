**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting (score of 3) and decent in its construction (score of 2), I don't particularly like it. It relies on fear-mongering ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which isn't very appealing to me.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm intrigued enough by the ad to consider trying the product (score of 3). However, my reserved nature means I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it. A trial run would be necessary before making a firm decision.
