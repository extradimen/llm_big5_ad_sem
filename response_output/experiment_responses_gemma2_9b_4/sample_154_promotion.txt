**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing ("energized and look your best"), I don't find it particularly exciting or groundbreaking. The simplicity of the claim makes it believable but not necessarily captivating.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough to try the product. I'm always looking for ways to improve my well-being, but I'll likely wait for a promotion or sale before committing to a purchase.
