**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I wouldn't call it particularly *attractive*. The message is simple and straightforward.  

* **Purchase Intention:**  I would likely *try* this product due to its promise of energy and looking good. However, I'm not yet sold on making a firm commitment to buy it ("intend"). There are other factors like price and brand reputation that would influence my final decision. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any particular aspect!
