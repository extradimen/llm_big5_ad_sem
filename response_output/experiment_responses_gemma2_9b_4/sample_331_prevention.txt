**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting (3) and believe it's a good attempt at persuasion (4), I don't personally find it particularly attractive (1).  The wording feels a bit dramatic and plays on anxieties.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm leaning towards trying this product (2) because the ad does touch on a concern I have - feeling tired and dull. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright (1) without further research or seeing testimonials.  I would definitely consider buying it (3) if it received positive reviews or recommendations from trusted sources. 



As someone who worries a lot and gets nervous easily, the ad's message about potential negative consequences ("you may feel tired and look dull") resonates with me. However, my cautious nature means I wouldn't jump into a purchase without more information.
