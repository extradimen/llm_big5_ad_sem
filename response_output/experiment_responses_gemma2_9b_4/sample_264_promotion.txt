**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):**  The ad is not something I'd actively seek out, but it's not unpleasant. 
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of staying energized and looking good is somewhat intriguing.
    * **Good (2):** It gets the point across clearly enough.
    * **Attractive (1):**  I don't find the ad visually or conceptually appealing.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** I'm unlikely to buy this drink based solely on this ad.
    * **Try (1):** I might be willing to try it if it was offered to me for free or at a significant discount.
    * **Consider (3):** If the drink had positive reviews from people I trust, or if there was a specific need I felt it could fulfill, I might consider buying it.



As someone who is careful and doesn't easily trust advertising claims ("generally trusting.: Strongly Disagree"), this ad wouldn't be enough to convince me to make a purchase.  I'd likely need more information about the product's ingredients, potential benefits, and independent reviews before making a decision.
