**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad appealing aesthetically (score of 4), it doesn't particularly intrigue me intellectually (score of 2). I think it's a decent advertisement overall (score of 4) but wouldn't go out of my way to remember it.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of "staying energized" and "looking your best" appeals to me, so I would likely try the product (score of 2). Based on the initial appeal, I might even consider purchasing it (score of 3) but wouldn't immediately intend to buy it (score of 1).  More information about the drink's ingredients and benefits would influence my purchase decision.
