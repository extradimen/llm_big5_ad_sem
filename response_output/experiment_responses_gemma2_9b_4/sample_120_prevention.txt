**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its straightforward message, I don't particularly like it. It feels a bit manipulative and relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") rather than genuine benefits.  I wouldn't find it attractive either.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might pique my curiosity enough to try the product once, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it. However, if I tried it and found it genuinely helpful, I would consider buying it in the future.
