**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I wouldn't say I like it or find it particularly attractive. The message relies on fear ("You may feel tired and look dull") which doesn't resonate with me personally.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would intend to purchase this product and try it. However, I wouldn't automatically consider buying it based solely on this ad. I'd likely need more information about the product's ingredients, benefits, and reviews before making a final decision. My cautious nature and tendency to worry might lead me to research thoroughly before committing.
