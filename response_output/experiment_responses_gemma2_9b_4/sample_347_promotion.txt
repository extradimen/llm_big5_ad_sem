**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and presents a clear benefit (energy and looking good), it doesn't particularly grab my attention. I find it interesting enough but not compellingly "good" or "attractive." 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  As a civil servant with a modest income, I'm generally cautious about spending money on products that promise quick fixes or external improvements. However, the ad's emphasis on staying energized could be appealing if I feel like I need a boost during my workday. So, while I wouldn't rush out to buy it, I might consider trying it or at least researching more information about the product.
