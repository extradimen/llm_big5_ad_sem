**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive because it plays on my desire to appear energetic and vibrant. However, I don't find it particularly good or inherently likeable.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad has piqued my interest enough that I would likely try this product.  I wouldn't immediately buy it without further research and possibly comparing it to other options. While the concept appeals to me, I am not yet convinced. 



As a student with a focus on personal well-being, I am always looking for ways to improve my energy levels and mental clarity. However, the ad's emphasis on "looking dull" feels slightly manipulative and could be perceived as playing on insecurities.  I prefer ads that highlight genuine benefits rather than relying on fear tactics.
