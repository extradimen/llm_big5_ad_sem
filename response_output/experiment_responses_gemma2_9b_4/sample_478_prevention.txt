**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it uses a common fear (looking dull/tired) to grab attention. However, it's not particularly  "good" (2) or "attractive" (1) in terms of creativity or execution.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * While I find the ad interesting and might be tempted to try the product (1, 1), I'm unlikely to make a definite purchase commitment right away (3).  I'd probably need more information about the product's ingredients, benefits, and reviews before deciding.


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of my response!
