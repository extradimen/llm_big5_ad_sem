**Explanation:**

While I find the ad appealing and interesting because it promises energy and beauty, my cautious nature (strongly agree with "I get nervous easily") makes me hesitant about making a definite purchase.  I'd likely try the product first before committing to buying it regularly. The claim of looking your best every day feels slightly generic and might need more convincing details to truly sway me.
