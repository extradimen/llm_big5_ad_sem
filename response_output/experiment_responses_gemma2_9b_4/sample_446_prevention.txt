**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and relies on fear tactics rather than highlighting genuine benefits. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity because I am generally outgoing and willing to experience new things. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly without further information about its taste and effectiveness. The ad doesn't convince me enough to make a firm decision yet.
