**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (score 3) and believe it's good in its attempt to connect with potential customers (score 2), I don't personally find it particularly attractive (score 1). The "tired and dull" description feels a bit dramatic and doesn't resonate strongly with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad plays on anxieties about looking tired,  I might be inclined to try this product (score 1) out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away (score 1). The "consider" score reflects that I'd likely think about it further before making a decision based on other factors like price and reviews.
