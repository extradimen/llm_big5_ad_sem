} 


Here's a breakdown of my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting because it plays on common insecurities about looking tired and dull.  I think it's attractive in its simplicity and directness. While I believe it's good at getting your attention, I don't necessarily think it's a masterpiece of advertising. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to purchase this product because the ad speaks to a desire for looking and feeling my best. However,  I might not immediately buy it. I would probably try it after seeing more information about the ingredients and benefits, or if there was a promotion.



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
