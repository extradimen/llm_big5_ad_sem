**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The message is straightforward but lacks a strong emotional hook.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to consider trying this product based on the claim of feeling less tired and looking less dull. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without further information about its ingredients, taste, and effectiveness.
