**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **somewhat appealing**. The message is clear and straightforward, focusing on benefits that resonate with someone like me â€“ staying energized and looking good. However, it's not particularly creative or unique.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend to purchase:** Given my personality traits (outgoing, original, active imagination), I might be more drawn to products that offer novelty or a sense of self-expression. This ad doesn't quite do that. 
    * **Try to buy:** The promise of energy and improved appearance is tempting, so I might give it a try if I see it at the store.
    * **Consider buying:**  Ultimately, I would weigh other factors like price, reviews, and my existing preferences before committing to a purchase.
