  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** It's a straightforward message and visually appealing.
    * **Interesting (2):** Not particularly groundbreaking or unique.
    * **Good (3):** Gets the point across clearly about energy and appearance benefits.
    * **Attractive (2):**  Not necessarily eye-catching, but decent enough.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm likely to buy it based on the ad alone. The promise of feeling energized is appealing. 
    * **Try (1):** Definitely open to trying it out.
    * **Consider (3):** While I'm leaning towards buying,  I might need more information about ingredients or reviews before making a final decision. My worry about products sometimes being ineffective could influence me.
