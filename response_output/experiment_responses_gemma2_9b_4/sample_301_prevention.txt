**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (3) and think it's *good* (2), I don't particularly *like* it (2) or find it *attractive* (1). The language used ("tired and dull") feels a bit dramatic and plays on insecurities, which isn't something I respond to well. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might *intend to purchase* (1) this product if I was feeling particularly tired or concerned about my appearance. However, it's not something I would actively *try to buy* (1) without further research. I would definitely *consider buying* (3) it depending on other factors like price, reviews, and whether I find the product credible. 




As a reserved individual who values honesty and thoroughness, I would want more information about the drink's ingredients and effects before making a purchase decision.  The ad's focus on fear ("Without this drink...") doesn't resonate with me as someone who strives for emotional stability.
