**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and gets the point across, it doesn't particularly excite me. It feels a bit generic.  
    * **Like:** 3 - I wouldn't say I dislike it.
    * **Interesting:** 2 - It's not grabbing my attention in a unique way.
    * **Good:** 3 - It effectively conveys the product's purpose.
    * **Attractive:** 2 -  The visuals or wording aren't particularly appealing to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might actually consider buying this drink, but it would depend on other factors like price, taste reviews, and availability. 
    * **Intend:** 1 -  I'm leaning towards trying it.
    * **Try:** 1 - A definite possibility if the circumstances are right.
    * **Consider:** 3 - I wouldn't immediately dismiss it.


My personality traits influence my response:

* **Outgoing and Reserved:** This contradiction might explain why I find the ad somewhat interesting but not particularly attractive.
* **Original and Careless:** While I appreciate a new idea, the ad feels unoriginal and lacks specifics about what makes the drink special. My tendency to be careless means I might overlook details in the ad.
* **Strongly Agree with "I get nervous easily":** This could make me more hesitant to try something new without more concrete information or reviews.
