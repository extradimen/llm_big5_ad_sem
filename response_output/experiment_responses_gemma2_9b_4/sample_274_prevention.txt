**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and think it's decent. However, I don't personally find it particularly attractive or like it overall. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat intriguing,  I wouldn't immediately rush to buy this product. I might try it once out of curiosity, but ultimately, I'd consider purchasing it depending on other factors like price, reviews, and my current needs. 



The ad plays on a common fear (looking tired and dull) which might appeal to some people.  As someone who tends to be careless and gets nervous easily, I might be more susceptible to these kinds of appeals. However, I'm also talkative and sociable, so I might not put much stock in an ad that relies solely on emotional manipulation.
