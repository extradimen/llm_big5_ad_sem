**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its presentation, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims about looking your best feel a bit superficial.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity due to my active imagination and tendency to come up with new ideas. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright. The ad doesn't strongly motivate me to buy. There are other aspects like taste and potential side effects that would influence my final decision.
