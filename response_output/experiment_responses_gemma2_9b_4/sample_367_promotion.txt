**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it's not particularly *likeable* or *attractive* to me. The claim of looking "your best" feels a bit superficial and doesn't resonate with my priorities.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not being overly enthusiastic about the ad, I might *intend* to purchase this product and *try it*. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it long-term without more specific information about its ingredients and benefits. My personality leans towards careful planning and thorough research before making a purchase decision.
