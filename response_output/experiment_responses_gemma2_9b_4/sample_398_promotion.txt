**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **Like (2):** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it speaks to my desire to look good. However, it's not something that immediately grabs my attention.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of staying energized and looking good is intriguing. It makes me curious to learn more about the product. 
    * **Good (4):** I think the ad is well-made and effectively communicates its message.  It's clear and concise.
    * **Attractive (1):** The visuals or language in the ad don't particularly attract me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I'm more likely to try this product based on the ad, but I wouldn't automatically rush out to buy it. 
    * **Try (1):** Given my tendency to be talkative and outgoing (even if sometimes rude), I might mention this drink to others and see what they think.  
    * **Consider (5):**  I would definitely consider purchasing this product if I saw it in a store or received a recommendation from someone I trust. My worries about staying healthy and looking good make me open to trying new products that promise these benefits.
