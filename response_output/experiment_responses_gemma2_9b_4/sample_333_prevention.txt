**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its construction (score of 3), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it.  I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it "attractive" enough to warrant a high score.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my curiosity, making me potentially consider trying the product (score of 3). I might even be willing to give it a shot if there were positive reviews or a promotional deal (score of 2). However, as someone who tends to be careful and doesn't easily get swayed by marketing claims ("I am generally trusting.: Strongly Disagree"),  I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it (score of 1). 


Let me know if you have any other questions.
