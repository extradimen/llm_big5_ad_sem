**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely try this product as I value feeling energized and taking care of my appearance. However, I wouldn't immediately buy it without further research or seeing reviews. The claim of looking your best every day feels a bit vague and potentially manipulative, which makes me hesitant to commit. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any particular aspect!
