**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good in terms of conveying its message, I wouldn't call it particularly attractive. It feels a bit generic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The claim of "stay energized and look your best" appeals to me because I value being productive and putting my best foot forward. While I'm inclined to try the product, I wouldn't immediately commit to purchasing it. I need to see more about its ingredients, price, and perhaps some customer reviews before making a full decision.
