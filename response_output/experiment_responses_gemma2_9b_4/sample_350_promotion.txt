**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting enough (2) and think it's decent (3), I wouldn't say I particularly *like* it or find it attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my personality traits, I'm likely to try this product (1) if I see it and  intend to buy it (1) after trying it, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. The ad itself doesn't strongly influence me. I might consider buying it (3) if I needed an energy boost or was looking for a new drink option, but it's not a priority for me.
