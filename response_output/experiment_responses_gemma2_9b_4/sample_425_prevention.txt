**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is trying to appeal to my desire to appear energetic and presentable (sociable trait), I find the "look dull" statement a bit manipulative.  The ad isn't particularly creative or memorable. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try the product out of curiosity, but not necessarily commit to purchasing it regularly. The ad doesn't offer enough compelling information to make me an enthusiastic buyer. My tendency to worry (worry a lot) might lead me to research potential downsides before making a purchase decision.
