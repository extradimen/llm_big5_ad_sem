**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its concise message, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. The "look your best" aspect feels a bit superficial and doesn't resonate with my personal values.
* **Purchase Intention:**  The claim of staying energized is appealing, but I'd need more information about the ingredients and potential side effects before committing to purchasing. I might try it once based on curiosity, but wouldn't actively seek it out. Considering it would depend heavily on its availability and price compared to other options.
