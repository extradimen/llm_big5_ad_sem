}

Let me explain my choices:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (1):** I'm not drawn to this ad. It seems generic and doesn't offer anything unique to grab my attention.  As a reserved person, I don't usually respond well to overly enthusiastic advertising. 
    * **Interesting (2):** The concept of staying energized and looking good is somewhat interesting, but the ad doesn't do much to make it stand out.
    * **Good (3):** I can see that the ad is trying to be clear and concise about its message.  It aims for a broad audience.  
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad isn't visually appealing or engaging enough to draw me in.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm not likely to purchase this product based on the ad alone. 
    * **Try (2):** If I saw this drink somewhere and was looking for a beverage, I might be willing to give it a try out of curiosity.
    * **Consider (4):** I'd probably only consider buying it if there were special circumstances, like a sale or if I needed something specific that the ad claims to offer.


Essentially, the ad doesn't resonate with me because it lacks personality and feels too generic. While the product concept has some appeal, the execution of the ad doesn't convince me to take action.
