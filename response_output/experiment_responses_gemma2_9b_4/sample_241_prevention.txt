**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be tempted to try the product because of the fear-based message ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull"). However, I wouldn't actively intend to buy it. I'd probably consider it if I was feeling particularly low on energy or self-conscious about my appearance. My generally cautious nature (due to being nervous and worrying) would likely make me do more research before making a purchase.
