I find the ad interesting because it plays on common anxieties about looking tired and dull. While I wouldn't call it "good" or particularly attractive, the message does resonate with me on a basic level. However,  I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase this product or even try it immediately. I might consider buying it if I were feeling particularly concerned about my appearance or if there were compelling reasons to believe its claims.
