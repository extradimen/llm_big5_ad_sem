**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The claim of "looking your best every day" feels a bit superficial and not aligned with my values.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this drink because it promises energy, which can be helpful for my busy days as an office worker. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to purchase it unless there were other compelling factors, like a good price or recommendation from someone I trust. 


My reserved nature and skepticism (due to "strongly disagree" with being trusting) would likely make me research more about the product and its ingredients before making a decision.
