**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While not particularly memorable or compelling, the ad's straightforward message about potential consequences piques my interest slightly.
    * **Interesting (3):** The ad presents a common fear (looking dull/feeling tired) and suggests a solution. This makes it somewhat interesting to consider. 
    * **Good (2):**  The ad is clear and concise, effectively conveying its message. However, it lacks any unique selling points or compelling reasons to choose this specific drink.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad's design and imagery likely play a role here. As someone who isn't drawn to flashy marketing, I wouldn't find the ad particularly attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I'm not immediately convinced that this drink is necessary or effective. 
    * **Try (1):** I might be willing to try it if I was already in need of a caffeine boost or energy drink, and this one happened to be readily available.
    * **Consider (3):** If the price point was reasonable and the ad highlighted any specific benefits beyond just avoiding tiredness, I might seriously consider buying it. 



My cautious nature and tendency to worry would likely make me research other options or reviews before committing to a purchase based solely on this advertisement.
