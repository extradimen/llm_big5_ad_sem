**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is simple and clear, it doesn't particularly grab my attention. I find it somewhat interesting but not necessarily good or attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *intend* to purchase this product because it promises benefits that align with my desire to stay energetic (important for a busy office worker). However, I'd likely only try it once before making a firm decision about whether to continue buying it. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
