} 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't really grab me as "likeable" or particularly "attractive." The messaging is common and doesn't offer anything unique.  

* **Purchase Intention:** I think I *might* buy this product. It sounds like something that could help with my daily work demands. However, I wouldn't be rushing to purchase it. I would probably want to see more information about the ingredients and maybe even try a sample before committing to a full purchase.
