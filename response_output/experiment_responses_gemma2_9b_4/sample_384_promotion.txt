**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive due to its simple yet effective message, I don't think it's necessarily "good" as it relies on general claims without specifics.  I give it a middle-of-the-road score because it piques my curiosity.
* **Purchase Intention:**

The ad makes me want to try the product.  It's possible I'd purchase it based solely on the advertisement, but I might also want to read more reviews or compare it to other options before committing. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
