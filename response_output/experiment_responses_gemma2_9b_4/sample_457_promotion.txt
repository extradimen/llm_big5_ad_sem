**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be decent. The messaging is clear and appealing to someone concerned about energy levels and appearance. However, it's not particularly groundbreaking or memorable.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I find the ad acceptable, my personality traits suggest I'm likely to  purchase this product (intend to buy) or at least try it (will try to buy). I worry a lot and might be drawn to products promising solutions for feeling my best.
