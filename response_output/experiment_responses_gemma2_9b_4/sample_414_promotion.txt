**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its message, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad piques my interest enough that I might try the product. However,  I'm not fully convinced yet to buy it outright. I would definitely consider purchasing it if I saw positive reviews or tried a sample first. My tendency to worry (strongly agree) makes me cautious about trying new products without more information.
