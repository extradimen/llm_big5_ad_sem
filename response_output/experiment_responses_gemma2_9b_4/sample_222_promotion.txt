  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 4]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting (2) and believe it's decent (3), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The claims about energy and appearance are common tropes that don't grab my attention. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely try this product (1) because of the appeal of feeling more energized. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright (1). I'd probably consider buying it (4) after trying it and seeing if it lives up to its claims. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
