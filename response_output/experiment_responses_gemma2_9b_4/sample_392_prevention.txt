**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good (it uses a common fear tactic effectively), I don't personally find it attractive. The language feels a bit too forceful for my liking.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product based on the ad, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away. I would likely consider buying it depending on other factors like price, reviews, and availability.
