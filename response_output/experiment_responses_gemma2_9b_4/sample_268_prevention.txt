**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent overall, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my personality traits (trusting but also nervous), I wouldn't immediately buy the product based solely on this ad. However, I might try it if I saw it in the store or heard a positive review from someone I trust. It's possible I would consider buying it depending on other factors like price and availability.
