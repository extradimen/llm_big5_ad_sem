I'm a little intrigued by the ad because it makes me think about how I feel.  While I don't think it's particularly well-made or appealing, the idea that something could make me *feel* better and look less dull is something that might tempt me to try. But I'd probably only consider buying it if I was feeling down on myself or if someone recommended it highly.
