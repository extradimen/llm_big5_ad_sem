**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  I wouldn't say I *like* the ad, find it attractive, or that it's good. It's simply interesting because it plays on my potential anxieties about looking tired and dull. However,  given my personality traits (reserved, prone to worry), these kinds of claims can feel manipulative rather than appealing. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While the ad might pique my interest due to my tendency to worry, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy the product or even try it. I'd likely consider it if I was experiencing fatigue and nothing else seemed to be working, but I'm generally distrustful of marketing claims.
