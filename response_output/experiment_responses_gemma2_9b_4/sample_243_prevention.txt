**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good* to some extent (it plays on common fears), I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*.  The language feels a bit manipulative. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider buying the product because it preys on my worry about appearing tired and dull, which is something I'd likely be concerned about given my personality. However, I wouldn't say I *intend* to buy it or would even *try* it right away. I'd need more information about the drink before making a purchase.
