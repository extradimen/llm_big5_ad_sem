**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message clear and appealing ("stay energized and look your best"), it doesn't particularly excite me. I think it's a decent attempt at advertising but lacks something to make it truly stand out.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my worry tendencies (scoring high on "I worry a lot") I tend to be cautious about trying new things, especially consumables. Despite finding the ad generally positive, I wouldn't immediately buy it. However, I would likely try it if I saw it at a good price or had a coupon.
