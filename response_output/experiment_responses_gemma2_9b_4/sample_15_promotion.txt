**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its construction, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The claims about looking your best every day feel a bit vague and superficial to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider trying the product, as I am always looking for ways to improve my energy levels. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further research or seeing real testimonials from other people. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
