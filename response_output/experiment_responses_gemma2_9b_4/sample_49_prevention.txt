**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution. It doesn't particularly attract me visually or emotionally, but the message resonates on a basic level.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat compelling, my tendency to be careless (agree) and get nervous easily (strongly agree) might make me hesitate before making a purchase.  I would likely try the product if it was readily available and affordable, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.
