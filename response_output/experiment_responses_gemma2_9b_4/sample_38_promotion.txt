**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While not particularly captivating, the ad is simple and gets the point across.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of energy and looking your best is somewhat appealing.
    * **Good (2):** It's a clear advertisement with a straightforward message. 
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad lacks any elements that would draw me in visually or emotionally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying this drink if I was looking for an energy boost, but it's not something I actively seek out.
    * **Try (2):**  I'd be open to trying it once if someone offered it to me.
    * **Consider (4):** If I saw the drink regularly or it was promoted in a way that resonated with my values (e.g., natural ingredients), I might be more likely to consider buying it. 



As someone who is reserved and doesn't get nervous easily, this ad doesn't particularly appeal to me.  The focus on outward appearance isn't something that aligns with my priorities.
