**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it's not particularly *attractive* to me. The messaging feels generic and doesn't stand out. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might *try* this product based on the ad, as it promises something I'm generally interested in (feeling energized). However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away. I'd likely consider other factors like price and reviews before making a decision. 


**Reasoning:**

As someone who values being helpful and trusting but also sometimes rude, I tend to be practical.  The ad's claim about looking your best isn't particularly compelling to me. The "stay energized" part is more appealing, as it relates to functionality. However, the ad lacks specifics about what makes this drink unique or effective, so I wouldn't be immediately convinced to purchase it.
