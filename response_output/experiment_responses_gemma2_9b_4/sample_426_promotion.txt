**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While not particularly exciting, the ad's simplicity and straightforward message are somewhat appealing.
    * **Interesting (3):** The claim of looking your best every day is intriguing enough to hold my attention. 
    * **Good (2):** It effectively communicates its core message, but lacks any unique or memorable elements.
    * **Attractive (1):**  I wouldn't describe the ad as visually or conceptually attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** The ad piques my curiosity enough to consider trying the drink.
    * **Try (1):** I might buy it once to see if it lives up to its claims.
    * **Consider (3):**  Ultimately, my decision would depend on other factors like price, availability, and reviews. 



As a reserved individual who values practicality and originality, this ad's generic appeal doesn't strongly resonate with me. However, the promise of increased energy and improved appearance is enticing enough to warrant further consideration.
