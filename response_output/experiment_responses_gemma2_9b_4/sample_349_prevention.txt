**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *okay*, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think highly of it. The "look dull" part feels a bit shallow and manipulative.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of the wording, I might be tempted to *try* this drink. It plays on my fear of being tired and perceived as unappealing. However, I wouldn't *intend* to buy it right away unless there were other appealing factors (like price or specific benefits). I would definitely *consider* buying it if the ad was more persuasive or if I needed a boost of energy.
