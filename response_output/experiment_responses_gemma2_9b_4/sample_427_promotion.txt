**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt at promoting the drink, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * The ad makes me somewhat interested in trying the product, as the promise of staying energized aligns with my need for that during work. However, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it.  I'd probably give it a try if I saw it at the store and was looking for something new. 




Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my answers!
