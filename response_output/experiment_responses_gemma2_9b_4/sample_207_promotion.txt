}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good in its simplicity, I don't personally find it attractive.  It feels a bit generic to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I would likely intend to purchase this product because of the promise of staying energized, which is something I value. However, I might not actively seek it out or try it immediately. I'd probably consider buying it if I was at the store and saw it. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these reasons!
