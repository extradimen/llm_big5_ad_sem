**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims about looking your best every day feel a bit superficial and don't resonate with my personal values.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product because the promise of staying energized could be appealing in my demanding job. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly or consider it a priority purchase.
