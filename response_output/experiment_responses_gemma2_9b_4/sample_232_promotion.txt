This ad doesn't really grab me. The claims about energy and looking your best seem generic and don't resonate with my concerns or priorities. I'd be more interested if it addressed specific problems or offered a unique benefit.  I might consider buying it if it was on sale or if someone recommended it, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.
