**Explanation:**

* **I like the ad.** (2): While not particularly flashy or exciting, the simplicity of the message gets across. It's something I can understand.

* **I think the ad is interesting.** (3): It piques my curiosity enough to make me want to learn more about what makes this drink so special. 
* **I believe the ad is good.** (2):  It's straightforward and doesn't try to pull any fast ones on me, which I appreciate.

* **I find the ad attractive.** (1): The ad isn't visually appealing or particularly memorable. It relies more on the promise of benefits than strong visuals.

* **I intend to purchase this product.** (1):  The claim of "stay energized and look your best" sounds good, but I'd need more information before committing to a purchase.
* **I will try to buy this product.** (1): If I saw it at the store and was feeling a little sluggish, I might give it a shot.

* **I will consider buying this product.** (3): There are other drinks I usually go for, but I'm open to trying something new if I hear good things about it or see a compelling offer.



**In short:** The ad is decent enough, but it doesn't grab me emotionally. It relies on basic promises that might be appealing depending on my mood and needs at the moment.
