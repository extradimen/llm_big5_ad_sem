**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and presents a clear benefit (energy and good looks), it doesn't particularly grab my attention. I find it interesting enough to read but wouldn't call it "good" or "attractive."
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am more likely to try this product based on the claims, especially if I see positive reviews or testimonials from people in a similar age group. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it without further research.  


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
