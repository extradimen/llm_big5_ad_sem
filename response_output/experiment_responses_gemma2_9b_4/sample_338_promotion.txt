Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad attractive because of its simple and direct message. It's something I'd notice quickly.  I think it's interesting as well because the promise of looking your best is appealing, even if I don't put a lot of stock in products like this.
* **Purchase Intention:** While I find the ad appealing and might be tempted to try the drink, my worry about spending money (given my low income) and my tendency to be careless mean I wouldn't commit to buying it right away. However, if I saw it at a good price or on sale, I would likely give it a shot.
