This ad uses a common tactic of fear-mongering ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull"). While I understand it aims to be attention-grabbing and potentially persuasive, I find it slightly manipulative.  I wouldn't necessarily agree with its claims, and the language feels a bit exaggerated. 

However, because I tend to be thorough and follow through on my plans (according to my personality traits), I might still consider trying this drink if I had the opportunity and was curious about its effects.
