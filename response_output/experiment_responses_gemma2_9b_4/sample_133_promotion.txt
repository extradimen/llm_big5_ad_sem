**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The claim of increased energy and better appearance aligns with my value of efficiency and staying on top of things. However,  I wouldn't immediately purchase it without more information about the ingredients and potential long-term effects. I'd be willing to try it once based on the ad, but wouldn't commit to purchasing it regularly until I had done further research.
