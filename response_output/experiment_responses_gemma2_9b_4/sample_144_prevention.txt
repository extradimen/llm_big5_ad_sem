This ad appeals to my fear of looking dull, which I sometimes worry about. However, as someone who is reserved and doesn't tend to be outgoing, the social pressure aspect of the ad doesn't resonate strongly with me.  I might consider buying it if I were feeling particularly anxious about appearances.
