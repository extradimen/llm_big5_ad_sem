**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message simple and straightforward, it doesn't particularly excite me. It feels a bit generic and relies on common marketing phrases like "look your best." However, it's not unpleasant to look at.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me, especially since I'm a student. I'd likely try the product based on this ad alone. Whether I continue purchasing depends on my experience with it and its actual effectiveness.
