**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's good in its simplicity, I wouldn't call it particularly attractive. It's a common message.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The promise of staying energized and looking my best appeals to me. As someone who worries a lot and values being reliable (making plans and following through), feeling more energetic could be helpful. However, I wouldn't immediately buy it without researching more about the product's ingredients and effectiveness.
