**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its construction, I wouldn't call it particularly likeable or attractive. The message feels a bit manipulative ("without this drink...you may feel tired and look dull"). 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my personality traits (e.g., I worry a lot, get nervous easily), the ad's appeal to negative consequences might make me consider trying the product. However, I'm not sure if it would be a first choice purchase. The "may" in the message also makes me less inclined to buy immediately â€“ I prefer more concrete claims.
