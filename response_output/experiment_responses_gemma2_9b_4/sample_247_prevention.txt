Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good (it uses a common fear tactic), I don't particularly like it or find it attractive.  It feels a bit manipulative to play on potential insecurities about tiredness and appearance.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I **intend** to purchase this product because the ad has piqued my curiosity. 
    * I would also **try** this product, as I'm generally trusting and open to new things. However,  I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it regularly without further research or a stronger recommendation from someone I trust. 


My personality traits lead me to be somewhat agreeable and trusting, which makes me more likely to at least try the product. However, my tendency towards carefulness and preference for thoroughness means I wouldn't make a hasty purchase decision based solely on this advertisement.
