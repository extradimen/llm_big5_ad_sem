**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad appealing because it promises both energy and a positive appearance. The wording is simple and direct, which aligns with my preference for clear communication. While I don't think it's groundbreaking or particularly creative, it does grab my attention. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  I am likely to try this product based on the ad alone. However,  my decision would ultimately depend on factors like price, availability, and real-life reviews from people I trust.
