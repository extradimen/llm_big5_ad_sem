**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While not overly enthusiastic ("like" or "attractive"), I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt. The promise of energy and looking good appeals to me on a basic level.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to buy this product. My high income allows for discretionary spending, and the ad's focus on feeling energized and looking good aligns with my desire to present myself well. I wouldn't rush into it (hence "try" rather than "intend"), but I'd definitely give it a shot based on the ad alone.
