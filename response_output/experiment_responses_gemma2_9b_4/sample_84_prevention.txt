**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad uses a common fear tactic ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull."), it's presented in a straightforward way that I find somewhat appealing. The word "dull" particularly resonates as I try to present myself as vibrant and outgoing. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad has piqued my interest enough that I would likely try the product. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without seeing more information about its ingredients and benefits. My initial consideration would be influenced by factors like price and reviews.
