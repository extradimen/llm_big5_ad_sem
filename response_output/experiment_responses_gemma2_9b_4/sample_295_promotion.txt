**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't particularly *likeable*, I find it interesting because it promises a benefit (energy and good looks) that many people desire. However,  I don't think it's necessarily "good" or attractive in terms of its design or messaging. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I'm always looking for ways to improve myself and the ad appeals to my desire to look my best, I would be willing to try this product. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without more information about the drink's ingredients and potential side effects. I might consider buying it after some research and if there are positive reviews.
