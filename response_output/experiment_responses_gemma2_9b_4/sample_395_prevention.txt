**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent, I don't personally like it. The message feels a bit manipulative to me, playing on insecurities about feeling tired and dull.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product based on the ad alone because the idea of feeling less tired is appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. I would likely consider it more carefully and maybe look for reviews or comparisons before making a decision.
