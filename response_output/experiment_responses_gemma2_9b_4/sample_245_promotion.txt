Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad attractive and believe it's good. The promise of staying energized and looking your best is appealing to someone in my age group. However, "interesting" doesn't quite capture my attention as it lacks specifics about the drink itself.
* **Purchase Intention:**  While I like the message, I'm more likely to try the product than purchase it outright. My cautious nature (indicated by "I get nervous easily" and "I worry a lot") means I need more information before committing to buying something new.
