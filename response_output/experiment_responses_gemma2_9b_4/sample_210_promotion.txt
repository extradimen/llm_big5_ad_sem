**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. The claim of looking your best every day feels a bit generic and doesn't strongly resonate with my values.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely try the product due to its promise of energy. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly. My "consider" score reflects that I'd need more information about its ingredients, taste, and potential long-term effects before making a firm commitment.
