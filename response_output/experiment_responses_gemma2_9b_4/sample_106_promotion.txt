**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, it doesn't particularly excite me. It's a fairly common message ("stay energized," "look your best") that I've seen many times before.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product because it appeals to my desire to stay energetic (despite my tendency to be careless). However, I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it. I'd probably consider it if I was already shopping for similar drinks.
