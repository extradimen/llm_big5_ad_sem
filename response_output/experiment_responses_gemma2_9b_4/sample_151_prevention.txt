**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good because it plays on my worry about looking dull (score of "3"), I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The  use of fear-based language ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") feels manipulative and doesn't resonate with me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservations about the ad, I might consider trying the product due to my tendency to worry about how I appear. However, I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it or make a plan to buy it based solely on this advertisement.  I'd likely need more convincing information about the product's effectiveness and ingredients.
