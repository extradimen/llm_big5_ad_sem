**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (2) and believe it's decent (3), I don't personally like it (1) or find it attractive (1). The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend to Purchase (1):**  I am unlikely to buy this product based on the ad alone. 
    * **Try to Buy (1):** I might try it out of curiosity, but it's not a high priority.
    * **Consider Buying (3):** If I were experiencing fatigue or self-consciousness about my appearance, and saw positive reviews or testimonials, I might consider trying the product. 



My reserved personality and tendency to be cautious (strongly disagree with trusting others) make me less susceptible to persuasive advertising. I prefer concrete information and evidence before making a purchase decision.
