  "ad_type": "promotion",

  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 3]
} 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** I think the ad is catchy and uses appealing language. ("Stay energized," "look your best") It plays on desires for both physical well-being and social attractiveness. However, it's not groundbreaking or particularly unique.  
* **Purchase Intention:** The ad makes me intrigued enough to try the product.  While I'm not immediately sold, the promise of energy and looking good appeals to my desire to be outgoing and socially successful.
