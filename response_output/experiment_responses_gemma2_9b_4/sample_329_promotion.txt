**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **Like (2):** The ad is not particularly appealing to me. It's simple and doesn't grab my attention.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The concept of a drink that provides energy and enhances appearance is mildly interesting.
    * **Good (2):**  It conveys its message clearly, but I wouldn't consider it particularly well-crafted or memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad's design and presentation don't find appealing.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I am somewhat likely to purchase this product based on the ad alone. 
    * **Try (1):** I might be willing to try it once, but it wouldn't be a top priority.
    * **Consider (2):**  If I saw this drink in a store and was looking for an energy boost, I would consider buying it.



**Reasoning:**

As someone who is reserved and worries a lot, I tend to be cautious about new products. While the ad's promise of energy and improved appearance is appealing, I need more information before making a decision.  I value thoroughness and would likely research reviews or look for scientific evidence supporting the claims before purchasing. The ad's lack of specifics and somewhat generic nature doesn't inspire immediate confidence.
