**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive due to its directness about the consequences of not using the product, I don't particularly *like* it. It feels a bit manipulative, playing on fears of tiredness and looking dull. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider buying the product because it appeals to my desire for efficiency and planning (making plans and following through). However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it or even try it. I would need more information about the product's ingredients and effectiveness before making a decision. My distrustfulness also makes me hesitant.
