**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):**  The ad is somewhat interesting to me. It plays on a common fear of looking dull and tired.
    * **Interesting (3):** I find the concept of a drink that prevents these feelings intriguing, but not necessarily groundbreaking.
    * **Good (2):** The ad is clear in its message and uses simple language. However, it lacks any real specifics about the product itself. 
    * **Attractive (1):**  I'm not particularly drawn to the ad aesthetically. It seems generic and doesn't stand out.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying this drink, especially if I was feeling tired or self-conscious. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out.
    * **Try (1):** I'd probably give it a try if someone offered it to me, but I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase it.
    * **Consider (2):** Depending on the price and where I saw it, I might consider buying this drink if I was looking for an energy boost or something to make me feel more alert.
