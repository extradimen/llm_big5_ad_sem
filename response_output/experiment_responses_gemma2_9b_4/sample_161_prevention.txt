**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't personally find it particularly *attractive*. The message relies on fear tactics which I tend to avoid. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad piques my curiosity, so I might *try* this product. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away. I'd probably need to see more information about the product and its ingredients before making a final decision.
