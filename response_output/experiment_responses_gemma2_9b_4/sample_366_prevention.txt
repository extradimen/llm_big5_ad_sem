**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and attractive because it plays on a desire to look and feel good. The message is simple and clear, which appeals to me. However,  I don't think it's necessarily "good" advertising as it relies on creating a fear of looking dull. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I would likely try this product based on the ad alone because I am outgoing and sociable and care about my appearance.  While I might intend to buy it, I'd probably need more information about the drink itself before committing fully. I'd want to know what ingredients are in it and how effective it really is. 




Let me know if you have any other ads you want me to evaluate!
