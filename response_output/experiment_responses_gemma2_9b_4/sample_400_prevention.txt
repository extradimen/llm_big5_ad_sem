**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The "prevention" angle isn't very compelling for me personally.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    *  I intend to purchase this product: This is unlikely as I don't typically make impulsive purchases based on advertising. 
    * I will try to buy this product:  It's possible I might try it once out of curiosity, but it wouldn't be a high priority.
    * I will consider buying this product: If I was experiencing fatigue or saw positive reviews, I might consider it more seriously.
