  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and believe it's good (4) because it clearly states the benefits of the drink, I don't personally find it attractive (1).  This could be because I'm not particularly drawn to advertising that focuses on superficial aspects like "looking your best."

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am intrigued enough to try this product (2) and would consider buying it (3) depending on the taste and other factors. However, as someone who tends to worry a lot and gets nervous easily (traits reflected in my profile), I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it (1) without more research or information about its ingredients and effects.
