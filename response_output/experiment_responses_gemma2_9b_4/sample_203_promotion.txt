**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is simple and straightforward, I find it appealing because it highlights benefits I value (energy and appearance). The language is positive and optimistic. However, I wouldn't call it particularly "good" or "attractive" in a groundbreaking way. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  I'm likely to try this drink.  The ad makes it sound appealing, and as someone who values being energetic and looking good, it aligns with those goals. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately without further information about ingredients, taste, etc. I would definitely consider buying it after trying it. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
