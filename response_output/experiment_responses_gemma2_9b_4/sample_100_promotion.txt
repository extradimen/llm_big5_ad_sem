**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad *interesting* and *good*. It's simple and to the point, which aligns with my preference for clear messaging. However, I don't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*.  It lacks something unique or compelling to grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As someone who is generally trusting but also sometimes rude, I might be swayed by marketing tactics. The ad's promise of energy and looking your best appeals to me on a superficial level. So, I would *intend* to purchase it and *try* it out.  I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it again unless the product genuinely lived up to its claims.
