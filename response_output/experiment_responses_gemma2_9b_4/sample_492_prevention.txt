**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's a decent attempt at persuasion. However, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The "look dull" aspect feels a bit shallow and manipulative.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I might try the product out of curiosity, I wouldn't actively seek it out.  I'm not easily swayed by fear-based marketing tactics ("without this you may feel tired"). My purchase decision would likely depend on other factors like price, reviews, and specific needs.
