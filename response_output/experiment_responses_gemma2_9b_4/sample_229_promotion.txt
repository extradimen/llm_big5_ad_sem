**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad appealing (score of 4), it's not particularly groundbreaking or memorable. It's a fairly common message and doesn't stand out to me.  The "look your best" aspect might be slightly appealing, but it's not something I prioritize heavily.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I *would* likely try this product based on the ad alone (score of 1). The claim of increased energy is something I'd be interested in exploring, especially since I get nervous easily and worry sometimes. However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to buying it without trying first (hence "try" rather than "intend"). If it doesn't work or has a taste I dislike, I wouldn't consider it again (score of 2). 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
