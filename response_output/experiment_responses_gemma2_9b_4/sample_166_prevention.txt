**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's good at conveying its message, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think highly of it aesthetically.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad plays on a common fear (looking tired/dull) which might motivate me to try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without more information about its benefits and effectiveness. I would likely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or testimonials.
