**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad appealing and interesting, I wouldn't necessarily call it "good" or super "attractive." The simplicity of the message is what draws me in.  

* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad definitely piques my interest, and I'd likely try the product based on its promise of energy and looking good. However, I wouldn't immediately commit to purchasing it without further research or seeing it firsthand.
