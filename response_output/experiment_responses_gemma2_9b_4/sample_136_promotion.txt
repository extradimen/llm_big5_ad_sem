  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing (stay energized and look your best), it lacks a certain spark to make me strongly like it.  I find it interesting because those are goals many people have. However, it doesn't stand out as particularly well-made or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright based on this advertisement alone.  I'd need more information about the ingredients, potential side effects, and user reviews before committing to a full purchase. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
