**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **2 (Interesting):** The ad's simple message about feeling tired and looking dull is intriguing enough to catch my attention. 
    * **3 (Good):** I think it effectively conveys a potential problem that many people might relate to.
    * **2 (Like):** While I find it interesting, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally.
    * **1 (Attractive):**  The ad isn't visually or conceptually attractive to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 (Intend):** The ad might make me consider buying the product if I'm already feeling tired or self-conscious about my appearance. 
    * **1 (Try):**  I'd probably be willing to give it a try once, but I wouldn't rush out to buy it based solely on this ad.
    * **3 (Consider):** Ultimately, I'd need more information about the product before making a decision. Factors like price, ingredients, and reviews would influence my choice.



As someone who is reserved but outgoing,  I might be swayed by social pressure or the desire to appear energetic and confident, but I'm not easily persuaded by simple advertising claims.
