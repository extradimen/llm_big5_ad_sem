**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its presentation, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it attractive. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull feels a bit manipulative and doesn't resonate deeply with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because the ad piqued my curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright based on this advertisement alone. I would need more information about the product's ingredients, effectiveness, and reviews before making a firm decision. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
