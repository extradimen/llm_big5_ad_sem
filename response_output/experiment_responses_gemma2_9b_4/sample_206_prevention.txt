**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't personally like it or find it particularly attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I worry a lot and get nervous easily, the idea of feeling tired and dull is concerning. This makes me more likely to at least consider buying the product to avoid those feelings. However, I'm not immediately rushing to purchase it. I'd probably try it first before committing to regular use.
