Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it.  I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention:** This is where things get a bit more complex. The ad promises energy and looking your best â€“ both things that could be appealing to someone like me, given my personality traits. However, I tend to be cautious (strongly disagree with helpfulness, trusting, and thoroughness) and worry a lot.  I'd likely try the product once out of curiosity, but wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness. The "consider" score reflects that possibility if the initial experience is positive.
