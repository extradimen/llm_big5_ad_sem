**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The claims are common in this type of advertisement and don't stand out to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me consider buying the product, especially since I tend to be careless and get nervous easily. The promise of staying energized could appeal to me. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to purchase it immediately. A trial run is more likely. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
