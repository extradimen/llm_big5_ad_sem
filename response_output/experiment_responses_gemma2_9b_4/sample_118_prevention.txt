**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used ("tired and look dull") feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider purchasing this product if I were experiencing fatigue or felt self-conscious about my appearance. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it or actively try to find it. My personality traits suggest I am reserved and sometimes rude, which might lead me to dismiss such advertising claims as superficial.
