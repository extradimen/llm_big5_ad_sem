Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt, I don't particularly like it. It feels a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention. The "look your best" part is also something I wouldn't prioritize.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I am likely to try this product because it promises energy, which can be helpful in my demanding job. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly. I would need to see if it actually delivers on its promise and fits into my lifestyle. 


As someone who gets nervous easily and worries a lot, I tend to be cautious about new products and rely more on tried-and-true options.
