**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. The message is fairly common and lacks something unique that would make me strongly like it.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try the product based on the promise of increased energy and a better appearance. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately without further information about its ingredients, effectiveness, and price. Considering it depends on those factors and my current needs/budget.
