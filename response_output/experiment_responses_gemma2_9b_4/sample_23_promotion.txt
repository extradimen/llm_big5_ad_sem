**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good* in its simplicity and directness, I don't personally find it *likeable* or *attractive*.  The claims are a bit generic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad, I might *intend to purchase* and *try* this product because the promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I would need more information about the product's ingredients and potential side effects before seriously *considering* a purchase. My anxiety makes me cautious about trying new things, especially if they involve consuming something unknown.
