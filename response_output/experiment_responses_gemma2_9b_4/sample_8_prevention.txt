**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me or make me think it's attractive. The "tired and dull" imagery feels a bit dramatic and plays on insecurities. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be persuaded to try the product because of the perceived benefit of avoiding tiredness and looking dull. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it or make a definite plan to buy it. My nervousness and tendency to worry might lead me to overthink whether it's truly necessary.
