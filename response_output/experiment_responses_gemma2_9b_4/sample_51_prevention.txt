**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat well-made, I don't particularly like it. The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") doesn't resonate with me strongly. It feels a bit manipulative. 

Despite my reservations about the ad itself, I might consider buying the product out of curiosity or if I were feeling tired.  I wouldn't actively seek it out, though.
