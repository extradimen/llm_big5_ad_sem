**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't personally like it. It relies on fear tactics ("tired and look dull") which don't resonate with me.  I also wouldn't consider it particularly attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

Even though I'm not a fan of the ad's approach, the promise of feeling energized might be tempting enough to try the product. It's unlikely I'd intend to purchase it outright based on this ad alone, but I might consider buying it if other factors influence my decision (e.g., recommendations from friends or positive reviews).
