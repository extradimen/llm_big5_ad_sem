**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's well-constructed, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I would likely try the product before committing to a full purchase due to my cautious nature (disagree with "generally trusting"). I wouldn't outright buy it without trying it first.  


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
