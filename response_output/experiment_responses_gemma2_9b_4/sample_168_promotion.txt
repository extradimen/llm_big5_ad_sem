  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 4]
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly *like* it. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention.  It's not unattractive either, but it lacks something that would make me strongly favor it.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try the product because the promise of staying energized and looking good is appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away. I'd probably consider buying it after trying it or seeing more specific information about its ingredients and benefits. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
