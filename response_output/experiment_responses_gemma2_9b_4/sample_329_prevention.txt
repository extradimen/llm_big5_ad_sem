**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally find it very attractive. The "tired and dull" imagery feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Although I don't find the ad particularly appealing, the idea of feeling more energetic is something that appeals to me. So, I might consider trying this product if I saw it in a store or heard good reviews from trusted sources. 



As someone who values thoroughness and planning but also worries a lot, I tend to be cautious about new products.  An ad like this wouldn't immediately convince me, but it could spark my curiosity enough to look into it further.
