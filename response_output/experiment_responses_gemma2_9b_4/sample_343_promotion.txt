**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat simplistic and lacking in specifics, it does pique my interest. The promise of staying energized and looking your best appeals to a desire for well-being, which aligns with my helpful and unselfish nature.  However, I wouldn't call it particularly "good" or "attractive."

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad definitely makes me consider purchasing the product. I'm likely to try it based on the positive claims. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it without further research and perhaps seeing testimonials or reviews. My tendency to be careless might lead me to make a purchase decision impulsively, but my emotionally stable nature would likely prompt me to weigh the pros and cons before committing.
