**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad simple and clear, it doesn't particularly excite me.  The claims are common for this type of product, so I'm not blown away.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to try this product because the promise of staying energized and looking my best aligns with my desire to maintain a healthy lifestyle. However, I wouldn't automatically buy it without further research or seeing reviews from people similar to myself.
