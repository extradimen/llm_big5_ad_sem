**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might pique my curiosity enough to try the product, and I could see myself purchasing it if I came across it in a store. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this advertisement alone. My personality traits suggest I'm not easily swayed by marketing claims and prefer to rely on personal recommendations or experiences.
