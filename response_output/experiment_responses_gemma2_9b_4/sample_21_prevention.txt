**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt. However, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try the product because the ad plays on my fears of looking dull and tired. While I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away, I might be persuaded to give it a shot if there was a good deal or promotion. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
