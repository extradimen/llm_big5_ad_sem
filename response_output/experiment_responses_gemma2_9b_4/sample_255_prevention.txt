**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it highly attractive. The message feels a bit manipulative by playing on fears of looking dull and tired. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product. The ad has piqued my curiosity, and the promise of feeling less tired and looking more vibrant is appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy it right away. I would probably try it first before committing to a regular purchase.  


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
