**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good in its simplicity, I wouldn't call it particularly attractive. The fear-based approach isn't very appealing to me personally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me consider trying the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it or even try it based solely on this advertisement. I would likely need more information about the product's ingredients and benefits before making a decision.
