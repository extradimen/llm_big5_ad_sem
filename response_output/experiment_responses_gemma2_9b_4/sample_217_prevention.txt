Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, the language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull").  I don't find it particularly attractive.

* **Purchase Intention:** I am likely to try this product because of the appeal to my worry about feeling "tired and dull". However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away or consider it a necessity. 


My personality traits like being reserved, worrying a lot, and tending to be careless might influence my decision. The ad plays on those worries about feeling inadequate ("dull") which could make me more inclined to try the product as a solution. However, I'm also not easily persuaded and would likely need more convincing before committing to a purchase.
