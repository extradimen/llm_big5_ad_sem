**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its delivery, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels generic and doesn't grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm willing to consider buying this product due to the promise of energy and looking good. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without more information about the ingredients and benefits. A "try" mentality is more realistic given my tendency to worry and need reassurance before making a decision. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of my response!
