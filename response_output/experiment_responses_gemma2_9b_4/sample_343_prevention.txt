**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I wouldn't say I strongly like or find it particularly attractive. The "prevention" angle is familiar and doesn't stand out as particularly innovative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  The ad makes me consider purchasing the product, but I'm not immediately rushing to buy it. Since I value thoroughness and planning, I'd likely research other options and compare before making a decision.
