**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims feel a bit general and not very specific to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me want to try the product. I might even intend to purchase it depending on other factors like price and availability. However, I wouldn't necessarily consider it my first choice, as I worry a lot about making the right decisions and need more convincing information about its benefits.
