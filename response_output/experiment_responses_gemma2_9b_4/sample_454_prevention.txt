**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it attractive. The message relies on fear ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") which isn't particularly appealing to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm inclined to try the product based on the ad, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately. However, if I found myself needing an energy boost or noticed a positive effect from someone else using it, I might consider buying it.
